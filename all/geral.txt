%X Advancement in technology and the World Wide Web have allowed student learning capabilities to expand to unexpected horizons. The majority of today's younger students are computer literate; therefore, new styles of teaching and learning are rapidly developing. Online education is in demand, and universities are rushing into the competitive e-learning marketplace for students. Currently, 6000 accredited college courses are offered online, and 84% of 4-year universities are predicted to offer online courses by 2002. Faculty are expected to expand their teaching styles to include teaching online courses. It is estimated that only 10% to 15% of universities have avoided online programs. Some faculty resist this teaching strategy because of problems encountered when teaching online. Few articles address issues to overcome problems in online education in the nursing literature. This article provides tips on getting a course up and running using the acronym COMMUNICATION. Faculty can use these recommendations to assist them in the development of their online courses.

%X SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Cancer and its treatment has significant impacts on the quality of life of patients and their families. A significant portion of patients experience distress and most patients will benefit through the integration of emotional care throughout their care experience. Nurses play an important role in providing this care and in facilitating appropriate referrals where further expertise or assessment is needed. However, evidence suggests despite a strong desire to integrate this aspect of care into their practice, nurses lack confidence and skill in assessing and managing the complex communication and adjustment issues experiences by patients and their families. Furthermore, although there is some awareness of assessment tools or methods, most nurses do not utilize them or feel uncertain as to how to make referrals with the exception of cases of extreme distress. Purpose: This symposium will provide an overview of a publically funded provincial approach to provide continuing educational courses and as well as at graduate level to nurses at any point along the cancer continuum to assist them to feel more confident and skilled in assessment and provision of emotional care to patients and their families. Learning models include train the trainer programs, elearning modes as well as clinical mentorship. Qualitative and quantitative findings from train the trainer programs and elearning approaches will be presented with a discussion on the implications of the program.

%X It is critical to prepare nurses for future practice to work in teams by engaging students in interprofessional education (IPE) that fosters positive attitudes toward teamwork. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of computer-supported IPE on students' attitudes and perceptions toward health care teamwork and team performance. A hybrid approach to IPE was used to provide students with an educational experience that combined the benefits of traditional face-to-face communication methodology with a computer-mediated platform that focused on reflection and team building. A statistically significant difference was found in students' perceptions of team performance after engaging in computer-supported IPE. No statistically significant difference in students' pretest-posttest composite attitude toward teamwork scores was noted; however, there was a positive trend toward improved scores.

%X Background: In their future vision document 'GP Care in 2020', the Dutch general practice (GP) colleges (LHV-NHG) state that GPs have widely adopted quality-assured point-of-care testing (POCT) in close cooperation with experts from diagnostic centers and laboratories. The patient will profit: more safety, better service and better care. C-reactive protein (CRP) POCT fits the profile. It helps to differentiate pneumonia from other respiratory tract infections within one consultation, thereby enhancing antibiotic stewardship. Objective: To establish a sustainable, robust, easily accessible, quality-assured CRP POCT method for all eligible patients in primary care within the vicinity of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and beyond. Methods: We set out to perform a multi-faceted implementation strategy, building on the scientific evidence of added value of CRP POCT. 1. Evaluation of analytical performance and agreement of CRP POCT devices; 2. Design of a quality-assurance program, incorporating: (a) training for GPs and practice nurses, including e-learning (www.acutehoest.nl); (b) establishing a multidisciplinary Saltro POCT team; 3. (c) actual roll-out of CRP POCT, including regular control visits; (d) a data-connectivity program; 4. Evaluation of phase 2 by GPs and practice nurses; 5. CRP POCT implementation in three GP night/weekend care services. Results 138 GP offices/405 GPs (6500.000 patients) have been contracted, trained, and are now using CRP POCT so far; The number of CRP POC tests increased steadily from 0 in 2010 to an expected 18.000 yearly in 2014; A multidisciplinary POCT team of 13 people is executing the quality assurance program, including home visits for trainings, controls of devices, and adherence to protocols; For patient safety, central control, and automatic transfer of results, a data-connectivity circuit is running in all GP offices; A reimbursement model is used: devices and tests are purchased by Saltro and distributed to the GPs free of charge. After Saltro receives the data from the GPs, the costs of the tests are reimbursed by insurance companies; GPs evaluate CRP POCT quality control (71%) and training (69%) by Saltro very positively; Occasional problems with the execution of the CRP test device are experienced by 23% of practice nurses; Preliminary results (N=222) show that 95% of the GPs in night/weekend care (192 GPs, 6290.000 patients) found the test of added value. Use of CRP POCT reduced referrals to the hospital by 10%. Antibiotics were better targeted, though the number of prescriptions was not reduced. Conclusions High-quality CRP POCT is fully embraced by GPs in routine care in Utrecht (NL) after introduction by Saltro in 2011. The involvement of experts from laboratory or diagnostic centers is considered very important for quality assurance and logistics. Use in night and weekend care shows a preliminary reduction in referrals to the hospital by 10%, together with better selection of patients for antibiotic treatment. A remaining obstacle is the high cost for the software to enable full data-connectivity.

%X Enteral nutrition (EN) support has proven to be a nutrition intervention that can provide full or partial calories to promote growth and development in infants and children. To supply these nutrients, an enteral access device is required, and the use of these devices is growing. Placement of the proper device for the patient need, along with appropriate care and monitoring, is required for individualized patient management. When complications arise, early identification and management can prevent more serious morbidity. Complication management requires a tiered approach starting with staff nurses and ending with a physician expert. In addition to this, each institution needs to have an approach that is coordinated among disciplines and departments to promote consistency of practice. The formation of an enteral access team is a conduit for clinical experts to provide education to families, patients, and healthcare professionals while serving as a platform to address product and practice issues.

%X Background Diabetes is one of the most challenging chronic health conditions in the current era. Diabetes-related foot problems need proper patient education, and social media could a play role to disseminate proper information. Method A systematic search was performed on Facebook groups using the key words “diabetes foot care”, “diabetes foot”, “diabetes foot management” and “podiatric care”. The search resulted in 57 groups and detailed activity information was collected from those groups. Usefulness of each relevant post was determined. Regression analysis was performed to explore the factors associated with the level of usefulness of diabetes foot care-related Facebook groups. Results Our search resulted in a total of 16 eligible diabetes foot care-related Facebook groups with a total of 103 eligible posts. The average number of group members for the selected groups were 265.75 with an interquartile range of 3.5–107.75. Of the total 103 timeline posts, 45.6% posts were categorized as useful, while the remaining posts were not useful. Top mentioned diabetes foot care practice was “Checking feet daily”. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the level of usefulness of diabetes foot care-related Facebook groups were significantly associated with the type of posts and no association was found with presence of “likes” and presence of comment. Conclusion Facebook being a widely used social networking system, patient welfare organizations, doctors, nurses and podiatrists could use this platform to provide support to educating diabetes patients and their caregivers by disseminating useful and authentic knowledge and information related to diabetes foot care.

%X High energy trauma is rare and, as a result, training of prehospital care providers often takes place during the real situation, with the patient as the object for the learning process. Such training could instead be carried out in the context of simulation, out of danger for both patients and personnel. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the development and foci of research on simulation in prehospital care practice. An integrative literature review were used. Articles based on quantitative as well as qualitative research methods were included, resulting in a comprehensive overview of existing published research. For published articles to be included in the review, the focus of the article had to be prehospital care providers, in prehospital settings. Furthermore, included articles must target interventions that were carried out in a simulation context. The volume of published research is distributed between 1984- 2012 and across the regions North America, Europe, Oceania, Asia and Middle East. The simulation methods used were manikins, films, images or paper, live actors, animals and virtual reality. The staff categories focused upon were paramedics, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), medical doctors (MDs), nurse and fire fighters. The main topics of published research on simulation with prehospital care providers included: Intubation, Trauma care, Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Ventilation and Triage. Simulation were described as a positive training and education method for prehospital medical staff. It provides opportunities to train assessment, treatment and implementation of procedures and devices under realistic conditions. It is crucial that the staff are familiar with and trained on the identified topics, i.e., intubation, trauma care, CPR, ventilation and triage, which all, to a very large degree, constitute prehospital care. Simulation plays an integral role in this. The current state of prehospital care, which this review reveals, includes inadequate skills of prehospital staff regarding ventilation and CPR, on both children and adults, the lack of skills in paediatric resuscitation and the lack of knowledge in assessing and managing burns victims. These circumstances suggest critical areas for further training and research, at both local and global levels.

%X Objectives and Backgrounds Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding and associated excessive Patient Experience Times (PETs) have proven deleterious impacts on patient mortality, morbidity and overall length of hospital stay. Health systems constantly seek costeffective organisational strategies to reduce ED crowding and improve patient outcomes, but complex change implementation is constrained by the necessity of maintaining concurrent safe patientcare. Computer modelling in a “virtual reality” has been successfully utilised in industries outside medicine, in providing innovative “realtime” solutions to outdated practices. Therefore a bespoke “Virtual ED” computer model, based on a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) -Based Framework was constructed to determine the best simulation scenarios needed for effective “real-time” strategies to improve PETs in a Dublin teaching hospital ED. The three simulation scenarios tested were: (1) Increasing medical staffing. (2) Increasing assessment space. (3) Enforcing the national 6-h boarding limit. Methods A collaborative interactive decision support model was constructed to analyse patient flow through the ED, considering the variability in patients' arrival rate, the complexity levels of patients' acuity, and the dynamic interactions between key resources (eg, clinical staffing, physical capacity, and spatial relationships). ED Process Mapping utilised IDEF0, for modelling complex systems in a hierarchical form and Extend Suite V.7 software was used to develop the DESdbased framework model. Historical, anonymised ED patient data of 59 986 patient episodes (tracking times, indirect acuity and clinical resource utilisation) was analysed from the “real-time” ED Information System. Baseline ED Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), PETS and resource utilisation was determined for comparison with the DES model. Distinct study scenario variables (Abstract 007 table 1) were added to the DES model and run for 3 month continuous blocks to eliminate confounders. Continuous verification and validation of the ED simulation model was ensured by using Kolmogorove Smirnov goodness of fit test with a 5% significance level. The ultimate results of the simulation model were validated using three techniques; face validation, comparison testing, and hypothesis testing, with the deviation between actual and simulated results ranging from 1% to 9% with an average of only 5% deviation. (Table presente) Results The “Virtual ED” model shows that adoption of the costneutral scenario 3 (Abstract 007 table 2) has the greatest impact on PETs at every stage, especially among patients who are ultimately discharged directly from ED care (48% improvement PETs). Scenario 3 reduces an over-reliance on overstretched nursing resources, while improving the utility of physicians. Furthermore while scenario 3 improves the PETs of boarders, the more expensive Scenarios 1 and 2 have negligible impact on ED boarding times.(Table presente) Conclusions The use of an interactive DES-based framework accurately determines the best simulation scenarios and identifies the most effective “real-time” strategies in improving PETs in an ED environment. While increasing medical staffing or trolley numbers might seem intuitively beneficial to overall PETs, our “Virtual ED” reveals that simply enforcing the national Key Performance Indicator 6-h boarding limit for EDs, would have a greater impact on reducing PETs for all ED patients than increasing medical staff or assessment cubicles. Before instigating potentially ineffectual and costly “real-time” strategies, the construction of novel simulation scenarios in a “Virtual ED” may allow implementation of more effective yet inexpensive bespoke alternatives.

%X Objectives 1. Learn about and understand benefits that advance directives offer patients in hospice care. 2. Discuss advance directives in patients with different demographic variables to help them identify with these groups. This will help them in promoting advance care planning. Background. A general consensus supports the use of advance directives to ensure that patients with serious illnesses receive care that is consistent with their preferences. However, it is not known how the presence of an advance directive influences patients' care during later stages of illness after enrollment in hospice. Research Objectives. To define the population of patients who have an advance directive at the time of hospice enrollment and to determine whether these patients have patterns of care and outcomes that are different than those without advance directives. Methods. We examined the timing of enrollment in hospice relative to death. We used kaplan meier survival curves with the log rank test to evaluate unadjusted differences in survival and we used a cox proportional hazards model to examine differences in survival between patients with and without advance directives after adjusting for the propensity score. We examined the proportion of patients with short (<1 week) and very short (<1 day) length of stay in hospice using bivariate analysis after propensity score adjustment. We used a similar survival analysis approach to compare rates of voluntary withdrawal from hospice, censoring for death. Finally, we restricted the sample to patients who died in hospice (excluding withdrawals) and examined the association between advance directives and site of death (home or nursing home vs. hospital or inpatient hospice unit) using both bivariate analysis and propensity score adjustment. Results. Among 49,370 patients, 35,968 (73%) had advance directives at the time of hospice enrollment. These patients had a longer course of hospice care prior to death (median 29 vs. 15 days, adjusted hazard ratio: 0.62; 95% CI 0.58- 0.66; p<0.001), and were less likely to enroll during the last week of life (24.3% vs. 33.2%; adjusted OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.88; p<0.001). Patients with advance directives were also less likely to leave hospice voluntarily (2.2% vs. 3.4%; adjusted OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90; p=0.003) and more likely to die in a private home or nursing home vs. an inpatient unit (15.3% vs. 25.8%; adjusted OR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.87; p<0.001). Conclusions. Patients with advance directives were enrolled in hospice for a longer period of time prior to their death and have outcomes, such as death at home, which are more consistent with the principles of hospice care. Implications for research, policy, or practice. It is important to understand whether, and how, advance directives shape trajectories of care in hospice. With this knowledge, clinicians will be better able to serve their patients and their community at large. Hopefully, this will be a platform to help clinicians realize other advantages of advance directives and will help to motivate them to promote them in their hospices as well as in their community.

%X Aim: To up skill and reinvigorate health visitors across England to be able to provide a quality service with respect to case finding and the management of mild to moderate perinatal mental illness. Background: The training programme was supported by the Department of Health, England as part of the current government's 'Call to Action' to strengthen health visiting services by the creation of 4200 new health visitors. The speakers will describe the creation, practice of, and outcomes from the programme. Each Champion was selected for their existing experience in the field, and for their enthusiasm to drive change. The Champions went through a very intense 2-day evidence based training delivered by Dr Jane Hanley supported by Dr Cheryll Adams, or another co-trainer. The training was very robust being supported by a training pack and e-learning allowing it to then be cascaded to other colleagues-health visitors, midwives and community nurses and some general practitioners in practice, with the Champion's role also being used as a source of local PMH expertise, but with on-going support from the iHV. Almost 400 Perinatal Mental Health Champion (PMH) Health Visitors were trained across England and so far the training has been cascaded to over 3000 health visitors with many new services being developed as a result. The success of this national training model has been very significant. It has gone far beyond the original objectives and has been followed closely by our government who funded it. So much so that they subsequently invested in training more Champions and providing support to the iHV to explore the outcomes from the project and to further support and develop Champions in areas where the roll out of training was slower. Speakers at the symposium will include those who designed and delivered the training, those who are now responsible cascading it and those who are monitoring its outcomes. Included are case studies from the iHV PMH Champions describing what this new role has meant for their practice and local services, and the many and varied outcomes resulting.

%X Human patient simulation (HPS) is increasingly being used as both a teaching and an evaluation strategy in nursing education. To meaningfully evaluate student performance in HPS activities, nurse educators must be equipped with valid and reliable instruments for measuring student performance. This study used a novel method, including leveled, video-archived simulation scenarios, a virtual classroom, and webinar and e-mail communication, to assess the reliability and internal consistency of data produced using the Creighton Simulation Evaluation Instrument. The interrater reliability, calculated using intraclass correlation (2,1) and 95% confidence interval, was 0.952 (0.697, 0.993). The intrarater reliability, calculated using intraclass correlation (3,1) and 95% confidence interval, was 0.883 (-0.001, 0.992), and the internal consistency, calculated using Cronbach's alpha, was α = 0.979. This article includes a sample of the instrument and provides valuable resources and reliability data for nurse educators and researchers interested in measuring student performance in HPS activities. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X Given the state of infrastructure and resources in Africa, development of cancer research is going to be a challenge. Carefully developed and systematic research program that takes advantage of existing infrastructure particularly that provided by the unprecedented investment in health care infrastructure, training and logistics that occurred through the PEPFAR program; proactive identification, local and international training and mentoring of local faculty; careful prioritization of research agenda are required for a successful long term research collaborations. Since July 2009, IHV, IHVN and collaborators in Nigeria have engaged in development of AIDS Associated Cancer Research and have laid foundations for future collaboration. 2 cervical cancer screening and treatment programs have provided service for 2002 women in the last 12 months and found 6.8% VIA positivity, 0.2% cervical cancer and 0.2% uncertain lesions prevalence. This nurse provider led program uses off the shelf digital camera to do digital cervicography that is reviewed weekly for QA/QC by gynecologist. VIA+ lesions are treated with cold coagulation and there has been no complication. A case control study of HPV and Cervical Premalignant lesion in HIV+ and HIVwomen is scheduled to start shortly taking advantage of this platform. 4 cancer registration and epidemiology trainings have been conducted for 20 cancer registries, 5 of which are now at the level of population based cancer registries providing good quality data. This data will be analyzed and published as first national cancer incidence and survival data from Nigeria. Upon completion of the IHVN data center, an AIDS Cancer Match analysis is scheduled for shortly after.

%X Purpose: The degree to which electronic health records (EHRs) enhance the quality of patient care depends on use of the system to monitor and improve practice. In planning the transition to Epic's Beacon electronic chemotherapy ordering platform, we saw an opportunity to measure our performance and increase evidence-based practice. Methods: Advanced planning began 2 years before implementation and included formation of a chemotherapy council charged with reviewing references and approving each chemotherapy protocol; a readiness assessment; design of electronic flow-sheet adherent with Oncology Nursing Society guidelines. To monitor use of evidence-based treatments, we created a novel quality metric: the rate of evidence-based adherence (REBA). Results: A full infusion schedule was maintained through implementation, with a transient 1-month increase in wait time. Our overallREBAof 0.86 significantly exceeded our prespecified goal of 0.80 (P = .001). REBA varied from 0.50 to 0.95 between disease groups. Antiemetic use increased by 20% after Beacon implementation. Provider satisfaction at 8 months ranged from 76% to 80%. Conclusion: The transition to electronic chemotherapy ordering offers an institution the chance to develop evidence-based oncology practice, standardize supportive care, and enhance patient safety. The key elements that made our transition so successful were (1) extensive involvement of oncology leadership, (2) use of a chemotherapy council to enforce evidence-based practice, (3) ongoing collaboration between clinical operations and information technology. Finally, the REBA is a powerful tool to monitor adherence to evidence-based chemotherapy prescribing. Copyright © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

%X Introduction: Pre-eclampsia and its associated complications are the leading cause of maternal death in Nigeria. Many of these deaths occur at home or in primary health centres. Nevertheless, management of pre-eclampsia is limited to secondary and tertiary facilities. In Nigeria, community-based health workers serve as a bridge between the community and health facilities; therefore, these providers may be key in reducing the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes by way of early detection and treatment. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the ability of communitybasedhealthworkers to safely administermethyldopa, magnesiumsulphate, and complete referral to a higher level facility when indicated. Methods: The Community Level Intervention for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) study was implemented by community-based health workers in Ogun State, Nigeria. These providers (i.e., Community Health Extension Workers, Health Assistants, midwives and nurses) utilized a mHealth platform to guide antenatal and postnatal visits, preeclampsia treatment with oral methyldopa (one dose = 750 mg) and intramuscular magnesium sulphate (one dose = 10 mg) prior to referral, based on evidence-based practice and the miniPIERS (Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimated of RiSk) model. Results: Findings of this study indicate that community-based health workers inNigeria safely administered 137 doses of magnesium sulphate; this resulted in no infections or hematomas. Fifty-one doses of magnesium sulphate were given by community health extension workers, while nurses administered sixty-four: the high rate of administration by nurses can be explained by turf protection as well as their seniority within the health system. In addition, there were 139 doses of methyldopa administered, and a total of 127 urgent referrals completed. No safety concerns were reported. Conclusion: These findings confirm the ability of communitybased health workers to safely administer magnesium sulphate for severe pre-eclampsia with appropriate training; this is a big step towards reducing the negative impact of pre-eclampsia in Nigeria. The use of task-sharing, therefore, could drastically reduce the three delays (triage, transport and treatment) associated with high maternal mortality and morbidity in rural communities in low and middle-income countries.

%X Objective: To develop an interdisciplinary special interest group, (ISIG) as a communication platform for optimization of interdisciplinary therapies of movement disorders. Background: Increasing complexity of therapeutic strategies for movement disorders requires interdisciplinary therapies involving several medical and non-medical therapists. Coordinating all different involved professions is difficult. Methods: Since October 2006 20-35 physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, nurses and physicians and invited guests are meeting each third Wednesday of each quarter 7-10:30 p.m. as a semi opened group. Results: ISIG meetings covered the followings topics: 1. Development of a communication form, (referral sheet) to facilitate flow of information about treated patients amongst different therapists. 2. Development and training of classificatory systems to harmonize communication. 3. Introduction and training of quantification systems to measure treatment effects. 4. Discussion of case studies to optimize treatment strategies. 5. Presentations of specific movement disorders to improve and harmonize general knowledge of movement disorders. 6. Development of a webpage and a data base of ISIG therapists to facilitate internal and external communications. Conclusions: ISIG stability over more than 4 years documents its demand. ISIG promote interdisciplinary therapies for movement disorders, facilitate internal communication amongst involved therapists as well as external communication with patients and referring physicians. They may also play an important role in continuing medical education. ISIG should also be incorporated in emerging treatment guidelines.

%X Introduction: Across hospitals, a subpopulation of patients admitted for medical and surgical care exhibit challenging behaviors due to delirium, dementia and/or mental illness. These behaviors include agitation and resistance-to-care. These behaviors compromise care delivery and increase the risk of unintentional physical harm and burn-out. The Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile (GIAP) survey results indicated that nurses were burdened by caring for patients with behavioral issues and employee survey results demonstrated that staff faced a significant risk of violence. Historically, some of these patients were referred to psychiatric consultation-liaison teams for management of their comorbid mental illness. This relied on physician-initiated consultation despite the safety risks of challenging behavior falling more heavily on nursing staff. Emerging evidence suggests that proactive models bring specialized support to frontline clinicians effectively and preventively. There is also growing recognition that the care of the psychogeriatric patient, particularly those with behavioral disturbances, requires an interdisciplinary approach. Furthermore, non-pharmacologic approaches are often the first line intervention for many challenging behaviors; yet frontline staff consistently report struggles in implementing and sustaining these approaches. Methods: In recognition of the challenges faced by nurses and allied health staff in safely providing care for psychogeriatric patients with behavioral disturbances, the Safe Patients/Safe Staff™ (SP/SS) program was developed and piloted at one Academic Health Science Centre. The SP/SS program consists of a behavioral rapid response team, standardized tools and multimodal education. The goals of the program are to improve the safety and self-efficacy of front-line clinicians responsible for the care of patients with challenging behaviors due to delirium, dementia and mental illness, and ensure best practice care of this patient population. The behavioral rapid response team is comprised of two advanced practice nurses (APNs) and a geriatric psychiatrist, and uses an inter-professional team model to provide consultation, behavioral care planning using a range of standardized tools, and support to frontline staff. The APNs provide direct consultation with nurses, focusing on the development, implementation and evaluation of nursing care plans to target management of specific challenging behaviors. Standardized tools based on best practice guidelines include assessment forms, care plans for common behavioral issues, and a behavioral care plan discharge summary. Involvement of the behavioral rapid response team is supported by a policy that allows consultation to be triggered based on the presence of several high-risk/high-need criteria. Thus, frontline interdisciplinary team members, specifically nurses and allied health workers, can access psychiatric consultation for patients without waiting for formal physician consultation Multimodal education was developed and delivered to nursing and allied health staff. This education included e-learning modules on delirium screening and the management of behavioral issues, classroom based lectures on a range of topics including personhood, and interactive training sessions on managing challenging behaviors arising due to dementia. Results: Within two years of implementation, the Safe Patients/Safe Staff™ program has demonstrated positive outcomes. Implementation of the behavioral rapid response team has led to more patients and staff receiving support. For example, in July 2014, 46 patients were flagged to the advanced practice nurses, 6 through face-to-face referral from nursing staff and 40 through an automated daily report of patients who have displayed aggressive behavior. Of these patients, 15 received a consultation, 8 were already followed by the team, and the remaining 23 patients were reviewed and found to not have behavioral issues (a documentation error led to their inclusion on the automated daily report). Another k y omponent of the SP/SS™ program is the multimodal education. One component of this education is interactive workshops on the care of patients with delirium, dementia and challenging behaviors patients. Pre- and post-evaluations of knowledge and self-efficacy has demonstrated improved self-efficacy from an average of 7.15 to 8.23 (rating on a 0-10 scale). A similar improvement in knowledge scores was seen at six months post intervention, indicating sustained improvement. The Geriatric Institutional Assessment Profile (GIAP) results also showed a statistically significant drop in the burden of behavioral disturbance score from 4.6 in 2011 to 4.2 in 2012, with a repeat survey planned for early 2015. Conclusions: The Safe Patients/Safe Staff™ program has demonstrated a benefit to this organization with the potential to improve the care and safety of patients and staff in other acute care hospitals.

%X Objective: The results from a recent national survey about catastrophic complications following tracheostomy revealed that the majority of events involved a loss of airway. Most of the events due to airway loss involved potentially correctable deficits in caregiver education. Training in a simulated environment allows skill acquisition without compromising patient safety. We assessed the knowledge and confidence level of pediatric health care providers at a large tertiary care children's hospital in routine and emergency tracheostomy care and evaluated the efficacy of a comprehensive simulation-based tracheostomy educational program. Methods: The prospective observational study was comprised of 33 subjects including pediatric residents, internal medicine-pediatric residents, pediatric hospitalist faculty physicians, and advanced practice registered nurses who are involved in the care of patients with tracheostomies within a tertiary-care children's hospital. The subjects completed self-assessment questionnaires and objective multiple-choice tests before and after attending a comprehensive educational course that employed patient simulation. The outcome measurements included pre- and post-course questionnaires, pre- and post-course test scores, and observational data from the simulation sessions. Results: Before the education and simulation, the subjects' comfort and confidence levels on a five-point Likert scale in performing routine tracheostomy tube care, routine tracheostomy tube change, and an emergency tracheostomy tube change were as follows (median (Q1, Q3)): 1 (1, 2), 1 (1, 2), and 1 (1, 2), respectively (n=28). The levels of comfort and confidence after completing the course improved significantly to 4 (4, 5), 4 (4, 5), 4 (4, 5), respectively (P<0.001) (n=20). For the knowledge assessment, the pre-course test mean score was 0.53±0.50, and the scores on the post-course test improved significantly with a mean score of 0.82±0.39 (P<0.001). During the educational intervention, specific deficiencies observed included a lack of understanding or familiarity with different types of tracheostomy tubes (e.g., cuffed versus uncuffed), physiological significance of the cuff, mechanism of action and physiological significance of the speaking valve, and the importance of the obturator in changing the tracheostomy tube. Conclusion: There is a need for improved tracheostomy education among pediatric health care providers. Incorporation of patient-simulation into a tracheostomy educational program was effective in improving knowledge, confidence, and skills.

%X Background: We sought to implement patient reported outcomes (PRO) surveys to measure the acute and late effects of radiation treatment at a multisite academic medical center. Methods: Over the course of 18 months we addressed survey identification and implementation hurdles. Many existing validated instruments were designed for clinical research and are not ideally suited for either routine care or for the tracking of acute toxicities of radiation therapy. A physician and a nurse champion for each disease site identified or created situation- and site-specific tools based on validated questionnaires form the literature. Our aim was for questionnaires to be no longer than 20 - 30 questions. Using iPads, we deployed an institutionally-developed survey platform integrated with scheduling within the clinic. We surveyed physicians, nurses, and residents 3 months following the implementation of PROMs to assess their general response to the initiative. Results: Thirty-seven PRO measures comprised of 640 questions were implemented for all disease sites in adult patients at 6 departmental locations treating a total of 350 patients daily. Following implementation in January of 2015, > 13,000 surveys have been completed through the end of September 2015. Each question took on average approximately 14 seconds to complete and common surveys took approximately 10 minutes. Of 36 departmental provider respondents (50% response rate overall), 47% stated that they use the PROMs in their daily practice. The majority of respondents felt that the PROs were valuable (67%) and relevant (75%) either usually, most of the time or always. Only 33% felt the quality of their care was enhanced usually or most of the time while 53% felt the PROs engaged patients in a better understanding of their own care. Conclusions: We successfully implemented disease site- and context-specific PROs across a large, academic radiation oncology department. Although we have achieved widespread adoption and some subjective impression of care improvement among providers, further work is necessary to reduce barriers to their clinical use and to leverage them for systematic improvements in care.

%X Objectives 1. Identify tools and interventions to improve family satisfaction with care at the end of life. 2. Facilitate the implementation of quality improvement tools within different practice settings. 3. Educate providers and staff about the effective use of quality improvement tools in practice. This session will review the use of toolkits in aiding quality improvement initiatives, specifically the use of the “Strive for 65 Implementation Package” in increasing scores on the Veterans Health Administration's Bereaved Family Survey. We will review the content of the “Strive for 65 Implementation Package,” including its development, design, and how its tools can be used to increase patient and family satisfaction at the end of life. Using an interactive, hands-on platform, session attendees will have the opportunity to choose between five featured tools and learn strategies for tool implementation. The featured tools can be used throughout the timeline of a patient's hospitalization stay: Upon Patient and Family Arrival • “Fostering Good Impressions” practical guidance for welcoming patients/families to the palliative care setting, making them comfortable, and setting the standard of comfort, care and respect from the time of admission. During Care • “Palliative Care Nursing Assistant Project: Key Words at Key Times” communication training for these critical front-line staff in the language of family satisfaction. • “Comfort and Communication in the ICU” a comprehensive package consisting of a family meeting planner and guide, comfort and communication pocket card, and interdisciplinary, electronic documentation template, to promote effective, timely and empathic interdisciplinary communication and family meetings. Dying Phase • “Comfort Care Order Set” an electronic order set for comfort care measures. After Death • “Bereavement Follow Up” a systematized approach to ensuring adequate bereavement acknowledgement and support for families.

%X Background: Studies involving samples of children with life-threatening illnesses and their families face significant challenges, including inadequate sample sizes and limited diversity. Social media recruitment and Web-based research methods may help address such challenges yet have not been explored in pediatric cancer populations. Objective: This study examined the feasibility of using Facebook advertisements to recruit parent caregivers of children and teenagers with cancer. We also explored the feasibility of Web-based video recording in pediatric palliative care populations by surveying parents of children with cancer regarding (a) their preferences for research methods and (b) technological capabilities of their computers and phones. Methods: Facebook's paid advertising program was used to recruit parent caregivers of children currently living with cancer to complete an electronic survey about research preferences and technological capabilities. Results: The advertising campaign generated 3 897 981 impressions, which resulted in 1050 clicks at a total cost of $1129.88. Of 284 screened individuals, 106 were eligible. Forty-five caregivers of children with cancer completed the entire electronic survey. Parents preferred and had technological capabilities for Web-based and electronic research methods. Participant survey responses are reported. Conclusion: Facebook was a useful, cost-effective method to recruit a diverse sample of parent caregivers of children with cancer. Web-based video recording and data collection may be feasible and desirable in samples of children with cancer and their families. Implications for Practice: Web-based methods (eg, Facebook, Skype) may enhance communication and access between nurses and pediatric oncology patients and their families.

%X The aims of this study were to determine whether the introduction of a diabetes management e-module can increase junior doctors' confidence in managing inpatients with diabetes and contribute to improvements in patient care. A diabetes e-module was introduced at Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust in October 2010. Junior doctors completed it and undertook an online exam at the end. Junior doctors were surveyed once, six to eight months after completing the e-module, and retrospectively ranked their confidence and knowledge levels in managing inpatients with diabetes before and after completing the e-module. Patient care was assessed by comparing the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA) findings at Barnet Hospital before and at two time points after the introduction of the e-module. After undertaking the e-module there were statistically significant increases in the selfranked confidence and knowledge levels of junior doctors regarding diabetes management. This included improvements in identifying different types of insulin, making insulin dose adjustments for hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia and a reduction in reported prescription errors. The results from the NaDIA also suggest an improvement in 'good diabetes days' for insulin-treated patients with diabetes and a pattern of reduction in prescription and management errors. This study demonstrates that an inpatient diabetes management e-module increases junior doctors' knowledge and confidence in managing diabetes. A multi-centre study would be needed to confirm whether this translates into better management of inpatients with diabetes. E-modules may be used to cover further topics in diabetes, and to support nursing and patient education. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons.

%X Background: Associations between nursing home residents' oral health status and quality of life, respiratory tract infections, and nutritional status have been reported. Educational interventions for nurses or residents, or both, focusing on knowledge and skills related to oral health management may have the potential to improve residents' oral health. Objectives: To assess the effects of oral health educational interventions for nursing home staff or residents, or both, to maintain or improve the oral health of nursing home residents. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 18 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 18 January 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 18 January 2016), CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 18 January 2016), and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 18 January 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials to 18 January 2016. In addition, we searched reference lists of identified articles and contacted experts in the field. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing oral health educational programmes for nursing staff or residents, or both with usual care or any other oral healthcare intervention. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened articles retrieved from the searches for relevance, extracted data from included studies, assessed risk of bias for each included study, and evaluated the overall quality of the evidence. We retrieved data about the development and evaluation processes of complex interventions on the basis of the Criteria for Reporting the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in healthcare: revised guideline (CReDECI 2). We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information. Main results: We included nine RCTs involving 3253 nursing home residents in this review; seven of these trials used cluster randomisation. The mean resident age ranged from 78 to 86 years across studies, and most participants were women (more than 66% in all studies). The proportion of residents with dental protheses ranged from 62% to 87%, and the proportion of edentulous residents ranged from 32% to 90% across studies. Eight studies compared educational interventions with information and practical components versus (optimised) usual care, while the ninth study compared educational interventions with information only versus usual care. All interventions included educational sessions on oral health for nursing staff (five trials) or for both staff and residents (four trials), and used more than one active component. Follow-up of included studies ranged from three months to five years. No study showed overall low risk of bias. Four studies had a high risk of bias, and the other five studies were at unclear risk of bias. None of the trials assessed our predefined primary outcomes 'oral health' and 'oral health-related quality of life'. All trials assessed our third primary outcome, 'dental or denture plaque'. Meta-analyses showed no evidence of a difference between interventions and usual care for dental plaque (mean difference -0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.17; six trials; 437 participants; low quality evidence) or denture plaque (standardised mean difference -0.60, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.05; five trials; 816 participants; low quality evidence). None of the studies assessed adverse events of the intervention. Authors' conclusions: We found insufficient evidence to draw robust conclusions about the effects of oral health educational interventions for nursing home staff and residents. We did not find evidence of meaningful effects of educational interventions on any measure of residents' oral health; however, the quality of the available evidence is low. More adequately powered and high-qu li y studies using relevant outcome measures are needed.

%X Background: There are few data published the comparison of drug management standards in healthcare settings. In 2008, Accreditation Canada proposed the Qmentum program built on ongoing enhancements to quality care and patient safety. This standard, which focuses on the drug circuit (i.e. the 54 steps identified from drug selection/purchasing, to prescribing, validating, preparing, dispensing, administering, disposing, etc.) within any institution, is written with the help of the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists and the Canadian Institute for Safe Medication Practice (ISMP-Canada), while taking into account the criteria of the American ISMP Medication Safety Self-Assessment tool for Automated Dispensing Cabinets. This tool has been designed to help hospitals assess their medication safety practices surrounding the use of automated dispensing cabinets, identifying opportunities for improvement, and comparing experiences with the aggregate experience of demographically similar hospitals, when local data are entered into their platform. Objective: To evaluate and compare the clarity and the assessability of criteria for the Drug Management Standard proposed by the Joint Commission in United States of America and Accreditation Canada. Methods: Criteria common to each respective standard (2008 version) were paired (143 Canadian/103 American criteria). Our research group (n=12) rated the clarity of each statement (unclear if panel member does not understand what it means) and the assessability (unassessable if panel member does not believe he could evaluate the conformity) of each criterion. For each theme, the proportion of Canadian criteria that had an American equivalent was calculated. Results: Only 43% of Canadian criteria can be paired to an American criterion and 69% of American criteria can be paired to a Canadian criterion. Four of the 22 themes of the Canadian standard had no equivalent criteria in the American norm. Panel members of the pharmacy practice group judged the clarity and assessability of the criteria more severely than panel members from the nursing group (p<0.05). Forty-one percent of the criteria were considered clear by all the panel members and 14% were considered assessable by all the panel members. No criterion was considered unclear or unassessable by all the panel members. Conclusion: There are limited data published on the drug management standards used by accreditation organisms. A better understanding of these standards and a comparison with those from other countries may help us to think about the relevance of these standards of practice.

%X Background: e-learning is a potentially costeffective, flexible method for training health professionals in obesity management. Aims: Pilot the Weight4KIDs health professional e-learning program for paediatric obesity management to assess its uptake, acceptability and impact on participant learning outcomes. Methods: Weight4KIDs is a series of 11 e-learning modules: a core module (basic assessment and initial management) and advanced modules (physical measurements, practical interventions, adolescent obesity, general medical issues, endocrine aspects, orthopaedic issues, nutrition, physical activity, sleep and psychosocial issues). Health professionals from six sites (three non-metropolitan) were invited to complete modules. Participants' knowledge on module topics was assessed at baseline. A post-training survey assessed participants' knowledge, views on module duration/content and intention to improve clinical practice. Results: The core module took 20 min (median) [IQR: 13-37] to complete (n = 130; 71% nurses; 55% non-metropolitan). Participation in advanced modules varied (range: n = 18-70) with median completion times across modules ranging from 2 to 10 min. In all modules there was a statistically significant (P < 0.05; related-samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) improvement in participants' preto post-training knowledge scores. Most participants (range across all modules) indicated module completion: occurred during work time (58-84%), was of appropriate duration (81-100%) and detail (83-96%), and prompted intention to improve clinical practice (74-93%). Conclusions: Weight4KIDs improved participants' knowledge of paediatric obesity management and was highly acceptable to a predominately nursing sample. The results support wider rollout of Weight4KIDs. The poor uptake by medical and allied health staff warrants further investigation.

%X Background: Standard academic training for acute care advanced practice nurses (APNs) and registered nurses (RNs) in the United States has evolved into a “generalist-hospitalist” model that includes less than 30 min didactic content on stroke, causing many nurses to have to learn stroke management “on the job.” This results in diverse levels of knowledge and clinical skills, and limits nurses' essential contributions to quality acute stroke hospital services. Methods: We developed and implemented NET SMART-AP, a post- Masters acute neurovascular fellowship in 2008, and the NET SMART-Junior program for acute stroke RNs in 2011 using a novel, hybrid internet-based didactic/clinical training approach. All didactic content in the program is standardized and accessible via the on-line platform 24/7, and clinical skills training exercises supporting application of new knowledge are completed with both local learning partner oversight and distant faculty review. Registrants must pass both the written examination and clinical application components to progress through each aspect of the program, and fellows enrolled in NET SMART-AP must complete a final on-site clinical validation Session under the leadership of program faculty to ensure mastery of program content and skills prior to graduation. The primary aim of the NET SMART program is to increase the early identification and treatment of acute stroke patients, with outcomes measured during and after program completion. Results: The first NET SMART-AP class (N = 18) graduated in 2010; baseline tPA treatment rates increased over a period of 1.4 years from 3.3% to 11.6% at the time of APN fellow program completion (paired t = 9.34; mean difference = 8.3, 95%CI = 6.4- 10.2; P < .001) without a significant increase in acute stroke patient admissions and an average sICH rate of 4.4% (range 2%-6.25%). Within this APN cohort, 100% of sponsoring vascular neurologists rated themselves as confident in their graduates' ability to appropriately select and manage candidates for reperfusion therapy. Since this time, an additional 23 fellows have graduated from the program. The NET SMART-Junior program has enrolled a total of 2,577 RNs from across the U.S., with the first cohort due to graduate in 2012. Two certifying examinations have been developed for graduates of NET SMART programs and are offered through the Association of Neurovascular Clinicians (www.anvc.net): ANVP (Advanced Neurovascular Practitioner) for graduate APN fellows and the NVRN (Neurovascular Registered Nurse). Conclusions: Specialized education and clinical training in acute stroke treatment and management are essential to ensuring rapid recognition of patients that are candidates for reperfusion therapy. Completion of the NET SMART-AP Fellowship is associated with a safe and significant increase in tPA treatment, while analysis of the benefit of NET SMART-Junior is underway. Distance-accessible. hybrid learning and training programs for acute stroke nurses ensure provision of standardized evidence-based content and optimal nursing contributions.

%X This article reports on an informal survey conducted for the Theory Development Section of the Midwest Nursing Research Society. Its purposes were to describe current practices in teaching nursing theory at three levels of curricula and to compare these practices between nursing programs in liberal arts colleges and research universities, between schools with and without doctoral programs, and between faculty with nursing and nonnursing doctorates who teach nursing theory. Findings indicate greatest consistency of practices at baccalaureate and doctoral levels, though few baccalaureate programs have required courses in nursing theory. Few differences were found between types of schools, but faculty with nursing doctorates tended to emphasize theory-practice linkages at the baccalaureate level. Further study that uses this work as a platform is suggested. Copyright © 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.

%X Background: The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissue and Organs (SaBTO), prompted by inconsistent practice across the UK, issued recommendations around the need for patient information and valid consent for blood transfusion. Aims and methods: We undertook a national comparative audit in 2014 of patient information and consent in adults receiving elective red cell transfusion. Centres were asked to complete an organizational survey around availability of guidelines and training. Case notes were audited to assess if the indication for transfusion was documented, if consent had been obtained and if the patient had been given written information about blood transfusion. Patients were invited to complete a questionnaire and a staff survey was also undertaken. Results: 141 sites completed the organisational survey with 89% indicating that they had a policy on consent for transfusion, with the majority stating the need to provide information to patients. 164 sites provided patient data on 2784 cases for the case note documentation audit. The demographics were representative of the wider patient population requiring blood transfusion. Of these, 81% had documentation of the clinical indication for transfusion in the notes. Evidence for documentation of patient consent for transfusion was found in 43%; this was largely verbal consent. In nearly 80% of cases, consent was obtained by doctors and of these 72% were junior trainees. While 85% of staff stated that they had explained the reason for transfusion to the patient, only 63% stated that they had documented this; it was only evident in 37% of notes reviewed that the reason for transfusion had been explained to the patient. The proportion of patients stating that they received information on risks was 38% and 8% for alternatives. These low levels are reflected in the case note audit with documentation that information was given on risks in 23% and on alternatives in 17%.The provision of written information to patients on transfusion was overall low as highlighted by the case note audit (19% documented as receiving these) as well as the patient feedback (28% recalled receiving these) and staff feedback (18% of staff provided these), demonstrating a major discordance with written policies within Trusts. Despite the above, 75% of patients felt they had been given enough information on transfusion and had been able to ask questions. However 21% stated that they did not feel at all involved in the decision making process around receiving a blood transfusion. Only 38% of medical and 24% of nursing respondents had used an eLearning module on patient consent and transfusion. Summary and conclusions: There is an urgent need to improve practice around patient information and consent on transfusion with emphasis on documentation within the clinical records. Junior doctors in particular are involved in prescribing blood and this audit highlights an urgent need to strengthen their training in relation to consent and appropriate prescribing. The development and dissemination of patient leaflets needs review with a need to explore innovative methods to provide information to patients including use of information technology.

%X Background and Aims: Clinical staff involved in blood transfusion must receive training on the safe and appropriate use of blood and undergo competency-based training. Yet the Serious Hazards of Transfusion UK haemovigilance scheme highlights avoidable errors with potential serious consequences often involving clinical staff. On behalf of the National Blood Transfusion Committee in England, this survey was carried out to assess content and delivery of training in Transfusion Medicine at UK undergraduate medical schools and also foundation schools for year 1 and 2 trainee doctors to identify areas where additional focus is needed. Methods: A survey compiled using the Survey Monkey tool was circulated to 31 UK Medical Schools and to 25 Foundation Schools. Results: All schools covered transfusion medicine training with haematologists and specialist transfusion nurse practitioners delivering the majority of training. The responses are summarised in table 1. Summary/Conclusions: The profile of transfusion education clearly needs to be raised in undergraduate medical and foundation training for junior doctors. Considerable variation exists in content, delivery and assessment. Key areas including special requirements & paediatric transfusion are inadequately covered. A comprehensive, co-ordinated approach with increasing use of e-learning modules with standardised, mandatory formal assessments are vital to ensure adequate training of junior doctors to reduce transfusion errors. We are also undertaking a review of the transfusion content in all curricula as approved by the General Medical Council in the UK for the various acute postgraduate disciplines with a view to improving overall transfusion medicine training.

%X Recent research highlights how community-based approaches to HCV can optimise access, adherence and outcomes of HCV patients. A Multidisciplinary Educational Masterclass Series was organised for healthcare professionals (HP) working in primary care. An online educational tool was then developed from the outcomes of the Masterclass Series. From local general practice: NGOs, Addiction Treatment Services, GPs and other HPs working in primary care (n = 34) were invited to two one-day symposiums (Hepatitis C Masterclass) that examined: how to prevent new infections, why/how to screen, new approaches to diagnosis and treatment and treating coexisting problem alcohol use. Their feedback informed the development of an educational online tool to enhance multidisciplinary approaches to HCV treatment. The tool was constructed and forwarded to a panel of select HPs whose feedback further developed the tool. An evaluation tool was then produced to assess the feasibility of the educational tool. A majority of HPs 'strongly agreed/agreed' that the Masterclass helped HPs 'appreciate the role of primary care' and 'secondary care' in 'the management of patients with HCV' as well as 'describing new approaches' to HCV 'assessment (Fibroscan)' and 'treatment'. Assigning a 'designated nurse to liaise with hospital services' was deemed 'useful/very useful' by a majority of participants. Some expanded on the topic claiming that a nurse liaison is 'vital' when 'joining the dots' of a patient's treatment and is needed to 'ease communications' between different sectors of care. The high satisfaction rates associatedwith theMasterclass highlighted the importance of multidisciplinary-based approaches to HCV and allowed the subsequent development of an educational online platform.

%X Nurse practitioners (NPs) can take an active role in defining and establishing their careers. Prepared as advanced practice nurses with specific assessment skills, primary care NPs have the opportunity to become independent or collaborative practitioners. This report examines the published work in the area of practice choice and motivational-needs behavior. Interviews with collaborative and independent primary care NPs were conducted. Against the framework of well-established personality testing methods, open-ended interview questions were developed to elicit specific motivational-needs-based behavior characteristics. The motivational needs examined included the need for achievement, power, and affiliation. The interview findings were then synthesized using needs-based behavior theory. This new platform for role decision ultimately can prepare NPs to make informed career choices.

%X BACKGROUND: The use of opinion leaders is a strategy used to speed the process of translating research into practice. Much is still unknown about opinion leader attributes and activities and the context in which they are most effective. Agent-based modeling is a methodological tool that enables demonstration of the interactive and dynamic effects of individuals and their behaviors on other individuals in the environment. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an agent-based model of opinion leadership. The details of the design and verification of the model are presented. METHODS: The agent-based model was developed by using a software development platform to translate an underlying conceptual model of opinion leadership into a computer model. Individual agent attributes (for example, motives and credibility) and behaviors (seeking or providing an opinion) were specified as variables in the model in the context of a fictitious patient care unit. The verification process was designed to test whether or not the agent-based model was capable of reproducing the conditions of the preliminary conceptual model. The verification methods included iterative programmatic testing ('debugging') and exploratory analysis of simulated data obtained from execution of the model. The simulation tests included a parameter sweep, in which the model input variables were adjusted systematically followed by an individual time series experiment. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of model output for the 288 possible simulation scenarios in the parameter sweep revealed that the agent-based model was performing, consistent with the posited relationships in the underlying model. Nurse opinion leaders act on the strength of their beliefs and as a result, become an opinion resource for their uncertain colleagues, depending on their perceived credibility. Over time, some nurses consistently act as this type of resource and have the potential to emerge as opinion leaders in a context where uncertainty exists. CONCLUSIONS: The development and testing of agent-based models is an iterative process. The opinion leader model presented here provides a basic structure for continued model development, ongoing verification, and the establishment of validation procedures, including empirical data collection.

%X BACKGROUND: Telephonic disease management has been used to improve chronic disease outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Published reviews on such programs for diabetes have been mixed. Diabetes affects the poor and members of ethnic/racial minorities at a higher rate than other groups. Disease management, with its emphasis on self management, adherence, screening, and frequent contact outside the medical setting would seem to be ideally suited to improve outcomes for such patients. To test this hypothesis we designed a nurseled telephonic diabetes disease management intervention in a Community Health Center. This program, unlike most others, was implemented within the health center, using health center staff directly connected through an electronic health record to the primary care team. METHODS: Managing the Space Between Visits was a randomized, controlled trial of a telephonic disease management intervention. All patients had type 2 diabetes and most were Hispanic or African American, urban-dwelling, with low socio-economic status. Nearly all had Medicaid or were uninsured. Patients were randomized to receive calls from specially trained, bilingual nurses between once per week and once per month, depending on severity of illness, or to usual care. Calls focused on self management goal setting and problemsolving. Nurses could intervene as they saw fit to assist patients in any way possible. Telephone contacts were documented in the electronic health record and communicated to front line staff. Clinical measures included glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid levels, and body mass index. Validated surveys were used to measure dietary habits and physical activity. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were randomized to the intervention and 149 to the control group. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in both groups. Using an intention to treat analysis there were no significant differences in the primary outcome (HbA1c) between the intervention and control groups at 12 months. Surveys showed a high degree of acceptance of and satisfaction with the intervention. There were no significant differences for secondary clinical or behavioral outcome measures including BMI, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, smoking, or intake of fruits and vegetables, or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: A clinic-based telephonic disease management support program for underserved patients with diabetes did not improve clinical or behavioral outcomes at one year as compared to usual care. Challenges included high rates of depression, difficulty reaching patients, and a strong “usual care” platform for patients with diabetes. While self management has been shown to improve outcomes for diabetes, most healthcare providers are ill equipped to provide self management training, and many patients with diabetes fail to engage with such programs. Often the most poorly controlled patients lead the most chaotic, unstructured lives, limiting their ability to participate in highly structured interventions. Telephonic interventions provide a higher degree of convenience and acceptability to patients as well as being more scalable than the face to face programs. However this intervention did not produce demonstrable improvements in outcomes, adding to recent literature questioning the benefits of telephonic disease management. Further research is needed to develop new strategies to assist underserved patients with diabetes self management.(Table presented).

%X Background and Hypothesis: This study aims to develop and promote an interprofessional process for communication and decision making that enables the separate and shared knowledge and skills of care providers to synergistically influence the patient care provided. This study also aims to develop and strengthen the well functioning team in patient care, especially in chronic case management. Many doctors are not referring appropriately and timely to the other team members, especially nurses/ care managers, dietitians whenever applicable. This sometimes may be due to a lack of awareness of the services or not too sure of the other team members's role in value adding towards patient care. Methods: A regular inter professional collaborative practice case discussion will be held once every 2 to 4 weeks. The 1-hour lunchtime case discussion will be attended by all doctors and nurses as well as respective team members, such as dietitian, psychologist, medical social worker, acupuncturist, pharmacist, financial counsellor whenever applicable. The clinic key trainer will plan a duty roster and assign the topic for discussion for each session. The trainer will facilitate each session. The rostered doctor will present the case and the rest of team member(s) will contribute their parts on the patient's management. Results: After each discussion, the facilitator will enter into the electronic notes of the patient the learning points and recommendations concluded from the team discussion. Discussion and Conclusion: This process has established clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities held by each team member, a platform for regular communication, mutual trust, support and respect, and appreciation of the team members' contributions. Feedbacks from the participants had been very positive and encouraging.

%X Background Ageing has become a worldwide reality and presents new challenges for the health care system. Research has shown that the prescription of potentially inappropriate medications is highly prevalent in older people, especially in the nursing home setting. The use of potentially inappropriate medications is associated with adverse drug events, hospitalizations, mortality and healthcare costs. Purpose The Come-On study aims to evaluate the effect of a complex, multifaceted intervention, including multidisciplinary case conferences, on the appropriateness of use of medicines for older people in Belgian nursing homes. Method A multicentre cluster controlled trial has been set up in 60 Belgian nursing homes (29 intervention; 31 control). In each of these nursing homes, 35 residents will be selected for participation. Three-monthly multidisciplinary case conferences between nurse, general practitioner and pharmacist will be conducted on a resident-level. Case conferences will facilitate a structured medication review in order to optimize the resident's medication profile. Education and training, both through e-learning and on-site sessions, will be provided to participating health care professionals. Furthermore, local concertation will be held on the level of the nursing home to discuss and generate consensus on the appropriate use of two specific medication classes, and stimulate collaboration. As primary outcome the number of potentially inappropriate medications and potentially prescription omissions per resident will be compared between groups. Secondary outcomes will relate to process and outcomes of case conferences, cost, facilitators and barriers for implementation of the intervention. Findings The study protocol, based on input from a pilot study performed in four nursing homes, has been approved by the Ethical Committee of UZ Leuven and by the Privacy Commission. The content for the e-learning platform and on-site trainings has been built, and a web application to support multidisciplinary case conferences and data collection has been developed. Patient recruitment started in November 2015; data collection will start from January 2015 onwards. Conclusion This abstracts describes the protocol for a multicentre cluster controlled trial that will be conducted in 60 nursing homes in Belgium from January 2015 onwards.

%X Background: Specialist palliative care nurses have considerable expertise in pain management and this expertise can contribute to tension in the boundary between specialist nurses and non-specialist doctors. Objectives: This article reports on how specialist palliative care nurses contribute to team talk about pain and the rhetorical strategies they use to develop their reputation and credibility in pain management. Design and settings: This is an ethnographic study involving the collection of naturally occurring data from eight palliative care team meetings. The study is concerned with team meetings in hospice, community and hospital palliative care settings. Methods: Data was collected by audio recording eight team meetings in hospice, hospital and community palliative care settings. The data were analysed using a grounded theory approach followed by application of the tools of discourse and conversation analysis. Results: The findings indicate that specialist palliative care nurses use rhetorical strategies such as contrastive rhetoric, telling atrocity stories, veiled criticism and neutralism as a platform for building a reputation in managing pain. Furthermore they situate their expertise in pain management by direct contrast with problems related to non-specialist practice in pain management. Conclusions: The team meetings are a safe place, a collegial setting for specialist nurses to challenge non-specialist medical practice and to manage the specialist/non-specialist boundary. The findings have implications for further research related to the specialist nurse/non-specialist doctor boundary and for education of specialist nurses and GPs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The 2013 Lancet series on maternal and child nutrition is identified and advocated for improved institutional and human capacity in nutrition towards scaling up nutrition (SUN) in countries with high stunting rates. Of the fifty-four countries with high burden of child undernutrition who have committed to the SUN movement, thirty-six are in Africa. In the present paper, the academic platform of the SUN movement in Ghana presents an overview of nutrition pre-service capacity in West Africa with a focus on Ghana. The present paper is based on the findings of a sub-region-wide assessment of degree programmes in nutrition in West Africa, plus another report on pre-service nutrition capacity in diploma awarding nursing and nutrition programmes in Ghana. Although there is inadequate evidence on pre-service nutrition training in the sub-region, the two reports provide useful evidence for action, including inadequate number and distribution of pre-service nutrition training programmes, low nutrition graduate output, poor quality of the programme curriculum and instruction, and sub-optimal capital investment. The present paper calls for urgent action to improve pre-service nutrition capacity building as a critical step towards SUN in West Africa.

%X This project to help new nurse recruits integrate into the hospital work environment had two components: the development of a new web-based orientation tool in French for new recruits and mentor training for more experienced nurses. The aim of the first component was to redesign delivery of the nursing orientation program by assessing individual needs of new recruits and developing "just in time" information sessions with online access and e-learning modules. The second component aimed to develop a voluntary mentorship training program for senior nurses that offered training on the role and responsibility of mentors. A total of 30 orientation modules were created as resources that could be adapted to the needs of each nursing unit and accessed online. Sixty nurse recruits used the programs. A mentor training program was developed, and 28 nurses were trained as mentors. The mentorship literature and guides, produced in French, will be a valuable resource for francophone nurses across Canada.

%X INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of serious game computer simulation training in teaching electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) interpretation skills and the clinical action decisions associated with each abnormality. The use of novel technology like virtual reality, e-learning, and serious gaming can offer improvement in the learning outcomes. METHODS: OB/GYN nurses and physicians were randomized to either in-lab simulation group or serious game group in Phase 1 and received group-specific education on EFM interpretation and decisionmaking. After a minimum 3-month decay period participants completed Phase 2, a well-established in-situ team training drill in which they had to interpret EFM tracings and manage the patient accordingly. Participants were scored on their interpretations and decisionmaking of the EFM tracings during the in-situ team training drill. Participant scores were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Survey results were analyzed with the Chi square test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The primary outcome was percent correct in EFM strip interpretation and decision-making recorded during the in-situ team training sessions. In comparing overall performance between the groups, the serious game participants scored 55.8% and the simulation lab participants scored 61.6%. There were no significant differences detected (p = 0.43), however this study was under powered. CONCLUSION: The use of serious games in delivery of education to healthcare providers is a viable alternative to delivery of education in large simulation laboratories. Our serious game participants performed similarly to our in-lab simulation participants. Studies with larger numbers of participation are needed.

%X STATEMENT: The aims of this systematic integrative review were to identify evidence for the use of patient simulation teaching methods in pharmacotherapy education and to explore related learning outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted using 6 databases as follows: CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, ERIC, MEDIC, and the Cochrane Library, using the key words relating to patient simulation and pharmacotherapy. The methodological quality of each study was evaluated. Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The earliest article was published in 2005. The selected research articles were subjected to qualitative content analysis. Patient simulation has been used in pharmacotherapy education for preregistration nursing, dental, medical, and pharmacy students and for the continuing education of nurses. Learning outcomes reported were summarized as follows: (1) commitment to pharmacotherapy learning, (2) development of pharmacotherapy evaluation skills, (3) improvement in pharmacotherapy application skills, and (4) knowledge and understanding of pharmacotherapy. To develop effective teaching methods and ensure health care professionals' competence in medication management, further research is needed to determine the educational and clinical effectiveness of simulation teaching methods.

%X The World Heart Foundation International Symposium for Cardiac Care, is a series of training conferences to improve capacity for cardiac care and cardiac surgery in Vietnam and other Asian countries. The series is broadcast in live interactive format to nine sites, and worldwide through a simultaneous webcast. In December 2008 the program was accepted as a “Clinton Global Initiative” and praised by former President Clinton during a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in Hong Kong as a model health program “which should be replicated” across the world. The International Symposium for Cardiac Care is a regional program that links surgeons and doctors involved in cardiac care in developing countries with the world's best in cardio-thoracic surgery, cardiology, ICU nursing and pediatric cardiac care during three concurrent series of symposia. It allows doctors from all over Vietnam to congregate in teleconferencing centers in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Danang, and Hue for a series of lectures by exemplary leaders in the field of cardio-thoracic surgery. The lectures are interactive, enabling participants to ask questions after the presentation. Learning centers in Indonesia, Cambodia, China, and Bangladesh are also connected interactively. The series is also broadcast simultaneously via webcast and is available to groups and individuals anywhere where there is a good DSL connection. The sessions are also recorded and are being compiled into a DVD learning series and to be distributed to surgical programs and medical libraries in developing countries around the world. Our hope is that exposure at the World Congress and Global Forum will enable many more sights to join into the current webcast and forge connections that would help us replicate the interactive series in other areas of the world.

%X National guidelines inform us that all patients suspected of having a stroke should have their swallow screened within 4 hours of admission. The Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) service on a London Hyperacute Stroke Unit (HASU) has competing demands of clinical work and staff training, which can result in delays for new staff nurses accessing swallow screen training. Creation of an eModule to replace face to face teaching aims to increase timely access to training and provide a flexible system of self-directed learning for nursing staff. A joint project is currently being undertaken by the HASU SLT and Education Technology Department. Content of face to face classroom teaching has been shared with the Elearning Designer for transformation into an eModule via storyboarding and infographics. When launched, the eModule will be accessed by new Staff Nurses via the Trust's learning portal. Results will be available by December 2015 following completion of the project. Analysis of successful implementation will include measuring time from new staff nurses commencing their role on the HASU to accessing swallow screen training, collecting numbers of new staff nurses accessing the eModule independent of SLT time and gathering staff feedback on the experience of using the eModule.

%X Background: The Clinical Transplantation Program consists in a process performed by a multidisciplinary team working with common staff training, programs, protocols, and quality management systems. Peripheral blood stem cells represent the most used source of hematopoietic cells and apheresis is a routinely technique applied to collect them. In Italy the PBSC collection is generally performed by National Transfusion Services while the mobilization and reinfusion of stem cells is carried out by Clinical Units. For this reasons it is difficult to assure a continuity of patients assistance, especially from nurse's point of view. GIIMA's Aim is to promote the unique pathway in stem cell mobilization and apheresis by creating the stabile link between apheresis nurses who works in Transfusion Centers and those who operates In Transplant Centers. We developed the website (www.giima.eu) for information and educational material sharing with particular observation on Jacie's and Italian law regulation. Methods: GIIMA, in collaboration with SIdEM, has realized in 2012 the first national course for apheresis nurses. It was developed in five days, three Saturdays of frontal lessons respectively on: Productive Apheresis, Therapeutical Apheresis, Regulation and Quality and two days of preceptorship through the course adherent hospitals in Lombardy. Results: With more than 80 participant from all over the Country, GIIMA has realized the first national course in Apheresis for nurses, hopefully to be repeated next year. The Questionnaire we distributed confirms the rising interest of nurses for more dedicated courses. Conclusions: In 2013 we are planning to elaborate, besides the new edition of the previous course, also a distance e-learning course with the possibility of CME accreditation.

%X Introduction: FACT-JACIE International Standards Accreditation, Version 5 requires that the Clinical Program has access to personnel who are formally trained, experienced and competent in the management of patients receiving cellular therapy.Core competencies are specified within the standards and evidence of training in these competencies must be documented. This may be achieved by evidence of in service training, attendance at conferences etc. While initial supervised training is easily documented,annual competency maintenance can be difficult to show. Ongoing training for clinical personnel should reflect their experience, individual competencies and proficiencies, orientation for new staff and necessary preceptorships as such, training needs to be flexible to reflect staff requirements. Training also needs to be done in a timely manner to demonstrate annual updating. We wanted to devise a system in order to facilitate both appropriate and timely demonstration of continuing competency within our transplant unit. Method: Using the FACT JACIE standards as a basis we developed online test system on sharepoint platform using one question from each of the standards with multiple-choice answers. The questions were based on in house Standard Operating Procedures, and included conditioning regimen selection, CD34 target, management of side effects, palliative care etc. (Table 1) Results: 20 and 20 doctors completed the questionnaire. All participants reported that the test was easy to use and convenient. All questionnaires were completed on time with the possibility of repeating the test for those who had errors. Nurses had 100% correct answers whilst five physicians needed to repeat the test (25%) because of errors (1 with 4 errors, 3 with 2 errors, and 1 with 1 error). Where errors were observed, specific training was given to cover areas of concern. With repeated testing of staff after further training, participants all scored 100%at the second attempt. All staff had an annual update. (Table presented) Conclusion: The online testing system meant that both physicians and nurses could complete the test at a time convenient to them, and the results of the test could be collated and reviewed for to identify any education needs arising. This is an instrument that is easily modifiable so that future annual updates/tests can be devised reflecting other areas of practice and updates in the clinical area.

%X Background: Visual impairment broadly impacts the ability of affected people to maintain their function and to remain independent during their daily occupations as they grow older. Visual impairment affects survival of older patients, quality of life, can affect a person’s self-ranking of health, may be associated with social and functional decline, use of community support services, depression, falls, nursing home placement, and increased mortality. It has been hypothesized that senile cataract may serve as a marker for generalised tissue aging, since structural changes occurring in the proteins of the lens during cataract formation are similar to those which occur elsewhere as part of the aging process. The published analysis revealed a strong age-dependent relationship between undergoing cataract surgery and subsequent mortality. Methods: Nuclear opacity, particularly severe nuclear opacity, and mixed opacities with nuclear were significant predictors of mortality independent of body mass index, comorbid conditions, smoking, age, race, and sex. The lens opacity status is considered as an independent predictor of 2-year mortality, an association that could not be explained by potential confounders. Telomeres have become important biomarkers for aging as well as for oxidative stress-related disease. The lens epithelium is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress. Oxidative damage to the cuboidal epithelial cells on the anterior surface of the lens mediated by reactive oxygen species and phospholipid hydroperoxides can precede and contribute to human lens cataract formation. The erosion and shortening of telomeres in human lens epithelial cells in the lack of telomerase activity has been recognized as a primary cause of premature lens senescence phenotype that trigger human cataractogenesis. In this study we aimed to be focused on research defining the mechanisms that underlie linkages among telomere attrition in human lens epithelial cells associated with oxidative stress, biology of the lens response to oxidative damages, aging and health, cataract versus neuroendocrine regulation and disease. The cumulative results demonstrate that carnosine, released ophthalmically from the patented 1% Nacetylcarnosine prodrug lubricant eye drops, at physiological concentration might remarkably reduce the rate of telomere shortening in the lens cells subjected to oxidative stress in the lack of efficient antioxidant lens protection. Carnosine promotes the protection of normal cells from acquiring phenotypic characteristics of cellular senescence. The data of visual functions (visual acuity, glare sensitivity) in older adult subjects and older subjects with cataract treated with 1% N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops showed significant improvement as compared, by contrast with the control group which showed generally no improvement in visual functions, with no difference from baseline in visual acuity and glare sensitivity readings. Results: N-acetylcarnosine derived from the lubricant eye drops may be transported into the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) histamine neurons and gradually hydrolyzed. The resulting L-histidine may subsequently be converted into histamine, which could be responsible for the effects of carnosine on neurotransmission and hormone-like antiaging and anti-cataract physiological function. Conclusion: The research utilizing the N-acetylcarnosine lubricant eye drops powerful therapeutic platform provides the findings related to the intraocular uptake exposure sources as well as a timing dosage and duration systemic absorption of said preparation from the conjunctional sac reaching the hypothalamus with activities transfer into the hypothalamic-neuroendocrine pathways affecting across the hypothalamus metabolic pathway the telomere biology and cataract disease occurrence, reversal and prevention and the average expected lifespan of an individual. Such findings can be translated into clinical practice and may provide a basis for personalized cataract disease and aging prevention and treatment ppr aches.

%X Introduction: The clinical vignette is a well established and widely used educational approach for health professionals.1 In Italy, the National Drug Agency (AIFA) developed ECCE (Evidence Centered Continuing Education, http://www.aifa.progettoecce.it), a distancelearning tool founded on evidence-based reviews, clinical vignettes, and related multiple-choice questionnaires (more than 300 topics about daily clinical practice). At present, cumulative registrations amount to 150,614 health professionals (doctors, nurses) who performed 5,012,034 courses. A total of 4,709,666 CME credits has been awarded. The aimof our study was to evaluate effectiveness and satisfaction of toxicological clinical cases and to compare them with those in other medical fields. Methods: Five clinical reviews and eight vignettes were written on mushroom poisonings, antidepressant treatments in pregnancy and lactation, biguanide lactic acidosis, carbon monoxide poisoning and corrosives ingestion. Results: Health professionals faced 52,999 courses in clinical toxicology and performed significantly better than in the other fields (first attempt success rate: 77,9% vs 69,0%). Health professionals expressed a positive judgement about toxicological arguments, particularly in terms of relevance of the contents, educational quality, and effectiveness. Conclusions: ECCE project is one the most widely used learning project worldwide. The results show how high are the learning needs and expectations in medical toxicology and suggest the opportunity for disseminating e-learning projects in Europe and North America.

%X Background: Currently in the United States, there are an estimated 3.5 million breast cancer survivors (BCS), of which up to 75% in treatment and 35% after treatment report cognitive changes. To increase awareness of cognitive changes after treatment and promote healthy living to address those changes among BCS, Think Well: Healthy Living to Improve Cognitive Function (TW) was developed. The TW curriculum was evidencebased in knowledge of cognitive changes and potential compounding effects of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e., poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and inadequate sleep hygiene), as well as complex issues occurring with return to work. The resulting TW program addressed cognitive health, cognitive changes after treatment, healthy living strategies to promote cognitive function (i.e., nutrition, physical activity, stress management, and sleep), brain exercises (i.e., crossword puzzles, problem solving, and learning new activities), and compensatory strategies (i.e., using a planner, setting reminders, and note taking). Through the use of community engagement, the TW program was delivered over a two year period (2014-2016) in community settings throughout North Central Alabama. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of disseminating a web-based TW. Methods: A web-based TW was developed from the existing evidence-based TW program consisting of: 1) cognitive changes after treatment; 2) healthy living strategies to promote cognitive function; 3) brain exercises; and 4) compensatory strategies. Delivery of the web-based TW was via the website (www.ThinkWell.tips) and employed: 1) videos; 3) downloadable tip sheets; 4) events calendar; and 4) links to other websites for additional resources. The website was launched October 15, 2015. Website use was measured via Google Analytics for the time period of October 15, 2015 - June 20, 2016. Results: Google Analytics revealed 1,546 sessions, 1,177 users, and 2,224 page views for the designated time period as well global users (i.e., United States, Russia, United Kingdom, China, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Canada, and Brazil). The most visited pages included cognitive changes, nutrition, tip sheets, and events. Discussions/Conclusions: Results demonstrated that dissemination of a web-based TW was feasible and may have a global impact. To improve awareness of the TW website, future dissemination methods include distribution of business cards at professional/community events and engaging existing partners to disseminate via social media. Further TW website enhancements include a cognitive health blog and links to healthy living mobile applications and cognitive training platforms.

%X Objective: To review the outcomes of the first Middle East camp for Parkinson's disease (PD), Movement Disorders and Neuromodulation and its implications in the region. Background: Middle East and the Arabian world includes numerous developing countries with an estimated population of over 400 million. The prevalence of PD in the region is believed to be similar to the prevalence reported worldwide. The fields of PD and Movement Disorders are however underdeveloped and underserved in the region. While the characteristics of the disease and the needs of these patients are potentially comparable between the Middle East and other regions of the world, significant barriers to achieving optimal care for PD and Movement Disorders exist in these developing nations. Methods: The first Middle East camp was held in Dubai on April 12-13, 2014 to create a dialogue between all regional stakeholders from researchers, clinician, private practitioners and industry; thus delivering evidence-base education in the field of PD and Movement Disorders for the 1st time. The meeting lasted for two days and covered all major educational themes with special emphasis on up- todate discussion regarding medical and surgical management for PD as well as other Movement Disorders. Results: Over one hundred and fifty participants attended the meeting from over 25 countries. Diversity in audience was noted; neurologists, nurse-specialist, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, researchers and academicians were in attendance. Educational sessions were provided by distinguished faculty members from seven different countries. The meeting achieved its goal by providing upto- date discussion in the field to a very underserved region. It helped to bridge group of experts from the region to collaborate and characterize various unmet educational, clinical and research needs with in the field. This initial breakthrough meeting has yielded to the 2nd Middle East camp scheduled for April 2-4, 2015 in Amman, Jordan. Conclusions: There is a clear need to optimize the care of PD in the Middle East and Arabian world. The first Middle East camp provided a platform to initiate a structured educational process to deliver teaching and provide skills for the treatment of PD and Movement Disorders in this underserved region.

%X Objective: The Commonwealth of Nations is a unique congregation of 53 countries providing a platform for realistic collaboration on several social and health care issues. Ethical migration of health professionals from developing to developed countries is a key priority of the Commonwealth and several ethical codes have been put into practice. However, these codes have been mainly developed in regard to the medical workforce (physicians and nurses), and can have some limitations when applied to the dental profession. The aim of this study was to understand the role of the Commonwealth in influencing ethical migration of dentists from developing to developed countries, by examining the case of Indian-trained dentists migrating to Australia. Methods: The research design involved interviewing key health care or oral health leaders in India and Australia. A semi-structured interview process was designed. Grounded theory techniques were used in data collection and analysis. Findings: Both the Indian and Australian participants expressed serious doubts on the Commonwealth or any of its Associations in influencing ethical migration of Indian trained dentists to Australia. Three reasons emerged: indifferent priorities, lack of funds and the rise of other international organisations. Bilateral cooperation between concerned countries was considered as a feasible alternative. Conclusion: The role of the Commonwealth as a custodian of dental migratory ethics is limited. Further research is required as to how bilateral cooperation between India and Australia could be improved. There is also an urgent need for targeted funding allocations in oral health, especially in the form of international aid for research and development both in India and Australia. © 2011 FDI World Dental Federation.

%X The subject of advanced nursing practice has become a topic of great interest and considerable debate in recent years. It has as a concept, however, been increasingly obscured by the plethora of terms used to denote its particular role and function. The purpose of this paper is to suggest how a consensus may be achieved in terms of role clarification, educational preparation, intellectual skill, level of performance and remuneration. Fundamental elements of the current debate are seen to be the need for advanced nursing practice, how it will be recognized in practice, the parameters of the expanding role and the centrality of the patient rather than professional boundaries in delineating advanced nursing practice for critical care. The debate will no doubt continue. It is not the aim of this paper to reach a definitive understanding, but to provide a platform so that essential elements can be confronted and the development of the role carefully considered.

%X Program/Project Purpose: In this Abstract we describe the outcomes surrounding emergency nursing clinical practice in Kumasi, Ghana, five years after the implementation of an emergency nursing education program. The burden of injury in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is increasing rapidly, pointing to the need for skilled health care workers to manage this serious public health threat. Nurses represent the largest health workforce in sSA. While providing effective emergency and trauma nursing care is a significant challenge due to limited human and infrastructure resources, strengthening the provision of health services, including the nursing workforce, represents a step forward in addressing this burden. A modern Accident and Emergency Center opened in Kumasi, Ghana in 2009, along with an emergency nursing education pilot program. The goal of this pilot program was twofold: 1) to create a cadre of highly trained emergency nurses that could provide direct clinical care and 2) to develop a sustainable education program using low-resource technology that could be easily replicated at a low cost. Structure/Method/Design: All training materials including curriculum, lecture materials, and examinations are in place, and shared between stakeholders. An exchange program has been implemented where Ghanaian emergency nurses selected as future preceptors train in the United States for a period of one month each year. Key stakeholders are the University of Michigan School of Nursing and Department of Emergency Medicine, the Komfo Anyoke Teaching Hospital and the Kwame Nkrumah University for Science and Technology. Together this pilot program evolved from a conceptualized six-week training program to a two-year fully accredited Bachelor's of Science in Emergency Nursing. Didactic lectures delivered by visiting faculty, skills based laboratory sessions, patient simulation and mentored clinical experience encompass the formal education. Key to the long-term success of this program is the plan for sustainability. The program is based on a modified train-the-trainers model to replace external faculty with internally trained KATH nursing leaders as the program is developed. Outcomes & Evaluation: We present our findings through qualitative interviews with graduates of the program, physicians, and hospital administrators. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis were teamwork, confidence, challenges with existing systems and eagerness to advance. Going Forward: Going forward, a high quality program ensuring the advancement of emergency nursing practice that will help develop the specialty within Ghana is currently in place. Thirty-six nurses have graduated from the program and another twenty-six are currently enrolled. Six nurses have completed an intensive immersion in emergency nursing practice and teaching in the United States. Graduates of the program are serving as leaders in the developing specialty of emergency care in Africa.

%X Background and Aims: At the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), a policy named “Pain management” states that all health care professionals are accountable for pain management. To train nursing staff, a pilot e-learning program on pain management was created. Methods: Different entities were involved with the training construction: clinical staff of Traumatology wards, Continuing education department and pain project manager. Pilot training consists of 17 short videos of about 5 minutes each deposited on an e-learning platform. An identical questionnaire is filled in before and after each video in order to test gain knowledge at pre-post viewing. The program is available during 21/2 months from inside and outside hospital. Staff can train during their shift. Topics were: definition, assessment, management of acute pain and specialized techniques. Teams' training participation is voluntary but strongly encouraged. Team leaders' and trainers' support is specially marked during the training's period. Results: 3 indicators demonstrate the pilot training's pertinence: high participation rate, increases in knowledge rates in pre- and post questionnaires, and a very positive satisfaction rate regarding the pilot training's format. Traumatology team leaders noticed a better pain anticipation and pain management assessment, as well as the development of a more elaborate professional positioning regarding pain and pain management. Conclusions: This program tested by the traumatology ward at CHUV was very successful. Supportive clinical leadership is a key element of program success. A long term evaluation of knowledge retention is being developed. The program is easily transferrable to other wards.

%X Objective: To systematically review the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions to improve gross motor capacity and performance outcomes in children aged 5 to 17 years with an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Design: Systematic review. Method: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Embase, PubMed and SPORT Discus were searched until July 2015. Studies had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (i) at least 50% of participants were ambulant children aged 5 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ABI; (ii) randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, cohort, case series, case-control or case studies; (iii) interventions aimed to improve gross motor capacity and performance; (iv) outcomes included gross motor capacity and performance and/or participation measures. All surgical and medical interventions, treatments focused on improving upper limb capacity and studies which reported impairments related to body structure outcomes were excluded. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Downs and Black (D&B) scale and research design was assessed using a graded levels of evidence system. Effects sizes were calculated for suitable quantitative analysis. Results: Two home-based studies investigated functional strength training (one RCT, n=20, evidence level 2b, D&B=16/32; one non-randomised self-control study, n=19, evidence level 4, D&B=15/32) and four studies evaluated the efficacy of virtual reality to improve gross motor outcomes either in the home (3) or clinic/school (1) including: one prepost study, n=50, evidence level 4, D&B=22/32; one non-concurrent, randomised multiple baseline single-subject design study, n=3, evidence level 4, D&B=15/32; one case series study, n=2, evidence level 4, D&B=15/32; one case study, n=1, evidence level 4, D&B=15/32. Participants were aged between 7 to 17 years. Three studies specifically focused on children with ABI while two studies included children with mixed diagnoses (ABI/CP). For all six studies, duration of intervention ranged from 1 to 12 weeks, frequency of sessions between 3 and 7 days/week and length of sessions lasting 30 minutes. Total dose of intervention ranged from 2.5 to 24 hours however, two studies did not report total dose. The largest effect sizes for the RCT investigating functional strength training were 1.29 (95% CI=0.28-2.19) and 1.08 (95% CI=0.10-1.97) for functional reach non-preferred and preferred hand outcomes, respectively. Conclusion: There is a paucity of evidence to support the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions to improve gross motor capacity and performance in children with an ABI. Weak study design and low methodological quality of included studies limits the generalisability of results to all children with an ABI.

%X The ability to think critically has become a crucial part of professional practice and education. SimCity, a popular computer simulation game, provides an opportunity to practice community assessment and interventions using a systems approach. SimCity is an interactive computer simulation game in which the player takes an active part in community planning. SimCity is supported on either a Windows 95/98 or a Macintosh platform and is available on CD-ROM at retail stores or at www.simcity.com. Students complete a tutorial and then apply a selected scenario in SimCity. Scenarios consist of hypothetical communities that have varying types and degrees of environmental problems, e.g., traffic, crime, nuclear meltdown, flooding, fire, and earthquakes. In problem solving with the simulated scenarios, students (a) identify systems and subsystems within the community that are critical factors impacting the environmental health of the community, (b) create changes in the systems and subsystems in an effort to solve the environmental health problem, and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions based on the game score, demographic and fiscal data, and amount of community support. Because the consequences of planned intervention are part of the simulation, nursing students are able to develop critical-thinking skills. The simulation provides essential content in community planning in an interesting and interactive format.

%X This article presents a challenge which we call "the humane gap in medicine" and also raises some ideas on how to meet this challenge. This is the gap between the capacities of biomedicine as a bureaucratic and scientific establishment and the medical needs and expectations of its beneficiaries. It is argued that successful medicine relies on two pillars. The first is the corpus of biomedical knowledge, while the other is knowing the patients within their bio-psycho-social life-world. Both the second pillar and the bridging of the two pillars are dependent on the Humanities. The humanities in medicine also provide healthcare professionals with means of support against devastating encounters with suffering, disability or the relentless pressures of academic careers and overwhelming physical labor. The humanities serve as a shared platform for all healthcare providers, diminishing traditional, and sometimes obstructive, boundaries such as those that may exist between doctors and nurses. We provide a list of possible benefits that the Humanities may bring to clinical practice and medical education. We conclude with some suggestions on how the humanities may be incorporated into medical education and implemented at the bedside. We suggest that art students attend anatomical labs; courses in medical humanities be opened for the benefit of all students, within the faculty of medicine and beyond. We encourage students from every faculty to undertake academic activities which will combine voluntary work with the sick with participatory observation in the tradition of cultural anthropology.

%X In conclusion, in order for virtual reality simulations to move from the R & D laboratory to the teaching classroom on a large scale basis, there are four conditions which must be met: faculty involvement, student cooperation, affordable equipment and administrative support. 1. Faculty must understand the advantages of using VR simulations and be committed to developing the procedures and teaching modules and evaluating their effectiveness. They must understand that the simulations are another teaching tool and not a substitute for the teacher. 2. Students must be guided in the use of VR simulations to develop the level of skill required. Students must be willing to accept new ways of learning and must be able to see their individual learning progress in skill development. 3. Equipment-Must be realistic, affordable, available and clearly demonstrate advantages over traditional methods of teaching. 4. Administrative Support-Initially the cost of instituting VR simulations may be more than using other traditional teaching tools, thus ongoing financial support is very important. I believe that the faculty of the Nursing Department at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh is showing the way in incorporating VR simulations into a traditional undergraduate nursing program and as a result they are changing forever the way we will prepare health professionals for the future.

%X The use of virtual environments for the provision of health-care is on the increase, and with each new development brings debates about their impact on care, nursing and nursing practice. Such environments offer opportunities for extending care and improvements in communication. Others believe these developments threaten aspects of nursing they hold sacrosanct. This paper explores the development of an assemblage of computer networks, databases, information systems, software programs and management systems that together work to manage health-care in Australia, namely casemix. We contend that spatial theories on network society show how this assemblage co-ordinates and operates to manage care. We discuss how this assemblage affects care and suggest that changes in organisation may be a part of the shift in how bodily organisation occurs more generally, but more specifically in health-care. We also suggest how nurses are enrolled in and by such networks, leading to transformation in nurses' practices. Finally, we argue that using spatial forms of analysis allows an interpretation of such assemblages that may account for their strengths and their shortcomings.

%X Introduction: Our burn rehabilitation (rehab) department introduced 10 new staff members in a 12 month period. Establishment of a framework for teaching concepts, complexities and specialties of burn rehab through an evidenced-based precepting program (EBPP) may ensure staff competency, decrease work place anxiety, reduce errors, and lessen staff resignations. The purpose of this project was to modify and implement an EBPP to establish an objective competency assessment method for rehab. Methods: In APR 2014 burn rehab Preceptor Coordinators (PC) met with leaders of the nursing EBPP to discuss applicability and implementation of the nursing program to the rehab department. Elements of existing nursing program were modified and applied to meet rehab competency objectives. Published nationally agreed-upon rehab core competencies (“Burn Rehabilitation Therapist Competency Tool”) were expanded to support identified site-specific competencies; detailed coaching plans were created. The rehab PC's were given 10 hrs a week of administrative time for program development. Results: Elements of the nursing EBPP that were adopted and/ or modified included: binders for preceptors and preceptees; a wound care test; weekly competency assessment tool; novice to expert evaluation tool; and the clinical coaching course. Specific burn rehab coaching plans were created (n=25): 10 rehab specialty equipment, 2 intensive care, 6 wound care, and 7 rehab-specific. A computerized platform for objective competency evaluation was adopted and checklists developed for the rehab-specific skills. Burn rehab knowledge assessment tests for each skill type are in development. As of SEPT 2014, 17/32 (53%) burn rehab staff have attended the clinical coaching course. A total of 350 hours have been invested thus far by the PCs. Conclusions: Incorporating applicable elements from an established EBPP from the burn nursing department to burn rehab has been successful for competency requirements. Expansion of the broad national burn rehab competencies into site-specific coaching plans provides detailed resources and objective performance goals. Efforts are underway to objectively evaluate the impact of such a program using staff satisfaction surveys, retention data, and a competency evaluation. This program is being adopted Burn Center-wide, to include respiratory therapy and operating room staff. Applicability of Research to Practice: An EBPP specific to burn rehab is essential for standardizing the unique competency requirements for this specialty. Such a program can be used in other burn rehab departments to improve transition of both novice and professional staff into the burn specialty, as well as support a burn certification program for rehab specialists.

%X Social media has been used globally as a key vehicle for communication. As members of an innovative profession, many nurses have embraced social media and are actively utilizing its potential to enhance practice and improve health. The ubiquity of the Internet provides social media with the potential to improve both access to health information and services and equity in health care. Thus there are a number of successful nurse-led initiatives. However, the open and democratising nature of social media creates a number of potential risks, both individual and organisational. This article considers the use of social media within nursing from a global perspective, including discussion of policy and guidance documents. The impact of social media on both healthcare consumers and nurses is reviewed, followed by discussion of selected risks associated with social media. To help nurses make the most of social media tools and avoid potential pitfalls, the article conclusion suggests implications appropriate for global level practice based on available published guidance.

%X Medical radiation protection is based on 3 pillars: Justification, Optimization, and Limitation. Optimization comprises radiation dose management. The goal is to present a comprehensive strategy for optimizing the use of ionizing radiation during fluoroscopic procedures. The hypothesis is that ionizing radiation is a resource used during fluoroscopic procedures and optimal use satisfies the medical purpose but avoids excess or unproductive exposure [1]. Proper planning of an interventional procedure together with skilled performance will ultimately lead to dose saving. In addition to inevitable patient exposure, an interventional radiologist (IR) performing the procedure is subjected to exposure as well. The level of staff exposure depends on parameters related to the patient and equipment. The main source of staff radiation exposure is the patient, and the level of exposure is directly proportional to the patient's size. Other important factors are the quality of equipment, experience of the operator, and complexity of the procedure. One of the well-recognized and measurable occupational risk factors is radiation-induced cataract. The previous annual limit for IR was 150 mSv, but it has recently been recommended to decrease to 20mSv. during angiographic procedures [2]. Recent studies have shown that for unprotected operators, the radiation dose to the lens may exceed the current threshold for tissue reactions after several years of work at typical reported interventional workloads [3]. IR cautiously plans each intervention and learn the medical history of the patient but usually do not consider the previous diagnostic or interventional procedures with possibly high radiation exposure. Prior to obtaining informed consent IRs explain to the patient the procedure and its possible complications in detail but rarely, if ever, mention the dangers of the radiation exposure or any alternatives. The described approach is part of our daily routine, which usually does not include specific case tailored means of dose management and patients as well as staff radiation protection. Skilled and experienced operators will perform the procedure in the shortest possible time with minimal complications, if any. In case these operators also master the angiography equipment and are skilled in dose management, the expected outcome will clearly be shorter fluoroscopy time, less DSA runs, and less exposure dose. State of the art angiography systems allow virtually unlimited fluoroscopy time, DSA, road mapping, cone-beam CT, and other options based on ionizing radiation. Optimization and intelligent use of these imaging options will eventually provide better imaging, improve performance, and reduce the dose as an added value. Interventional procedure planning has to incorporate dose management measures, as our goal is professional use of radiation, not an irrational fear or negligence. A good example of team work with unmet dose management needs is a so called “hybrid room.” Hybrid rooms in the cath labs and operating theaters are a challenge in radiation protection perspective and carry potential radiation hazard to the patient and mainly to the staff. There is a large number of mixed personnel including surgeons, IR's, anesthesiologists, nurses, and radiographers. The complex procedures require extensive expertise and awareness to each small detail. Careful mapping of the room interior design and radiation geometry depending on various C-arm angulations will allow safe movement of the staff members in the room and reduce to minimum unnecessary exposures. Unfortunately, only part of the staff involved can use protective shields. For example, the protective apparel is thinner on the back compared to the front and the personnel should move in the room as they “face” the C-arm. Preplanning of each staff duty member and intelligent management of the whole process will result in shorter procedure time and a resultant shorter fluoroscopy time, keeping to minimum only the necessary number of optimized DSA runs. Dose management and staff rot ction at such open space rooms have no real solution today. It is strongly recommended and in some countries obligatory to maintain the cumulative radiation doses in each and every patient's records. Currently, numerous software solutions are available and allow monitoring, conversion, and recording on the RIS the complete data on patient's radiation exposure. CIRSE in Europe and SIR in US endorse such actions [4]. It is also suggested to keep integrated recording of different dose metrics for all IR requiring fluoroscopy and to establish thresholds for review and follow-up. In Europe, the evaluation and recording of patient dose are part of the quality assurance programs. The future European Directive on basic safety standards [5] will comprise this requirement as one of the articles in the directive. Recent introduction and availability of medical simulators improve operator's skills in procedure performance. Virtual reality medical simulators provide realistic simulation and tactile sensations of disposable angiography equipment as well as simulation and display of real time “fluoroscopic” images with Cine, DSA and C-arm operation. They are efficient and safe tools in training fellows as they allow a rehearsal in complete virtual IR environment without radiation exposure or complications. Virtual reality simulators are expected to significantly reduce complication rates and radiation exposure of patients and personnel [6].

%X Background: Trauma resuscitations require the rapid formation of an ad hoc medical-surgical team that must perform efficiently but rarely interact outside of the trauma bay. Objectives: Assess effectiveness of the Trauma Team Training (T3) simulation-based educational intervention teaching non-technical (teamwork) skills using crisis resource management (CRM) principles in an in situ environment. Methods: Instruction was based upon principles of CRM adapted from the AHRQ's TeamSTEPPSTM course. Fifty-four volunteers (EM and trauma surgery attendings and fellows, residents, nurses, and technicians) participated in one of eight sessions over 4 months. Volunteers reviewed CRM educational materials prior to the simulations. Sessions were three-part: videotaped in situ simulationbased resuscitation, educational intervention including video review and debrief, followed by a second resuscitation with bedside debrief. Participants completed the TeamSTEPPSTM Teamwork Perception Questionnaire (T-TPQ). A blinded, trained rater using video review and the TEAMTM assessment tool assessed objective improvement in teamwork post-intervention. Aggregate and subgroup scores were compared pre/post intervention with two-tailed paired sample t-tests (SPSS). Results: Aggregate data showed significantly higher postintervention scores on T-TPQ and objective teamwork improvement utilizing the TEAMTM tool (all p values <0.05). The largest improvements (T-TPQ) were team structure (3.2, 95% CI 2.3-4.1) and mutual support (3.2, 95% CI 2.2-4.2); smallest was communication (1.5, 95% CI 0.4-2.6). Overall team performance rating improved (7.14 +/- 0.90 pre intervention vs. 8.20 +/- 0.84 post intervention on 1-10 scale, p=0.034). The majority of participants (87%) believed teamwork in trauma resuscitations would improve as a result of the educational intervention. Conclusion: We demonstrated both improved perception and objective measurement of teamwork skills among a multidisciplinary trauma resuscitation team using the T3 brief educational intervention focused on CRM principles and an in-situ simulation-based teaching platform. Post-intervention scores improved in all core elements.

%X Web 2.0, the second-generation of the World Wide Web, differs to earlier versions of Web development and design in that it facilitates more user-friendly, interactive information sharing and mechanisms for greater collaboration between users. Examples of Web 2.0 include Web-based communities, hosted services, social networking sites, video sharing sites, blogs, mashups, and wikis. Users are able to interact with others across the world or to add to or change website content. This paper examines examples of wiki use in the Australian mental health sector. A wiki can be described as an online collaborative and interactive database that can be easily edited by users. They are accessed via a standard Web browser which has an interface similar to traditional Web pages, thus do not require special application or software for the user. Although there is a paucity of literature describing wiki use in mental health, other industries have developed uses, including a repository of knowledge, a platform for collaborative writing, a project management tool, and an alternative to traditional Web pages or Intranets. This paper discusses the application of wikis in other industries and offers suggestions by way of examples of how this technology could be used in the mental health sector. © 2010 The Authors.

%X Program/Project Purpose: The World Health Organization estimates there are 59 million health care workers worldwide. Many of them have non-clinical responsibilities as managers and policy-makers, but lack opportunities to develop and showcase the necessary skills. Formal programs such as an MBA or MPH are often expensive and inaccessible, while informal recognition is difficult to validate to potential employers and donors. Taking inspiration from competency based credentialing in education, architecture, and other industries, at the Global Health Delivery Project at Harvard University (GHD) we are developing badges for healthcare delivery. Through our digital badges, we hope to formally acknowledge the skills of health care workers that are not always gained through traditional means and to provide a professional development roadmap for healthcare workers. Structure/Method/Design: GHD built and operates an open-access platform, GHD-online, with more 14,000 professionals from 182 countries learning, discussion and collaborating on key challenges in global health delivery. We have worked to research, develop, and test digital badges since early 2014. After an expert panel in 2013, our users discussioned key issues as managers in global health delivery. In response we are developing badges in management, public health, and public policy. Participants will be able to receive a “basic” badge after an online assessment and progress to “advanced” badges with additional assessments, coursework, and structured interviews. Badges will be made available for a range of healthcare providers including nurses, pharmacists and physicians. Initial testers and participants will be selected from members of GHDonline. With their feedback we will iterate on the design and content. We are partnering with employers and donors to ensure badges are valuable to recipients. We have assessed existing online courses and resources and have been conducting focus groups and interviews with healthcare providers to test badge components. We are currently prototyping a management and public policy badge to launch in spring/summer of 2015. Outcomes & Evaluation: Healthcare providers have had positive reactions to the concept of digital badging for health care delivery. There are many online resources related to the field of healthcare delivery available already that will be easier to navigate and be more valuable with the introduction of a badging or recognition system. Going Forward: We need to broaden awareness of badges among employers and donors in order to make them an accepted credentialing mechanismfor healthcare workers. Further work also requires evaluating the scalability of the badges, while taking into consideration the specifics of each country. Ultimately, we aimto pave the way for broader adoption of competency-based credentialing and education in global health.

%X A seminar for graduating bachelor of science in nursing students involving discussion of clinical problems was successfully offered online concurrently with their clinical placements, rather than as an in-class course after clinical experience. The author describes the model used to guide discussion, which used a WebCT platform. The Web-based seminar achieved all the objectives of the classroom course while allowing more timely consideration of the issues that students encountered in practice and more considered discussion by students.

%X In Canada there is a growing aging population, and at the same time the incidence of cancer is also increasing. Advance care planning is a process of reflection and communication to identify the values, wishes and beliefs of an individual's future healthcare plans, for if a time comes when they cannot speak for themselves. In British Columbia, the Ministry of Health announced Advance Care Planning as new legislation on September 1, 2011. The legislation allows for a process that may result in an Advance Directive and/or Representation Agreement. The BC Cancer Agency has implemented an Advance Care Planning education program for physicians, nurses and allied healthcare providers. Simultaneously the PRISM (Patient-Reported Information and Symptom Measurement) questionnaire was introduced which assesses multiple domains for all patients including their knowledge of advance care planning. The education program includes both a compulsory introductory eLearning module and an advanced module consisting of in-person facilitated group sessions on enhancing communication skills. Staff will evaluate their knowledge and skills discussing advance care planning with patients and families. Along with staff performance, patientreported outcomes will be analyzed. Through education our hope is to increase comfort and capacity to address advance care planning with patients and their families.

%X Objective: The quality of spirometry in primary care is far from optimal, usually 60% of recordings fulfil the ATS/ERS criteria for good quality measurements. Traditional personnel trainings need frequent repeating to improve the results. We proposed a website platform to provide quality and interpretation feedback training for family doctors and practice nurses. Methods: Six primary care doctors and nurses with no previous experience in spirometry were invited to participate. They were equipped with NLHEP feature spirometer and held an 8 hour training including the theory and hands-on-practice. Each team sent 10 spirometries of any indication weekly for reference pulmonary function testing (PFT) centre via website. Three of the doctor/nurse teams were randomly chosen for feedback learning, the remaining three were controls. Feedback teaching was provided by PFT centre commenting on performed measurements with advices how to improve. Results: During 12 months of project duration 3215 spirometric tests including 9656 flowvolume loops were evaluated. Conclusions: The main technical fault in spirometry performed in primary care was the lack of reproducibility of FEV1 and FVC. Elearning feedback intervention was successful to gain better quality by 10%. (Table Presented).

%X Aims and objectives. To detect problems when classifying pressure ulcers and to examine whether an e-learning program is able to increase the classification skills of qualified nurses and nursing students. Background. Both the distinction between pressure ulcer grades and the differentiation between moisture lesions is difficult. Misclassification and incorrect identification of the lesions results in inadequate preventive and therapeutic measures. Education and training are important for spreading evidence-based insights about this topic. Design. Repeated measure design, consisting of one pretest and three posttests. Methods. The experimental intervention consisted of a one-hour session during which the participants independently went over an e-learning program. The control intervention consisted of a one-hour lecture. Both interventions had the same learning contents. A convenience sample of 212 qualified nurses and 214 final-year nursing students was randomly assigned to an experimental-and a control group. Results. In the pretest, the classification skills were low. After the intervention, these skills improved significantly in both groups. The nursing students achieved better results when using the e-learning program. Among the qualified nurses, there was no difference between the learning methods. Although the classification skills decreased in the posttests, they did not drop under the level of the pretest. Conclusion. The actual classification system does not provide the necessary information about the severity of a pressure ulcer. The differential diagnosis between a moisture lesion was complicated. The classification skills of the qualified nurses and nursing students increased by both learning methods. Repetition remains, however, necessary. Relevance to clinical practice. Both instruction methods are adequate to acquire the knowledge about the differences between moisture lesions and pressure ulcers. E-learning allows studying in one's own time and place, and could therefore be very suitable for repetition of the training. How to organise this training could be a subject for further research. © 2008 The Authors.

%X Background: Hemophilia is a chronic bleeding disease and can interfere with daily performance of children. These children require continuous training to prevent bleeding. Since children nurses play an important role in the education of sick children and their self-efficacy and the increase use of educational computer games, the use of educational games for teaching self-efficacy to children with hemophilia can be effective. Therefore, we aimed to explore the impact of computer-based learning games on the self-efficacy of 8-12 year-old children with hemophilia. Methods: The present study is an experimental interventional study on 40 children with hemophilia aged 8-12 years old during 2014. Data collection tools were a standard self-efficacy questionnaire and patients’ demographic forms. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16. Results: Based on the findings of this study, the mean self-efficacy scores of the samples before, after and one month after intervention were 53.25, 60.95, 60.90 in the case group, and 50.45 and 55.2 in the control group before and one month after the intervention, respectively. The findings revealed that self-efficacy scores after and before the intervention differed significantly. Conclusion: Educational hemo-action games increased self-efficacy in 8-12 year-old children with hemophilia.

%X Background: NETS Victoria performs over 1000 retrievals per year. In order to perform safely and efficiently, it is vital that transport teams have sufficient knowledge, skills and attitudes relating to neonatal retrieval. There was a perceived need within NETS Victoria for further medical educational development. We aimed to identify these needs. Method: A literature review was performed to evaluate the evidence-base behind proposed educational methods including the introduction of innovative techniques such as e-learning and simulation into the service and a questionnaire designed. Multidisciplinary feedback about learning needs was sought using the key principles underlying educational development via this questionnaire. Results: 6/9 (66%) of fellows and 11/32 (34%) of nurses have returned questionnaires to date. Only 4/17 (24%) respondents felt their needs were met by the current programme. There were no domains in which staff felt that they had no experience. 10/17 (60%) regularly accessed current interhospital education. 13/17 (76%) were in favour of further developing education provision. Procedural training was a priority for targeted education. Staff rated teaching about equipment, procedure training and case reviews as most useful. Journal club, computer assisted learning and developing a formal transport course were deemed least useful. Conclusions: There is a need to develop further educational opportunities within NETS Victoria. In order to meet the learning needs of a multidisciplinary team, challenges include optimising orientation and clinical supervision of transport personnel, maximising regular non-transport activity by introducing e-learning portfolios and the provision of an education programme, all within the constraints of a busy transport service.

%X Getting the nursing position you want is a highly competitive endeavor in today's health care environment. Knowing how to market yourself can make the difference between being hired and being overlooked. Two crucial elements of a successful job search are resume writing and interviewing. The purpose of a resume is to pique the interest of the reader and secure a job interview. The interview then provides a platform for the candidate to highlight his or her achievements and convince the employer that he/she is the best choice for the position. Resume development and interviewing must be approached with skill and knowledge. A well-written resume followed by a well-executed interview gives the candidate a strong advantage in obtaining the position he/she wants.

%X Although virtual reality platforms, such as Second Life, have been used in academic settings for more than a decade, little is known about how students perceive or adapt to this technology. This article presents the results of a research study that examined the experiences and perceptions of graduate nursing students as they explored the educational applications of Second Life. The students created avatars, interacted with one another in the virtual world, explored healthcare and educational uses, and maintained a reflective blog (online journal) of their experiences. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze the reflective blogs, and four themes were identified: (1) mastering Second Life, (2) technological challenges, (3) social interaction, and (4) knowledge dissemination. The results support the use of virtual reality in education, as even novice graduate students were able to overcome initial challenges and learn to navigate within a virtual world.

%X The complexity of the evolving advanced practice nurse (APN) role demands new teaching strategies. Based on the challenges that clinicians face daily, we have developed a teaching-learning strategy that addresses five central issues: (a) learning to perceive or identify relevant clinical problems; (b) learning to address the limits of formalism by situating clinical problem solving according to the most relevant goals and intents; (c) learning to reason in transition about the particular clinical situation; (d) learning the ethical skill of problem engagement and interpersonal involvement; and (e) learning to take a stand as a responsible agent by making clinical judgments, acting on them, and advocating for the patient/family. Although these five central issues are typically excluded from classic academic approaches, they are addressed in the "Thinking-in-Action" approach. This teaching-learning strategy offers a different way of teaching clinical judgment that closely resembles the way in which expert nurses actually think and reason in patient situations as they unfold.

%X Introduction: Dysphagia is a common, potentially life-threatening problem that compromises quality of life. A collaborative project was set up between the CLAHRC for South Yorkshire and the Stroke Service at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals to tackle identified inconsistencies in the management of dysphagia. The aim was to enhance staff knowledge and skills by piloting an innovative approach to workplace-based e-learning. Each session comprised a needs analysis, e-learning programmes, practical skills about modifying fluids, and action planning to transfer learning into practice. Method: Twelve months (March 2010-February 2011) action research on a stroke rehabilitation ward, evaluating the training effect and resource use cost of the facilitated e-learning. The methods were a scoping review, baseline and follow-up observations of dysphagia management (16 and 18 hours respectively), four bespoke questionnaires with attitude (Colodny 2001) and knowledge scales; and the cost per working hour for the stroke service. Results: Only five of 32 participants (22 registered nurses, 10 health care assistants) reported attending any previous dysphagia training. The training effect was evident in statistically significant differences in attitudes and knowledge held by the same people, at two time points, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The most common changes in practice related to medicines management, thickening fluids and oral hygiene. The resource use cost was estimated at £2,688 for 108 hours training. Conclusion: All participants achieved Assistant Dysphagia Practitioner competence level. Key success factors were designating dysphagia as mandatory, job specific training and combining expert facilitation with relevant e-learning programmes. These factors are easily replicable.

%X Introduction.- Evidence is needed to improve patient outcomes in rehabilitation and clinical practice often lags behind research evidence. Knowledge translation involves both creating and applying knowledge, and several activities are necessary to change professional behavior in favor of evidence based practice (EBP). The aim of this study was to describe methods used to integrate EBP in clinical work at Sunnaas hospital 2003-2013. Materials and methods.- Three hundred and twelve health professionals (physicians, psychologists, PTs, OTs, nurses, social workers and speech pathologists). A strategy was used to academize all health-professional groups, establish international co-operation and combine clinic/university/research positions. EBP projects, Journal Clubs and inter-disciplinary teamwork were used to change clinical behavior. Competency groups consisting of clinicians and researchers have developed guidelines for specific topics. Results.- An increase from 3 PhD/1 Professor 2003 to 30 PhD/15 Professors 2013, 15% of employees have Master Degrees. Evidence-based recommendations have been implemented into clinical practice for cognitive rehabilitation, spasticity, urology, aphasia and drivers license assessment. New evidence-based methods are continually integrated in the clinic as for example mirror therapy, virtual reality, and robotics. Discussion.- Several activities and a strategic plan were needed to build an interdisciplinary research environment and to integrate EBP into clinical practice.

%X Objectives: Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, which can require adjustment of therapeutic treatment. The aim of the present study was to assess medication management quality by monitoring weight and renal clearance of elderly population living in one of the 584 nursing homes of the region, especially people with chronic renal failure. Methods: A retrospective professional practice assessment was conducted in early 2014 with voluntary nursing homes of the region. People of 75 years old or more and living in a nursing home for more than a year were included. Traceability of weight and renal clearance were collected in the resident's file. Results: 84 (14%) nursing homes participated in the study. In total, 3063 resident's files were included. The mean age of residents was 88 years and 75% had at least one measure of weight and serum creatinine in the past year. 80% of nursing homes had automatic calculation of renal clearance and it was recorded in the resident's file in 68% of cases. 22% of residents had chronic renal failure and their biological follow-up was respected according to French guidelines for half of them. Conclusion: Nursing homesencounter difficulties to collect and record their residents' data and to standardize their practices. To improve traceability of weight and renal clearance, a free e-learning training and an information leaflet are proposed to healthcare professionals. A second measure of data will be conducted in early 2017.

%X Open Learning has been offered by the University of Winchester since 1991 in a partnership with the publishing company Emap Healthcare. A new on-line module for Independent, Extended and Supplementary Nurse Prescribing was developed by Emap Healthcare to meet a Government initiative to develop the role of nurses. The on-line module was created because of the wide spread national requirement, the need to keep the learning material contemporary and to revise it easily as required. Fourteen students completed the course and this paper reports the preliminary evaluation of the first cohort. Two questionnaires were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and both the course management and the e-learning materials evaluations demonstrate the success of this first cohort. Various minor changes to the course management have subsequently been implemented following this analysis.

The program focused on orientation through skill-based learning, critical thinking, human factors engineering, and patient safety using simulated experiences for a wide variety of high-risk, low-frequency, as well as high-frequency, commonly occurring clinical events and situations. Structured evaluations demonstrated that simulation serves as a highly effective strategy for developing competency, confidence, and readiness for entry-into-practice. It strengthened assessment and clinical skills, and enhanced nurse residents' ability to apply critical thinking to simulated patient scenarios. The time and cost of orientation decreased while recent graduate nurse satisfaction with orientation was high.

%X Care of the elderly is gaining in importance as a social challenge. The symptoms of old age have changed. Critical illnesses have gradually turned into chronic diseases. Many residents of nursing homes suffer from multiple terminal illnesses, which progress in phases of deterioration. This tendency means that expertise in palliative care and palliative medicine is required to a great extent in nursing the elderly and that a culture of palliative care should be an integral part of “the processes and training schemes that make up the organization of nursing homes”. From 2005 to 2008 Hospice Austria initiated a team with cooperating partners that drew up a number of standards of quality for the integration of hospice and palliative care in nursing homes. These standards of quality include all relevant target groups (residents, relatives, the director of the home, nurses, physicians, volunteers, the pastors and the psycho-social professions) and describe the aims in the relevant dimensions (nursing, treatment, psycho-social aid, spiritual care). Gender, intercultural and inter-religious matters are important issues at stake. In 2009 the standards were confirmed on a federal level by the advisory council for Hospice and Palliative Care. The advisory council sees itself as an inevitable platform of Hospice Austria in cooperation with representatives of Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social Affairs, the Austrian Medical Association, The national organizations of the nursing homes, the GÖG/ÖBIG (Austrian Health Institute) and ÖGAM (Association of General Practitioners in Austria). The standards represent the basis of the gradual implementation and the development of hospice and palliative care in nursing homes. Hospice Austria has crafted a model of project organization, which has already been translated into action in 14 nursing homes and is going to be tested in another eight homes in the autumn of the year 2009.

%X BACKGROUND: In traditional didactic teaching, the learner has a passive role, digesting the knowledge presented by the teacher. Stimulating and active teaching processes may be better at instilling information than more pedestrian approaches. Games involving repetition, reinforcement, association and use of multiple senses have been proposed as part of experiential learning. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of educational games on the knowledge and clinical skill of mental health professionals compared to the effects of standard teaching approaches. SEARCH STRATEGY: We performed electronic searches of AMED (1998 - November 2005), British Nursing Index (November 2005), Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2005), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2005), CINAHL (November 2005) EMBASE (November 2005), Educational Resources Information Centre on CSA (1966 - November 2005), MEDLINE (November 2005), PsycINFO (November 2005). We also searched references of all selected articles and contacted authors of included trials for more information. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing any educational game aiming at increasing knowledge and/or skills with a standard educational approach for mental health professionals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. We analysed the individual person data using fixed effect Peto Odds Ratio (OR) calculated the 95% confidence intervals (CI). If appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was estimated. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences. MAIN RESULTS: We identified one trial (n=34) of an educational game for mental health nursing students of only a few hours follow up. For an outcome we arbitrarily defined ('no academically important improvement [a 10% improvement in scores]') those allocated to educational games fared considerably better than students in the standard education techniques group (OR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.27, NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). On average those in the games group scored six more points than the control students on a test of questions relevant to psychosis set to the standard of the mental health nursing curriculum of the day (WMD 6 CI 2.63 to 9.37). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current limited evidence suggests educational games could help mental health students gain more points in their tests, especially if they have left revision to the last minute. This salient study should be refined and repeated.

%X BACKGROUND: Learning in general can be been a passive process. This review is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of educational games as a teaching strategy in mental health professionals. METHODS: We searched for all relevant randomised control trials (RCT) that compared educational games as teaching strategies with other methods of learning using electronic and reference searching, and by contacting trial authors. Data were extracted from selected trials and, individual person data was analysed using fixed effect Peto Odds Ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). If appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was estimated. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences. RESULTS: We identified one trial (n = 34) of an educational game for mental health nursing students which followed up participants only over a few hours. For an outcome we arbitrarily defined ('no academically important improvement [a 10% improvement in scores]'), those allocated to educational games fared considerably better than students in the standard education techniques group (OR 0.06 CI 0.01 to 0.27, NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). On average those in the games group scored six more points than the control students on a test of questions relevant to psychosis set to the standard of the mental health nursing curriculum of the day (WMD 6 CI 2.63 to 9.37). CONCLUSION: Current limited evidence suggests educational games could help mental health students gain more points in their tests; however this interesting study should be refined and repeated.

%X Tobacco use is the largest cause of preventable deaths in Czech Republic (CZ) & Poland (PL) and quitting reduces risks for cancer and other diseases. Current tobacco smoking among adults is approximately 30%. Nurses can help smokers quit, but few receive education to do so. This project tested the feasibility of a web-based tobacco cessation educational program on increasing nurses' delivery of evidence-based interventions (i.e. 5As: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) in CZ and PL. Methods: After setting teams in CZ and PL, we adapted and translated e-learning country-specific materials including two 30-minute webcasts: 1) smoking cessation, 2) the importance of quitting smoking after a cancer diagnosis, and obtained ethics approval. Recruitment strategies included letters and phone calls to hospitals, and ads in journals and websites disseminating a link to access project information and baseline survey. After completing the survey nurses received an email with a link to the webcasts and web-resources. At 3-months, they received a link to the follow-up survey. Consistent intervention (always/usually using the 5As) was viewed as best practice. Results: 279 nurses in CZ and 145 in PL had evaluable pre- and post-data. At 3-months, nurses in both countries significantly improved consistency of Asking about smoking status, Advising to quit, and Assessing willingness to quit. Nurses in CZ (OR =1.85, 95% CI 1.26,2.71) and PL (OR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.27,3.30) were more likely to Assist in quit attempts. Nurses in PL were twice as likely to Arrange for follow-up (OR=2.15, 95% CI 1.33, 3.47). Conclusions: Similar to programs in the US and China, web-based educational programs were feasible and successful in improving nurses delivery of smoking cessation interventions in CZ and PL. A similar program is being tested in other Eastern Europe countries. Efforts to increase nurses' involvement in cessation intervention could lead to a significant decrease in tobacco-related cancers.

%X Background: Exercise training is commonly recommended for individuals with fibromyalgia. This review is one of a series of reviews about exercise training for people with fibromyalgia that will replace the "Exercise for treating fibromyalgia syndrome" review first published in 2002. Objectives: • To evaluate the benefits and harms of aerobic exercise training for adults with fibromyalgia To assess the following specific comparisons Aerobic versus control conditions (eg, treatment as usual, wait list control, physical activity as usual) Aerobic versus aerobic interventions (eg, running vs brisk walking) Aerobic versus non-exercise interventions (eg, medications, education)We did not assess specific comparisons involving aerobic exercise versus other exercise interventions (eg, resistance exercise, aquatic exercise, flexibility exercise, mixed exercise). Other systematic reviews have examined or will examine these comparisons (Bidonde 2014; Busch 2013). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Thesis and Dissertation Abstracts, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry up to June 2016, unrestricted by language, and we reviewed the reference lists of retrieved trials to identify potentially relevant trials. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia that compared aerobic training interventions (dynamic physical activity that increases breathing and heart rate to submaximal levels for a prolonged period) versus no exercise or another intervention. Major outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQL), pain intensity, stiffness, fatigue, physical function, withdrawals, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed a risk of bias assessment, and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for major outcomes using the GRADE approach. We used a 15% threshold for calculation of clinically relevant differences between groups. Main results: We included 13 RCTs (839 people). Studies were at risk of selection, performance, and detection bias (owing to lack of blinding for self-reported outcomes) and had low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We prioritized the findings when aerobic exercise was compared with no exercise control and present them fully here. Eight trials (with 456 participants) provided low-quality evidence for pain intensity, fatigue, stiffness, and physical function; and moderate-quality evidence for withdrawals and HRQL at completion of the intervention (6 to 24 weeks). With the exception of withdrawals and adverse events, major outcome measures were self-reported and were expressed on a 0 to 100 scale (lower values are best, negative mean differences (MDs)/standardized mean differences (SMDs) indicate improvement). Effects for aerobic exercise versus control were as follows: HRQL: mean 56.08; five studies; N = 372; MD -7.89, 95% CI -13.23 to -2.55; absolute improvement of 8% (3% to 13%) and relative improvement of 15% (5% to 24%); pain intensity: mean 65.31; six studies; N = 351; MD -11.06, 95% CI -18.34 to -3.77; absolute improvement of 11% (95% CI 4% to 18%) and relative improvement of 18% (7% to 30%); stiffness: mean 69; one study; N = 143; MD -7.96, 95% CI -14.95 to -0.97; absolute difference in improvement of 8% (1% to 15%) and relative change in improvement of 11.4% (21.4% to 1.4%); physical function: mean 38.32; three studies; N = 246; MD -10.16, 95% CI -15.39 to -4.94; absolute change in improvement of 10% (15% to 5%) and relative change in improvement of 21.9% (33% to 11%); and fatigue: mean 68; three studies; N = 286; MD -6.48, 95% CI -14.33 to 1.38; absolute change in improvement of 6% (12% improvement to 0.3% worse) and relative change in improvement o 8% (16% improvement to 0.4% worse). Pooled analysis resulted in a risk ratio (RR) of moderate quality for withdrawals (17 per 100 and 20 per 100 in control and intervention groups, respectively; eight studies; N = 456; RR 1.25, 95%CI 0.89 to 1.77; absolute change of 5% more withdrawals with exercise (3% fewer to 12% more). Three trials provided low-quality evidence on long-term effects (24 to 208 weeks post intervention) and reported that benefits for pain and function persisted but did not for HRQL or fatigue. Withdrawals were similar, and investigators did not assess stiffness and adverse events. We are uncertain about the effects of one aerobic intervention versus another, as the evidence was of low to very low quality and was derived from single trials only, precluding meta-analyses. Similarly, we are uncertain of the effects of aerobic exercise over active controls (ie, education, three studies; stress management training, one study; medication, one study) owing to evidence of low to very low quality provided by single trials. Most studies did not measure adverse events; thus we are uncertain about the risk of adverse events associated with aerobic exercise. Authors' conclusions: When compared with control, moderate-quality evidence indicates that aerobic exercise probably improves HRQL and all-cause withdrawal, and low-quality evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may slightly decrease pain intensity, may slightly improve physical function, and may lead to little difference in fatigue and stiffness. Three of the reported outcomes reached clinical significance (HRQL, physical function, and pain). Long-term effects of aerobic exercise may include little or no difference in pain, physical function, and all-cause withdrawal, and we are uncertain about long-term effects on remaining outcomes. We downgraded the evidence owing to the small number of included trials and participants across trials, and because of issues related to unclear and high risks of bias (performance, selection, and detection biases). Aerobic exercise appears to be well tolerated (similar withdrawal rates across groups), although evidence on adverse events is scarce, so we are uncertain about its safety.

%X Allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation is still associated with morbidity and mortality and high level nursing care is essential for adult and paediatric patients. To increase knowledge of nursing practices and exchange (Table presented) information on transplantation specific topics a national network was established in March 2007.The Austrian BMT/SCT NG members represent 14 centres and the group is a sub-organization of AHOP (Austrian Working group of haemato-oncological nurses). It is also an active member of the EBMT nurses group.The primary aims are exchange of knowledge and distribution of standards for clinical care. Workshops are held twice a year.To identify the local standards of care a questionnaire on current practice in isolation, nutrition and hygiene measures was sent out. Twelve/14 centers responded and the results were evaluated in September 2008. It turned out that wide variation exists in isolation practice, infection prophylaxis, hygiene management and nutrition. Intensive and critical discussion on the different policies led to a restructuring of different nursing procedures. Old structures were challenged, adapted or partly exchanged.Willingness to reconsider our own position and looking over the rim of our tea cup will ensure high quality of care at a reasonable cost.

%X Background: City-wide re-organisation of stroke care in London, incorporating 8 hyperacute stroke units (HASUs), has improved thrombolysis rates and survival cost-effectively. Continued staffing of HASUs requires stroke-specialist training to develop competencies for managing neurological emergencies. Simulation training provides an education platform for health care professionals to become immersed in realistic scenarios where outcome is dependent upon technical and non-technical skills. Methods: A standardised, curriculum-mapped, high-fidelity, simulation-training programme was developed on 4 HASUs for city-wide staff to attend. Learning outcomes included technical (acute stroke assessment/management) and non-technical skills (including time management/decision-making/teamwork). A mixed-methods evaluation approach was used to evaluate data from participants before, during, and after training. Results: Over a 2 year period, 152 HASU staff (70 medical; 82 nursing) participated. Quantitative analysis showed a pre/post-course increase in candidates' ability to manage emergency stroke situations (t=6.6, p<0.001), leadership skills (t=6.7, p<0.001) and communication skills (t=3.7, p<0.001), more so in junior compared with senior clinicians. Simulation training was enjoyable (mean (SD) rating 5.7(2) on 7 point Likert scale), with higher ratings from doctors compared with nurses (t=3; p<0.01). Enjoyment correlated positively (r=0.853; p<0.001) and previous experience of simulation correlated negatively (r=-0.228; p<0.05) with relevance to clinical practice. Thematic analysis of post-course semi-structured interviews demonstrated 5 important learning outcomes (assertiveness; calling for help; situational awareness; teamwork; verbalising thoughts) and 3 main responses for transference to practice (general enthusiasm with no particular practical change; immediate recognition of an emergency situation providing recall of the course; reflective change). Conclusion: Simulation training may be effective in helping achieve HASU-specific learning outcomes and may be delivered in a standardised manner across multiple sites.

%X AIM: To identify factors that influence directors of nursing in their approach to leadership when working in rural Victoria, Australia. BACKGROUND: In rural areas, nurses account for the largest component of the health workforce and must be equipped with leadership knowledge and skills to lead reform at a service level. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive design was used. In-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with directors of nursing from rural Victoria. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and a thematic network was developed. RESULTS: Empowerment emerged as the highest order category in the thematic network. This was derived from three organising themes: influence, capital and contextual understanding and the respective basic themes: formal power, informal power, self-knowledge; information, support, resources; and situational factors, career trajectory, connectedness. CONCLUSION: Rural nurse leaders contend with several issues that influence their approach to leadership. This study provides a platform for further research to foster nurse leadership in rural healthcare services. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Acknowledgement of what influences the rural nurse leaders' approach to leadership may assist in the implementation of initiatives designed to develop leadership in a manner that is contextually sensitive.

%X BACKGROUND: It has previously been shown that nurses can learn clinical nursing skills by e-learning (online), and that many variables will influence how well nurses adopt learned clinical skills using distance education. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify and measure the strength of those factors which would simultaneously influence registered nurses' (RNs') beliefs about their own learning about buttonhole cannulation, using e-learning. DESIGN: An online Likert style survey consisting of a list of statements related to knowledge and skill domains considered crucial in the area of buttonhole cannulation was distributed to 101 RNs before and after completing an e-learning programme. Participants were required to identify their current level of self-confidence in relationship to each of the statements. MEASUREMENTS: Measures of RNs' self-rated abilities to assess and implement buttonhole cannulation after completing a related e-learning program were tested using a Partial Least Squares Analysis (PLS-PATH) programme. RESULTS: The study's results strongly identify that the nurses' ability to meet both clinical and educational outcomes of the renal e-learning module can be predicted by six variables, none of which are directly related to the participants' demographic or clinical backgrounds. CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of e-learning to teach clinical skills to RNs, and demonstrate the value of Partial Least Squares Analysis in determining influential learning factors.

%X Aims. This paper is a report of a three round Delphi study of intensive care nursing research priorities in Europe (October 2006-April 2009). Background. Internationally, priorities for research in intensive care nursing have received some attention focusing on healthcare interventions and patient needs. Studies as early as the 1980s identified priorities in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Australia. Research priorities of intensive care nurses across the European Union are unknown. Methods. The participants, invited in 2006, included 110 intensive care nurses, managers, educators and researchers from 20 European Critical Care Nursing Associations. Delphi round one was an emailed questionnaire inviting participants to list important areas for research. The list was content analysed and developed into an online questionnaire for rounds two and three. In round two, participants ranked the topics on a scale of 1-6 (not important to extremely important). Mean scores of round two were added to the questionnaire of round three and participants ranked the topics again. Results. There were 52 research topics in 12 domains. There was a dominance of priorities in five main areas: patient safety; impact of evidence based practice on outcomes; impact of workforce on outcomes; wellbeing of patients and relatives; and impact of end-of-life care on staff and practice. Conclusions. The results reflect worldwide healthcare concerns and objectives and highlight topics that nurses view as fundamental to the care of critically ill patients. These topics provide a platform for future research efforts to improve clinical practice and care of patients in intensive care. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Introduction A priority of The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) is improving intrapartum care, from process to outcomes. One mechanism is via the education programs ALARM (Advances in Labour and Risk Management) Canada and ALARM International. ALARM was developed by family physicians, obstetricians, midwives and nurses, who continue to maintain and teach. Courses are evidence-based, updated annually and incorporate practice guidelines. ALARM Canada is for high resource countries, offering case-based plenary sessions, hands-on workshops and a comprehensive examination process. E-learning will be a key platform for delivering ALARM in 2016. ALARM was adopted by the College of Family Physicians of Canada, providing common language and training platform. ALARM coexists with a longitudinal quality programme, MOREOB, but offers the important advantage of bringing practitioners together from different hospitals, enabling exchange of best practice between hospitals. The ALARM International Program (AIP) is a tool to reduce maternal death/injury in low resource countries. The 5-day program targets health professionals, reviews maternal killers and suggests tools to improve care for mothers/newborns. AIP was developed with an emphasis on sexual and reproductive rights; Discussions of women's reproductive and sexual health as an issue of social justice occur alongside hands-on clinical practice. By sensitising participants to social, economic, cultural, and legal factors that limit women's access to quality care, AIP promotes women's sexual and reproductive health in a comprehensive way. Results ALARM Canada has been presented all over Canada in the past 20 years; 8960 healthcare professionals have attended 251 ALARM courses and 15 Instructor courses. Over the past three years, 2444 healthcare professionals have attended the AIP Course. Data indicate that the course is useful and that quality of clinical practice will improve as a result. The AIP has been implemented across the world. Data show that hospital-based maternal mortality decreased by 15% in Mali and Senegal over a 2-year period; there was a decrease in deaths related to haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia and puerperal infection and a decrease in neonatal mortality before 24 h. An evaluation of the impact of AIP in Western Kenya also illustrated improved maternal outcomes. Conclusion The ALARM courese are powerful training programs for emergency obstetrical care training around the world. Implementation in other regions and countries, as well as standardised data collection, will continue to contribute to improved maternal, fetal outcomes and a strong foundation for obstetrical care. The ALARM Programs continue to evolve in ways that best meets the needs of partner countries and organisations.

%X High-fidelity patient simulation is a method of education increasingly utilised by educators of nursing to provide authentic learning experiences. Fidelity and authenticity, however, are not conceptually equivalent. Whilst fidelity is important when striving to replicate a life experience such as clinical practice, authenticity can be produced with low fidelity. A challenge for educators of undergraduate nursing is to ensure authentic representation of the clinical situation which is a core component for potential success. What is less clear is the relationship between fidelity and authenticity in the context of simulation based learning. Authenticity does not automatically follow fidelity and as a result, educators of nursing cannot assume that embracing the latest technology-based educational tools will in isolation provide a learning environment perceived authentic by the learner. As nursing education programmes increasingly adopt simulators that offer the possibility of representing authentic real world situations, there is an urgency to better articulate and understand the terms fidelity and authenticity. Without such understanding there is a real danger that simulation as a teaching and learning resource in nurse education will never reach its potential and be misunderstood, creating a potential barrier to learning. This paper examines current literature to promote discussion within nurse education, concluding that authenticity in the context of simulation-based learning is complex, relying on far more than engineered fidelity.

%X Purpose: To comply a decision aid tool with the criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), it is mandatory to follow a systematic and iterative approach to; (a) understand patient's and clinicians decisional needs, (b) create prototypical tools, (c) evaluate these prototypes with patients and clinicians and (d) use these results to improve the tool. We developed and validated a web-based decision aid (DA) for shared decision making in prostate cancer patients using this approach. Methods: A prototype of the tool was designed based on the input of an interdisciplinary group. Its clarity and acceptability was tested using a mixed method (interview and technology acceptance questionnaire; 5-Likert scale). The evaluation was performed with physicians (N=19) and patients (N= 16). Professionals from 5 academic and private hospitals (urologists, radiotherapists, specialized nurses and family doctors) gave their perspective about the patients' decisional needs and validated the information about the treatment options, complications and outcomes. The included patients were treated with either external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy or prostatectomy. Patients who choose not to be treated (active surveillance) were also included. The decisional needs were evaluated during an interview. Afterwards the patients' were guided through the DA and asked to fill in a questionnaire to check the comprehensibility of the tool. A second group of patients (N=8) was included to assess the e-learning effect of the DA and to check if patients were able to use the DA alone (without coaching). Results: The results were considered to create a new version of the DA. Physicians mentioned the need of information about basic anatomy, contraindications, hospital specific figures, and psychological support. Patients reported that the prototype of the DA provides clear information about the treatment options and their side-effects. Issues about the usability of the DA were reported and enabled us to improve and simplify the DA. The next step is to perform a study to establish the impact of the DA on the decisional conflict and the shared decision making process. Conclusion: The systematic and iterative approach used to develop and validate the DA, allows to follow a thoroughly development process, and to gain knowledge about decisional needs.

%X Background: High quality health care demands a nursing workforce with sound clinical skills. However, the clinical competency of newly qualified nurses continues to stimulate debate about the adequacy of current methods of clinical skills education and emphasises the need for innovative teaching strategies. Despite the increasing use of e-learning within nurse education, evidence to support its use for clinical skills teaching is limited and inconclusive. Objectives: This study tested whether nursing students could learn and retain the theory and skill of handwashing more effectively when taught using computer-assisted learning compared with conventional face-to-face methods. Design: The study employed a two group randomised controlled design. The intervention group used an interactive, multimedia, self-directed computer-assisted learning module. The control group was taught by an experienced lecturer in a clinical skills room. Data were collected over a 5-month period between October 2004 and February 2005. Knowledge was tested at four time points and handwashing skills were assessed twice. Setting and participants: Two-hundred and forty-two first year nursing students of mixed gender; age; educational background and first language studying at one British university were recruited to the study. Participant attrition increased during the study. Results: Knowledge scores increased significantly from baseline in both groups and no significant differences were detected between the scores of the two groups. Skill performance scores were similar in both groups at the 2-week follow-up with significant differences emerging at the 8-week follow-up in favour of the intervention group, however, this finding must be interpreted with caution in light of sample size and attrition rates. Conclusion: The computer-assisted learning module was an effective strategy for teaching both the theory and practice of handwashing to nursing students and in this study was found to be at least as effective as conventional face-to-face teaching methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Development of safe nursing practice in entry-level nursing students requires special consideration from nurse educators. The paucity of data supporting high-fidelity patient simulation effectiveness in this population informed the development of a quasi-experimental, quantitative study of the relationship between simulation and student self-confidence and clinical competence. Moreover, the study reports a novel approach to measuring self-confidence and competence of entry-level nursing students. Fifty-three baccalaureate students, enrolled in either a traditional or simulation-enhanced laboratory, participated during their first clinical rotation. Student self-confidence and faculty perception of student clinical competence were measured using selected scale items of the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric. The results indicated an overall improvement in self-confidence and competence across the semester, however, simulation did not significantly enhance these caring attributes. The study highlights the need for further examination of teaching strategies developed to promote the transfer of self-confidence and competence from the laboratory to the clinical setting.

%X An audit of the West African College of Surgeons' middle-level Diploma in Anaesthesia program was carried out to determine the current status of the diplomates. Using the West African College of Surgeons' database, social media and personal communications, the current status of Diploma in Anaesthesia graduates spanning 20 years was determined. A total of 303 (97%) out of 311 of graduates were traced. Eighty percent were still practising anaesthesia, while 5% were now in other disciplines. Two hundred and four (67.3%) still resided in West Africa (183 in Nigeria, 50 in Ghana, one in Sierra Leone), while 69 (22.7%) were abroad: 35 (11.5%) in the United Kingdom, 21 (6.9%) in the United States of America and four (1.3%) in Canada. More Ghanaian than Nigerian graduates had emigrated (41 vs 14%, respectively). Only 9% of diplomates remained in rural communities (as originally envisaged), while 31% were now consultants (as fellows) and 30% were registrars in fellowship training. These findings indicate that most diplomates moved on to acquire further qualifications and a significant proportion migrated. The program did not appear to have achieved the objectives of meeting rural middle-level manpower needs in anaesthesia as envisaged. It has, however, boosted the recruitment drive for residency training in anaesthesia. Perhaps a less migrant cadre such as nurses may better serve this function if recruited into a suitably designed training program in countries desiring to use middle-level manpower in anaesthesia.

%X Integration of virtual reality (VR) in clinical training programs is a novel tool in radiotherapy. This paper presents a review of the experience with VR and Immersive visualization in 3D perspective for planning and delivery of external radiotherapy. Planning and delivering radiation therapy is a complex process involving physicians, physicists, radiographers and radiation therapists/nurses (RTT's). The specialists must be able to understand spatial relationships in the patient anatomy. Although still in its infancy, VR tools have become available for radiotherapy training, enabling students to simulate and train clinical situations without interfering with the clinical workflow, and without the risk of making errors. Immersive tools like a 3D linear accelerator and 3D display of dose distributions have been integrated into training, together with IT-labs with clinical software. Training in a VR environment seems to be cost-effective for the clinic. Initial reports suggest that 3D display of dose distributions may improve treatment planning and decision making. Whether VR training qualifies the students better than conventional training is still unsettled, but the first results are encouraging. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X Context: High-quality cancer care should be accessible for patients and healthcare professionals. Involvement of patients as partners in guideline formation and consensus processes is still rarely found. EURECCA, short for European Registration of Cancer Care, is the platform to improve outcomes of cancer care by reducing variation in the diagnostic and treatment process. EURECCA acknowledges the important role of patients in implementation of consensus information in clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this article is to describe the process of involving patients in the consensus process and in developing the patient summary of the consensus for colon and rectal cancer care. Methods: The Delphi method for achieving consensus was used. Three online voting rounds and one tele-voting round were offered to an expert panel of oncology professionals and patient representatives. At four different stages, patients and/or patient representatives were involved in the process: (1) during the consensus process, (2) lecturing about the role of the patient, (3) development of the patient summary, and (4) testing the patient summary. Results: Representatives were invited to the voting and commenting rounds of this process and given an equal vote. Although patients were not consulted during the planning stages of this process, patient involvement increased following the panel's discussion of the implementation of the consensus among the patient population. After the consensus meeting, the patient summary was written by patient representatives, oncologists and nurses. A selection of proactive patients reviewed the draft patient summary; responses were positive and several patient-reported outcomes were added. Questionnaires to evaluate the use and implementation of the patient summary in daily practice are currently being developed and tested. Patient consultation will be needed in future planning for selection of topics. Discussion: The present study may function as a model for future consensus processes to involve patients at different stages and to implement both patient and healthcare professional versions in daily practice. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

%X OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning, implementation, and outcomes of an interprofessional education clinical laboratory facilitated through human patient simulation. DESIGN: An interprofessional education clinical laboratory was developed with a patient-care scenario of acute exacerbation of heart failure that incorporated the use of a high-fidelity patient simulator. Pharmacy and nursing students assumed clinical roles in this realistic scenario and collaborated to diagnose and treat the patient. ASSESSMENT: Student attitudes toward and readiness to participate in interprofessional education improved following participation in the laboratory. Students reported that the greatest benefit of the experience was in their communication skills. CONCLUSION: Students' ability to participate in interprofessional education experiences and their attitudes toward them improved following participation in this curricular initiative. Further evaluation of the impact of interprofessional education on student learning outcomes and changes in practice is warranted.

%X Background: Two obstacles to implementing effective interprofessional education are logistics (e.g., scheduling and space) and assessment. To overcome logistical obstacles, we developed a Virtual Case System (VCS) that provides a web-based platform for teams of students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and social work to collaborate around managing a geriatric patient. Using the VCS message board students communicate and raech consensus on team responses to geriatric-based questions. Team answers generate a total team score and, automatically collected metrics such as logins and message posts, track students' activity. Previously, we reported that activity measures positively correlate with team score. We now hypothesize that using Social Network Analysis (SNA), we can analyze message board activity to further define which team collaboration structures are correlated with better team performance. Methods: Using message board data from the fall of 2013, we built 42 networks of 322 students and calculated key metrics that quantitatively define team collaboration patterns, including: number of posts, average geodesic distance (average distance separating points in the network), subgroupings (the number of point clusters in the network), and modularity inverse (the degree of connectivity across subgroupings). We correlated these metrics with team score. Results: Team score is significantly correlated with number of posts, indicating that team performance is related to level of student participation (r = 0.44, p=.002); average geodesic distance (the opposite of closeness), suggesting teams whose members are more distant (i.e., less integrated and participate less broadly across discussion topics) are less effective (r = -0.28, p=.034); and modularity inverse, suggesting that teams which avoid cliquish behavior are more effective (r = 0.35, p=.011). Subgroupings were not associated with team score. Conclusions: Data from SNA added insights about the characteristics of successful teams during the VCS learning experience. Specifically, participation and integration predicted higher score while the number of subgroupings did not impact team score. These results can shape the evaluation of this and other interprofessional learning experience. In addition, applying SNA techniques to the clinical environment may delineate the most successful patterns of team collaboration.

%X Background: Optimal care requires interprofessional teamwork but logistical challenges limit shared in-person team training. Thus we created an interactive web-based platform for asynchronous collaborative education. Methods: We designed a virtual case system with a non-branching case design in 4 segments. Multiple-choice questions measure geriatric knowledge and decision-making. The case links all 26 AAMC geriatric competencies and crosses all major care settings. Each user receives case information that differs by specialty and, for best results, must share data with teammates within the system's electronic medical record. Individuals next answer questions individually; then teams answer the same questions jointly. Users can select multiple answers with each choice carrying positive or negative values based on appropriateness. To support students' work, the system offers resource links, a team roster with personal photo options, and a threaded dialogue box. Students also complete a 360-degree evaluation at the end of each segment. Administrators and educators have real-time access to learner data including logins, posts, and scores; the option to comment in the dialogue box; and ability to easily modify case content, questions, answers, point values, timelines, and users. Using Microsoft .NET, T-SQL and Adobe Flash software, the system registers users securely, sends data selectively to users, and captures user data in analyzable formats at the individual and group level. In August 2011, we initiated school-wide participation by senior VCU students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy and social-work. Results: With 20 teams per wave in waves lasting 6 weeks, 295 learners have successfully used the system. About 15% are out of town at any moment. Technical problems involved log-in and browser resolution, requiring limited support; most derived from user error. Preceptor time was about 1 hour per week, and student time was 5 to 10 hours per week when actively engaged. Learners averaged 12 case record contributions, 15 posts to the dialogue box, and 55 dialogue box views over the 6-week experience. Two students failed to complete their work and will repeat the assignment. More than 600 learners will complete the case by April 2013. Conclusions: This web-based case system is an effective tool for asynchronous IPE that overcomes logistical and cost barriers in this emerging instructional field.

%X The national nursing shortage, coupled with our country's financial challenges, provides a platform for creative nursing retention practices by health care organizations. It was from that platform that this research study was undertaken to determine if nurses who receive a high level of personal interest, education, and support through self-care workshops and one-on-one communication would continue their employment at the organization. The research question was "Will providing holistic self-care workshops during the first year of employment impact the nursing retention rates?" A total of 89 newly hired nurses were enrolled in the study, in which they participated in a 90-minute interactive workshop held weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. In the workshops, the nurses were guided to an understanding of the importance of self-care activities. The responses of the nurses who participated were positive. As a result of this study, the self-care workshops have continued with modification in length and the time when they were provided.

%X Bedside safety rails are used extensively throughout hospitals and residential care environments as a safety device to protect people against the risk of falling out of bed. However, several adverse incidents involving body entrapment have been linked to their use, which have resulted in serious injury to the bed occupants and, in more extreme cases, fatalities. Internationally agreed standards (i.e. European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) standards) for the design and testing of bed rails have recently been developed and are targeted at improved safety requirements (European Committee for Standardisation 1997,2000). The purpose of the present study was to: 1) determine whether the CEN test procedure for assessing bed rail strength and rigidity requirements is consistent with human force exertions to which bed rails may be exposed; 2) carry out loading tests on bed rails currently in use throughout the UK to determine whether they comply with the current safety recommendations proposed by the CEN standards. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the force exertions of 20 participants performing seven tasks (including activities of both bed occupants and care providers), which were considered representative of the forces to which bed rails could be exposed during normal use. Forces exerted by participants were measured using a force platform and distortions of the bed rails leading to potential entrapment zones were measured using linear displacement transducers. Static load tests were then conducted, in which incremental point loading was applied at the most adverse points on each of nine different bed rails (commonly used in UK nursing and residential care homes) in accordance with the test procedure detailed in the current CEN standards. Maximum static forces exerted by participants were found to range between 250 N and 350 N, which were within the 500 N force tolerance requirements set by the standards. Dynamic tasks involving 'rolling aggressively' against the bed rail produced the highest peak force of 722 N. None of the bed rails included in this study met the requirements of the CEN test procedures, principally due to horizontal lateral displacements being in excess of 50 mm for a 500 N applied force and/or the bed rails' inability to withstand inward horizontal forces of 500 N. Bed rails used with divan beds were often unable to withstand forces greater than 300 N due to turning moments exceeding the bed rail's restraining mechanism. Current CEN standards for assessing the strength and rigidity of bedside safety rails appear to be consistent with the human forces that might arise as a consequence of the normal movement and activities of a bed occupant or care provider. Although compliance with existing standards is not compulsory, findings from the tests carried out on the selection of bed rails in current use throughout the UK highlight the need for improvements in the design and manufacture of bed rails. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

%X Background: Otitis media (OM) is a leading cause of medical consultations, antibiotic prescription and surgery in children. The surgical procedures offered to children with recurrent or persistent OM are insertion of grommets, adenoidectomy or a combination of the two. There is clear National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for the use of grommets in subgroups of children with persistent OM with effusion (OME), but similar guidance is not available for adenoidectomy, either in persistent OME or in recurrent acute OM (AOM). Objectives: (1) To develop a model to predict the risk of children referred for adenoidectomy having a prolonged duration of their OM. Then, (2a) to evaluate the overall effect of adenoidectomy, with or without grommets, on OM using individual patient data (IPD) and (2b) to identify those subgroups of children who are most likely to benefit from adenoidectomy with or without grommets. Data sources: A number of electronic databases were searched from their inception including the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), metaRegister of Current Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalStudyResults.org and Google. Review methods: Studies eligible for inclusion in this IPD meta-analysis were randomised controlled trials in children up to 12 years of age diagnosed with recurrent AOM and/or persistent OME in which adenoidectomy (with or without grommets) was compared with non-surgical treatment or grommets alone. The final selection of eligible studies and the quality assessment were carried out according to standard methods and disagreement was resolved by discussion. Results: A total of 503 articles were identified of which 10 trials were included in the meta-analysis; eight of these were at a low risk of bias and two were at moderate risk. The primary outcome was failure at 12 months, defined by a set of persisting symptoms and signs. In the prognostic analysis 56% of those children referred for adenoidectomy (but randomised to the non-surgical group) failed to improve (38% of the children with recurrent AOM and 89% of the children with persistent OME). Children who had adenoidectomy had a greater chance of clinical improvement. The size of that effect is, in general, small but persists for at least 2 years. Two subgroups of children are most likely to benefit from adenoidectomy: first, children aged < 2 years with recurrent AOM - 16% of those who had adenoidectomy failed at 12 months whereas 27% of those who did not have adenoidectomy failed [rate difference (RD) 12%, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 6% to 18%; number needed to treat (NNT) = 9]; second, children aged ≥ 4 years with persistent OME - 51% of those who had adenoidectomy failed at 12 months whereas 70% of those who did not have adenoidectomy failed (RD 19%, 95% Cl 12% to 26%; NNT = 6). No significant benefit of adenoidectomy was found in children aged ≥ 2 years with recurrent AOM and children aged < 4 years with persistent OME. Limitations: The need to use a composite end point and the limited number of subgroup variables that could be studied are factors that reduce the robustness of these results; however, we do not believe that this reduces the validity of the conclusions. Conclusions: Adenoidectomy is most beneficial in children with persistent OME aged ≥ 4 years. A smaller beneficial effect was found in children with recurrent AOM aged < 2 years. Consideration must be given to the balance between benefits and harms. Future research is required in a number of key areas, including defining the best methods of selecting, developing and administering patient-reported outcome measures to assess the value of treatments for children with persistent OME and recurrent AOM and upper respiratory infections; investigating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hearing aids air or bone conduction) and the use of interventions to improve classroom acoustics for children with different degrees of persistence and severity of hearing loss associated with OME; and investigating why professionals' and parents'/carers' treatment preferences vary so much both nationally and internationally. We do not understand why adenoidectomy works in different subgroups at different ages, nor its effects in special populations, such as children with Down syndrome. We also need further research on the impact and optimal management of otitis media in these special situations and others, such as in children with a cleft palate or developmental problems. © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2014.

%X BACKGROUND: The use of social media platforms like Twitter within/for nursing education has become more common in recent years. Regardless, it is unclear how nursing students use technology like Twitter during the course of their nursing education. AIM: The aim of this paper was to explore how nursing students describe elements of their nursing education via the social media platform, Twitter. METHODS: Tweets about nursing courses, classes, and clinical were collected in October 2011 and analyzed for themes. Overall, 498 tweets were collected over a collective six day period, and 189 tweets were codified into five thematic representations. FINDINGS: Nursing students were found to discuss a variety of elements related to their nursing education, including events and situations they perceived to be positive or exciting. Stress and annoyance messaging was also noted as a salient theme expressed by nursing students when describing their education. Vulgarity and derogative messaging targeting elements of nursing education (including courses, students, and faculty) were found in a subset of tweets. The majority of the tweets collected in this study contained random discursive conversations regarding nursing education, including information seeking requests and declarative statements about temporal events. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study point to a need for educators to explore aspects surrounding eProfessionalism within nursing education. Similarly, this paper also highlights the growing requirement for nursing educators to learn more about how social media is being used by nursing students within/for their education, in order to better develop learning and networking opportunities for students. Without this, nursing education may miss a significant opportunity to help shape students' professional use of social media technology like Twitter.

%X In Sweden, regulations from the National Agency for Higher Education advocate an education that equips students with independence as well as critical, problem-based thinking, i.e. academic literacy skills. However, some research findings indicate that students may leave higher education without mastering these skills effectively. As part of quality-assuring a nursing programme at a university college in south-east Sweden we explored the nursing student's view of crucial academic literacy skills, such as critical thinking and appraisal and academic writing, by conducting a descriptive, qualitative study. Informants were recruited through an advertisement posted on the university's e-learning tool. Eight focused interviews were conducted during autumn 2010. The transcribed interviews were analysed - inspired by content analysis - and two categories became apparent: constantly questioning and formality before substance. The latter revealed a gap between the student's perception of academic writing and that of the educators, thus implying that nursing students might not be equipped with the tools they need to develop within academia. We suggest that students could benefit in their academic endeavours from theoretical educational models that integrate several academic skills simultaneously and which could be incorporated into the development of syllabuses and curriculums. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

%X AIM: To investigate public health nurses' perceptions and experiences of mental health and of the prevention of mental ill health among women postpartum, within paediatric healthcare services. BACKGROUND: Although maternal health following childbirth should be a priority within primary care, it is known that women postpartum do not always receive the support they need to adapt to and cope with motherhood. Research implies that postnatal problems lack recognition and are not always acknowledged in routine practice. Few studies have been presented on this topic or from the perspective of nurses. METHODS: For this study, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with public health nurses, and the transcribed texts were analysed through a process inspired by Burnard's description of the four-step qualitative content analysis. Findings Three categories - external influences on postpartum mental health, screening for and preventing postpartum mental ill health and paediatric healthcare services as a platform for support - were interpreted to reflect the nurses' perceptions and experiences of mental health among women postpartum and of the prevention of mental ill health among women postpartum. CONCLUSION: We found that public health nurses can have an important role in supporting mothers' mental health postpartum. Although caution is warranted in interpreting our results, the findings concur with those of other studies, highlighting that an equal care emphasis on both the mother and child can be an important aspect of successful support. Implementing person-centred care might be one strategy to create such an emphasis, while also promoting the mental health of new mothers. Public health nurses have a unique opportunity to support mothers' transition into healthy motherhood, especially because they are likely to meet both mothers and children on a regular basis during the first year after birth.

%X Mounting evidence support the occurrence of a “GAP” between the “real world care” and the “optimal care”of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The T.O.S.CA. Project is an Italian multicenter initiative aiming to explore the CHF “metabolic pathophysiological model” and to improve the quality of care of CHF. Research/Aims: a) To give reference values of the main anabolic axes from a large Italian CHF population; b) to evaluate whether anabolic deficiencies identify subgroups of CHF patients with worse clinical status, and cardiovascular performance; c) to evaluate whether deficiencies of the main anabolic axes affect heart failure progression and outcome; d) small case-control studies will address more specific topics such as the relation between direct assessment of myocardial ultrastructure and gene expression profile and the anbolic/catabolic balance in endomyocardial biopsies of HF patients; e) to evaluate the efficacy of multiple hormone replacement therapies. Education/Aims: To improve the quality of care of CHF patients (timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness) in different clinical settings. A specialized education continuing medical (E.C.M.) meta-model designed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team will be implemented. Care/Aims: To develop a structured CHF Management Program (CHFMP) in the area of the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy as a continuum between the community hospital and the territorial health system serving 110.000 inhabitants. The CHF out-patient clinic represents the platform of the Amalfi Coast CHFMP, directed by clinical cardiologist and coordinated by registered nurse, along with multidisciplinary team (Fig.1). Conclusions: The mission of the T.O.S.CA. project is to expand the bridge between research, education and care sharing best practices and resources in CHF. (Graph presented).

%X Background: The NRAS 2012 survey RA and the Impact on the Family highlighted that there was little or no support for people living with RA to help with issues on emotions, relationships and intimacy. 41% had difficulties in their close relationships as a direct result of RA and 67% said that their sex life had been negatively affected. However 32% felt that their partner's RA had brought them closer together. NRAS undertook as part of the conclusions and recommendations of this survey to research more imaginative ways to provide information and support on the topic of close relationships and is producing a booklet and online resource on RA and Relationships. A study in 2005 showed that while rheumatology nurses acknowledge the importance of including sexuality in the care management of patients with RA, in practice the impact of the condition on a patient's sexuality is only discussed briefly with nurses, identifying the need for further training in this complex arena. 83% of the nurse respondents had never received any training on this subject. A study in France in 2012 showed that while it is known that RA has a negative impact on patients' sexuality, there have been few attempts to quantify the problem. That study triggers the question how to include this topic into care. Methods: Independent health journalist, Kate Wilkinson and psychotherapeutic counsellor, Sarah Collins were commissioned to work with NRAS on this project. Initially a focus group on the topic of emotions and RA was attended by 8 patients and one spouse. Being independently facilitated allowed people to speak openly and anonymously. Subsequently 2 teleconference focus groups with 16 people explored in more depth the issues around sex and intimacy. Thirdly, an online questionnaire was hosted on the NRAS website and promoted via NRAS social media sites. This survey gave people the opportunity to share their experiences of how RA has impacted on personal relationships. The survey evaluation will help shape the structure of the booklet and the NRAS online resource. Real life stories captured via qualitative interviews form the sections of this new NRAS resource to be launched at BSR 2013. Results: A common issue identified at the 3 focus groups was that RA affects your sense of self-belief and self-esteem, and it's hard to feel sexy. All attendees felt being listened to matters even if nothing changes, being listened to is a relief, a connection, and you feel less lonely. Key messages were that the resource should make it clear that all feelings are OK; there is no magic recipe or standard way of dealing with RA; it is a personal and continual process of adjustment. Conclusions: This NRAS booklet and online resource will be an interactive tool for individuals and their health care professionals to assist the discussion of sensitive and difficult topics. Containing real-life experiences will help the user relate to the issue and find tangible ways to address problems that may arise in their relationships.

%X Need: Queensland Health's LMS has provided a functional technological interface that suits the individual abilities of nursing staff, predominantly in a cancer care setting. CIRCS facilitates two courses on the platform which are contributing to the development of sustainable levels of service in settings where face-to-face education is difficult to provide. Reach: Seventy percent of Queensland's land surface area is rural and remote, including 162 public health service facilities. The LMS has allowed CIRCS to expand its educational reach into these geographically restricted areas. So far, 652 nurses in 46 facilities in rural, regional, remote and metro Queensland have participated in these courses. CIRCS hopes to eventually reach 7,000 nurses and standardise the way cancer care is provided. Benefits: The LMS enables immediate and synchronous communication, content development and delivery, formative and summative assessment and data collection. CIRCS defined objectives and goals to align with Queensland Health policies and address the challenges magnified by geographical distance and unique community characteristics. The absolute reach into rural, regional and remote areas allowed priority goals to be achieved with acceptable quality and minimal resources. Approach: The nature of the LMS enables a fast and efficient response to changing trends and demands. The LMS is supplemented by education sessions using Telehealth. This enables CIRCS' Nurse Educator to video link with nurses in rural, regional and remote Queensland. This blended learning approach empowers the delivery of course content to most people in an efficient time. Conclusion: Queensland Health's LMS has enabled CIRCS to provide standardised education and resources to nurses who would otherwise be unable to attend face-to-face education sessions. This practice is helping to provide a highly-skilled, capable and sustainable workforce through flexible education delivery.

%X Background and Objective: Patients suffering from primary immunodeficiency diseases are treated with immunoglobulin (Ig) administered in two different ways: 1. intravenously in a medical setting 2. subcutaneously by the patient himself. As subcutaneous infusion is usually self-administrated at home, autonomy and quality of life of patients should be increased. However, patients need to be educated and supported over the long term by health care professionals to ensure proper adherence and allow optimal efficacy and safety. Our goal was to develop and implement a structured therapy management program, involving community pharmacists and nurses, for patients self-administering Ig therapy. Results: Program description: 1. Patient's skills to undertake subcutaneous Ig treatment are firstly assessed by pharmacists and nurses on predefined criteria. If possible, the program is initiated at the patient's home. 2. Patients follow a structured educative program scheduled from the first dose-where the administration is made by a nurse and a pharmacist-to the fourth dose-where the administration is made by the patient alone, followed by the pharmacist's call. 3. Periodically, administration under supervision (nurse and pharmacist) is performed for preventing “wrong habits” and answering questions. In addition, semi-structured motivational interviews are performed by pharmacists at refills (every three months). This program is standardized: e.g. documents describe educative sessions and information to be provided and collected by the pharmacists at each step; motivational interviews are based on predefined questionnaires (e.g. occurrence of technical problems or infections); indicators allowing to follow adherence, efficacy and safety are also included. Conclusions: We implemented a standardized and structured program aiming to ensure optimal therapy management for patients under self-infusion therapy. Initial support (i.e. educative program), is ensured by nurses and pharmacists; person-centered long-term support (i.e. adherence, efficacy, safety) is mainly undertaken by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians and nurses. Currently, three patients are actively involved in this program. The next steps are to develop a network of community pharmacies. In addition, a web platform, as a vector for interprofessional collaboration, will be implemented to facilitate a dynamic monitoring. Clinical results will be presented in the future.

%X Goal: Fingolimod is the first oral therapy approved in Switzerland for the first-line treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). However, its use is associated with a certain number of safety risks, and a systematic risk management strategy is recommended to prevent or minimize them. Our goal was to elaborate a person-centered and integrated care program for optimising safety and effectiveness of fingolimod in MS outpatients. Method: A specific clinical pathway for the responsible use of fingolimod was designed by combining clinical and safety data from the scientific literature as well as approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) from FDA and Swissmedic. The adherence enhancing program implemented was adapted from a standardised and evidence-based practice set up for many years in the Community Pharmacy of the PMU (Policlinique Médicale Universitaire) in Lausanne (Switzerland). A shared MS patient record was integrated in a secured web-platform (SISPha SA), which is considered as a vector for local interprofessional collaboration and for long-term monitoring of outcomes and safety indicators. Results: About 30 community pharmacies in the French part of Switzerland implemented the collaborative program in partnership with hospital and community-based neurologists. The key element is motivational interviewing led by trained community pharmacists, who coach MS patients for integrating fingolimod and co-treatments into their daily life. A medicine management guide reinforces the homogenous information for patients. Electronic pillboxes supply data reflecting medication schedules and bringing objective basis for discussing barriers and facilitators of adherence. Reports (adherence and safety) are transmitted to medical (neurologist, family doctor) and nurse team. The webplatform provides reminders and alarms to pharmacists (e.g. clinical parameters monitoring, refill prescription schedule), as well as data for research analysis. Conclusion: The experience gained in implementing a personcentered and collaborative management therapy allowed optimising the follow-up of MS fingolimod outpatients. The next step will observe the adoption rate of the new care model and evaluate its process and outcomes indicators.

%X BACKGROUND: The efficacy of locomotor rehabilitation studies has largely been based on clinical measures of gait speed and walking performance. Although critical, gait speed does not fully capture the multidimensional benefits associated with walking recovery. The International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) model of rehabilitation emphasizes the role of personal and environmental factors in affecting quality of life and personal health status and advocates a broad approach in the assessment and treatment of people with disabling conditions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe a multidimensional approach to outcome measurement reflecting the ICF model. SUBJECT: The participant was a 59-year-old man with C7 American Spinal Injury Association impairment D tetraplegia, 16 months after injury. INTERVENTION: The participant completed a 45-session, five days per week locomotor training program. Comprehensive evaluations were completed pre- and post-training targeting all elements of the ICF model. OUTCOMES: The participant achieved negligible increases in gait speed, but increased self-elected walking activity from 26 steps per day to 1273 steps per day. His assistive device changed from a platform to a rolling walker, representing a Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI) increase from 8/20 to 13/20. Qualitative interviews illustrated an attitudinal shift, leading to improved motivation, confidence, self-esteem, problem-solving, and increased activities/participation in the community. Ultimately, the participant was able to transition from nursing home placement to living independently. CONCLUSIONS: This case report emphasizes the need to move beyond traditional models for evaluation at the impairment and clinical level to examine the effects of interventions on independence, community integration, and quality of life.

%X A multimedia virtual patient module, involving the case of a young woman with mild intellectual disabilities with a complaint of diffuse abdominal pain, was developed as a clinical training tool for students in health care professions. Primary objectives following use of the module included improved knowledge and reduced perception of difficulty in treating women's health patients with intellectual disabilities. The module was developed using an iterative, collaborative process of a core development team that included medical professionals, multimedia specialists, the parent of a child with intellectual disability, and a disability advocate. Over the course of the module, students were required to identify appropriate and effective clinician-patient interactions in addition to relevant medical and developmental concerns for this patient population. Pilot data from a sample of nursing, physician assistant, and medical students suggest that the module is an effective tool for both improving students' knowledge and reducing their perception of difficulty in providing care to women's health patients with intellectual disabilities. © 2008 American College of Nurse-Midwives.

%X Pressure ulcers are a common complication of spinal cord injury (SCI). Pressure ulcer education programs for spinal cord injured individuals have been found to have a positive effect on care protocol adherence. A prospective study was conducted among hospitalized spinal cord-injured men and women to determine if viewing the Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Management Education for Adults with Spinal Cord Injury: E-Learning Program affects their knowledge scores. A 20-question multiple-choice pre-/post learning test was developed and validated by 12 rehabilitation nurses. Twenty (20) patients (13 men, seven women; mean age 49 years, [SD: 18.26] with injuries to the cervical [seven], thoracic [six], and lumbar [six] regions) volunteered. Most (42%) had completed high school and time since SCI ranged from 2 weeks to 27 years. Eighteen (18) participants completed both the pre- and post test. Of those, 16 showed improvement in pressure ulcer knowledge scores. The median scores improved from 65 (range 25 to 100) pre-program to 92.5 (range 75 to 100) post-program. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the data. The results suggest that a single viewing of this e-learning program could improve pressure ulcer knowledge of hospitalized adults with SCI. Research to ascertain the effects of this and other educational programs on pressure ulcer rates is needed.

%X OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Clinical research protocol development is complex, especially for inexperienced investigators. Structured supportive guidance through the process of protocol development can accelerate translational research. We report our 4 year experience with Research Protocol Navigation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We constructed a seven-step Research Protocol Navigation process consisting of concept initiation, concept refinement, biostatistics review, protocol draft ing, expert consultation, interdisciplinary input, and protocol finalization/submission. Specific goals and core educational elements relevant to clinical investigation and GCP were defined for each stage. Content experts from biostatistics, research pharmacy, research nursing, regulatory support, etc. contributed to protocol refinement. Protocol feasibility was assessed relative to recruitment, staffing, training, facilities, and finances. A structured electronic platform, configured to support protocol writing and GCP, was used throughout Navigation. Utilization and investigator and protocol demographics were collected. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Since 2008, 107 new studies (83 investigators) have undergone Navigation. In 2011, Navigation was provided for 24 new studies originating in 12 different laboratory groups, (half of which previously conducted T1 level research) involving 6 experienced investigators, 7 Clinical Scholar trainees and 11 investigators new to clinical research. Navigation was provided to support protocol amendments/renewals for previously navigated protocols (25 investigators; 32 protocols). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Navigation provides investigators coordinated access to expert input and CTSA resources designed support rapid development of a scientifically robust, ethical and feasible protocol. Navigation support is especially relevant for trainees, new investigators and basic scientists new to clinical translational research.

%X Hospital discharge planning in oncology is an important challenge in the continuum of care and services in order to improve the quality of care provided to cancer patients. Some authors highlight the importance of educating patients and their families, coordinating services, and implementing regular follow-ups as factors essential to planning the discharge. According to Ontario's (Canada) Excellent Care For All Strategy, “Reducing avoidable readmissions of patients discharged from hospital is an important area for improving the quality and safety of health care.” The strategy highlights the importance of using evidence-based findings to ensure better transitions in care and avoid hospital readmissions. Even though some studies have revealed benefits on patients' health when knowledge is used others have focused on the lack of impact on health due to problems disseminating and implementing clinical practice guidelines. These findings promoted the development of strategies for knowledge transfer (KT) to integrate knowledge in the renewal of clinical practices. This presentation will present the development of an interactive clinical innovation using Web technologies, the Knowledge Exchange Portal (KEP). The KEP is an interdisciplinary online platform that brings together researchers, nurses, doctors, other professionals, administrators, decision-makers and patient partners in a new space in order to share scientific and experiential knowledge as well as to improve care. It is used to promote KT and facilitate the rapid circulation of information between healthcare partners and the coordination of patient care and services in order to support the implementation and adoption of exemplary clinical practices. This presentation will highlights barriers and facilitators to the use of the Knowledge Exchange Portal.

%X This paper emphasises the tensions between the ideal of the compliant within care settings and the ideal of the critical thinker within the university setting with reference to student nurse education and identity. Identity is an important part of who we are as people. While modernisation and increased professionalisation of nursing have impacted on staff and patients mostly in a positive way, changes in the management of nursing education in the past 20. years have also heralded a remarkable change in the student identity. Historically informed by association with a particular hospital or health service provider, student nurse identity was shaped by institutional rituals and routine, physically embodied in objects such as uniforms and hospital medals and informed by claims to honesty, virtue and personal integrity (Bradby, 1990). Once part of the structure and fabric of hospital life, nursing students functioned as part of the health care service. As such, their identity was synonymous with that of practicing nurses, whose learning needs were secondary to that of the organisational needs. While this social milieu provided the platform for the formation of institutional pride, belonging and identity, such forms of identity can result in institutional compliance; with the associated risk of ritualistic practice, poor levels of transparent accountability and barriers to whistle blowing should substandard practice arise. Increased student freedom and an emphasis on teaching and learning within the university setting may have benefitted students, patients and the profession, however, the potential impact on student identity is less certain. There is evidence to suggest that students are ill-equipped for their professional identity once qualified and thus require more support for this within universities. This paper explores the tensions between traditional hospital identity and contemporary university identity with reference to student nurse education. The ideal of the compliant versus the ideal of the critical thinker will be debated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Aim. To explore the effect of size and strategy on asynchronous discussions (AD) in a small baccalaureate nursing program. Background. As the prevalence of e-learning increases in nursing education, the use of AD as a learning strategy will increase. Because the AD can be engaging, group size should be considered to enhance learning. Method. Descriptive, correlational, and quasi-experimental methodologies were used to gather and analyze data from 23 junior baccalaureate nursing students. Variables included differences in group size (12 versus 23) and strategy (Virtual Clinical Excursions® versus faculty-developed questions). ; Results. There was no statistically significant difference in student outcomes for group size or strategy. The data suggested that smaller group size would help students "dig deeper" into the content being explored. Conclusions. Student perception responses indicate that Virtual Clinical Excursions was more likely to prepare them for nursing and clinical practice. Future research should include larger sample sizes and more variety in the sample demographics.

%X Purpose: In response to the looming oncology manpower shortage, the Washington State Medical Oncology Society (Vancouver, WA) surveyed medical oncology practices in Washington regarding employment patterns for advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) and physician assistants (PAs) in oncology. Methods: Funded by a 2008 ASCO State Affiliate Grant and using Surveymonkey.com as a platform, practices were queried regarding practice demographics, employment patterns, and functions of ANPs and PAs. Results: Of the total queried, 25 practices (50%) responded, representing the spectrum of single-specialty (n = 8), multispecialty (n = 7), hospital-based (n = 6), and academic practices (n = 4). Sixty-eight percent of practices employed ANPs and/or PAs. Compared with PAs, ANPs were more likely to work independent of supervision (64% v 0%), perform follow-up in the outpatient setting (93% v 77%), evaluate patients in infusion centers (71% v 62%), and provide genetic counseling (42% v 0%). PAs were more likely to see hospitalized patients (62% v 42%) and supervise infusion centers (15% v 7%). New patient consultations were performed with similar frequency (PAs, 29% and ANPs, 31%). ANPs were more likely to review research eligibility (25% v 15%), obtain informed consent (33% v 15%), and monitor compliance (13% v 8%). Conclusion: Washington practices have embraced advanced practitioners. Given the diversity of practice patterns, practices can learn from one another how to maximize ANP/NP roles. Practices need to promote practice-based educational opportunities to attract ANPs/PAs to medical oncology. Copyright © 2010 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

%X Introduction: A key activity of the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority (The Authority) 2009 health reform was employing specialist donation staff (SDS) dedicated to improving organ and tissue donation processes in hospitals. Monash Health (MH) which is Victoria's largest health service has experienced a threefold increase in Organ donation since the implementation. Alternative methods of education delivery have eventuated to meet staff need. The paper reports on the development of an E Learning Portal to deliver interactive accessible education to staff. Methods: SDS utilised a strong knowledge base, and linked with an external IT consultant to place clinical knowledge in a usable interactive format. Four modules were proposed by the SDS. The first was the National Clinical (GIVE) trigger. This module was launched in February 2012.The GIVE Trigger is used in all Emergency Departments and Intensive Care units to identify potential donors. This was subsequently followed by the second module, Eye and Tissue donation, which was launched in October 2012. This module was designed for all medical and nursing staff. Results: 1000 MH staffs have completed the online modules. Organ and tissue donation recognition, approach and consent rates are at an all-time high for the organisation which can be partly attributed to an increased awareness and understanding formed from the E Learning portal. Conclusions: Due to the success of the E Learning Portal in MH, Donatelife Victoria has engaged with the SDS to launch both modules across Victoria and New South Wales.

%X The definition of eprofessionalism in the context of social media is a relatively unknown paradigm within healthcare. Whilst studies have focussed primarily on the use of social media by healthcare professionals, many have also concluded a desire or need for professional guidance. This need has been driven by concerns relating to fitness to practise and framed by cases where a registered healthcare student or professional has been subject to investigation due to their online behaviour. The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise, synthesise and present the available evidence on professional body and regulatory organisation guidance on the use of social media for registered healthcare professionals. A systematic review protocol was registered with the Centre for Review and Dissemination Prospero and conducted following the Prisma-P guidelines.1,2 Definitions of registered healthcare professionals from the Department of Health (2015) helped identify the population for the review which was limited to English speaking countries within date limits of 1 January 2010 -February 2016. The search used keys words relating to: registered healthcare professionals; guidance; social media; and e-professionalism - which were applied using Boolean operators in Medline, CINAHL, AMED, IPA, Sage, The Cochrane Library and Science Direct. Professional and regulatory guidance documents were searched using Google. Articles were reviewed independently by two members of the review team using an adapted existing tool. Quality assessment was applied to articles and guidance documents but this was not an exclusion criteria. Ethical approval was not required. Searches identified 32 guidance documents and 11 journal articles to include in the review. Of the 11 journal articles, two were identified as guidance documents. Geographically, the guidelines included were from English speaking countries Australia (n = 3), Canada (n = 6), USA (n = 5), UK (n = 11), New Zealand (n = 3), Ireland (n = 2), whilst 4 guidelines related to more than one geographical area: Australia/New Zealand (n = 1), global (n = 2) and Europe (n = 1). In total, 11 professional groups were represented in the guidance documents identified: Medicine (n = 13), Nursing and Midwifery (n = 8), Allied health professions (n = 5), Psychology (n = 1), Dentistry (n = 2), Pharmacy (n = 3), Social work (n = 1), and Chiropractors (n = 1). Overall, there was no common structure to the guidance and few clearly described their development, implementation or related evaluation. No clear or agreed definition of social media (SoMe) emerged. The majority of documents identified inappropriate behaviour rather than appropriate use of SoMe. Most related to fitness, practice or disciplinary procedures. None of the papers discussed guidance in detail, or evaluated the guidance, rather commented in the context of a wider discussion on social media use. Guidance documents provided information on social media with examples given of inappropriate behaviour and how to exercise caution when using social media. None of the guidance documents defined appropriate online behaviour despite 28 relating inappropriate use to a relevant code of conduct, potential fitness to practice or disciplinary procedures. A further phase of research is now planned exploring the definition of appropriate online behaviour and how this can be supported within the pharmacy profession.

%X Although mental health is the third highest reporter of medication incidents as reported by the National Patient Safety Agency,1 it is well known that there remains under-reporting of medication incidents particularly in community settings. Within Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust, medicines incidents were predominantly reported by inpatient nursing staff. Interventions made by pharmacists were not routinely captured on the trust's web-based incident reporting system, DATIX. AIMS: To improve reporting of medication incidents using pharmacist interventions and to improve learning and feedback thus improving patient safety. METHOD: Using an amended “pharmacy intervention” form, all interventions made by the pharmacists and technicians were reported through DATIX and analysed alongside medication errors. These were reviewed and reclassified by the chief pharmacist to medication incidents or improving quality of care. Medication incidents were recategorised as per NPSA classification. RESULTS: Medication incident reporting increased dramatically. The trust now has the second highest level of reports for a mental health trust with reporting by all staff groups in all areas. Changes to systems include a new medicines card, nurse competency assessment, non-registered practitioner training, reviewed in-house medical training and a medicines nurse. Feedback to ensure lessons are learnt is through locality incident scrutiny meetings, mandatory training, e-learning and newsletters. 50% of incidents are due to prescribing errors versus 12% for the equivalent NPSA cluster. Two one-day consultant training sessions highlighted these errors. The team can identify high risk medicines and practices (eg, insulin, sodium valproate, olanzapine, clozapine and methadone) and ensure changes to processes and systems support. The increased reporting has additionally allowed monitoring of pharmacy services, yellow card reporting, adherence to antibiotic policies, NPSA alerts and issue of lithium patient packs following on from the recent patient safety alert.2 The team won the 2010 Patient Safety Awards for a “system wide, sustainable change in practice that truly improves patient safety”. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Submitting pharmacy interventions has dramatically increased the levels of medication incidents reported. Analysing and learning from this has led to changes to training, practice and competency assessment systems. Improvements in practice such as protected medication time, incident learning forums, link nurses and learning boards on wards are now in place. The system is now used as a quality management system also to provide assurance for external validation of services such as by monitoring medicines reconciliation. By monitoring the implementation of NPSA alerts, for example, the trust can show it is improving patient safety.

%X Introduction: Our regional burn center serves a wide catchment area, which creates major challenges in follow-up care. In 2006, we implemented a store-and-forward protocol (“BurnPics”) for established patients to email photographs in order to verify healing and range of motion. Starting August 2014, we established an additional videoconferencing follow-up system for select patients. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate BurnPics and videoconferencing utilization over the past 12 months. Methods: We reviewed records of patients enrolled in the BurnPics program from August 2014 through July 2015, including patient and injury characteristics, state of residence, distance from a burn center, successful BurnPics use (defined by at least one photo received), and patient disposition after BurnPics. We also reviewed videoconference enrollment, utilization, provider time, and revenue generation. We analyzed all data using descriptive statistics. Results: There were 398 patients enrolled in BurnPics, with a median age of 29 (IQR 13-50) and median burn size of 2% (IQR 1-6) body surface area. Most patients resided instate (82%), followed by adjacent catchment states (7, 4, 3% respectively). Median distance from residence to burn center was 67 miles (IQR 29-228). Of 299 patients who sent at least one photo, 160 (54%) were subsequently followed on an as-needed basis, 52 (17%) also returned for in-person clinic visits, 49 (16%) also underwent videoconferencing visits, 21 (7%) were lost to follow-up, and 17 (6%) remain active in the program. In the past 12 months, 53 patients underwent 85 videoconferencing visits; 30 visits (35%) were billable and generated income, 27 visits (32%) were post-operative follow-ups, and 28 visits (33%) were not billable due to out-of-state residence. Median time spent per patient video-visit was 46 minutes (IQR 35-60), which includes set-up, nursing, provider and therapy time. Median time spent with burn care providers was 11 minutes (IQR 7-14). Conclusions: The BurnPics program mitigates the challenges of follow-up burn care in our region. This platform allows for patients to submit pictures, and selects individuals who require additional follow-up. Videoconferencing creates minimal additional time burden on providers, and allows timesavings for both patients and clinic workflow. Additional revenue from videoconferencing may justify providers pursuing inter-state licensing in the future as the volume of tele-visits grows. Applicability of Research to Practice: Use of both store-and-forward picture programs and videoconferencing visits may be useful for other burn centers in outpatient follow-up care.

%X Aim.: In this paper, we tested the over-arching hypothesis that progressive self-guided learning offers equivalent learning benefit vs. proficiency-based training while limiting the need to set proficiency standards. Background.: We have shown that self-guided learning is enhanced when students learn on simulators that progressively increase in fidelity during practice. Proficiency-based training, a current gold-standard training approach, requires achievement of a criterion score before students advance to the next learning level. Methods.: Baccalaureate nursing students (n = 15/group) practised intravenous catheterization using simulators that differed in fidelity (i.e. students' perceived realism). Data were collected in 2008. Proficiency-based students advanced from low- to mid- to high-fidelity after achieving a proficiency criterion at each level. Progressive students self-guided their progression from low- to mid- to high-fidelity. Yoked control students followed an experimenter-defined progressive practice schedule. Open-ended students moved freely between the simulators. One week after practice, blinded experts evaluated students' skill transfer on a standardized patient simulation. Group differences were examined using analyses of variance. Results.: Proficiency-based students scored highest on the high-fidelity post-test (effect size = 1·22). An interaction effect showed that the Progressive and Open-ended groups maintained their performance from post-test to transfer test, whereas the Proficiency-based and Yoked control groups experienced a significant decrease (P < 0·05). Surprisingly, most Open-ended students (73%) chose the progressive practice schedule. Conclusion.: Progressive training and proficiency-based training resulted in equivalent transfer test performance, suggesting that progressive students effectively self-guided when to transition between simulators. Students' preference for the progressive practice schedule indicates that educators should consider this sequence for simulation-based training. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Proficiency-based training, a current gold-standard training approach, requires achievement of a criterion score before students advance to the next learning level. We tested the hypothesis that progressive self-guided training offers equivalent learning benefit while limiting the need to set proficiency standards. Methodology: Nursing students (n = 15/group) practiced IV catheterization using 3 simulators that differed in fidelity (i.e. students' perceived realism). Proficiency-based students advanced from low- to mid- to high-fidelity after achieving a proficiency criterion at each level. Progressive students self-guided their progression from low- to mid- to high-fidelity. Experimentercontrol students followed an experimenter-defined progressive practice schedule. Open-ended students moved freely between the simulators. One week after practice, blinded experts evaluated students' skill transfer on a standardized patient simulation. Group differences were examined using analyses of variance. Results: Transfer test performance was similar for the Proficiency-based, Progressive and Open-ended groups; all outperformed the Experimenter-control group (effect size = 1.25). Surprisingly, most Open-ended students (73%) chose the progressive practice schedule. Conclusion and Discussion: Our key finding is that progressive training and proficiency-based training resulted in equivalent transfer test performance, suggesting that progressive students effectively chose when to transition between simulators. Students' preference for the progressive practice schedule indicates educators should consider this order for simulation-based training.

%X Introduction: Lupus is a chronic disease for which health education is an integral part of the treatment. Health education consists in teaching the patients how to manage everyday life with their illness. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of health education programs among patients with lupus. Methods: This experimental study was conducted by two doctors experienced in health education programs, one intern in paediatrics, and two trainee nurses. The health education program was offered to ten young women suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, aged between 13 and 17 years old. It did not receive any financial support or benefit from additional human resources, and relied exclusively on the internal organization within the board and among the research team members. Results: Seven of the ten women involved accepted to be part of the program. Every patient was first administered an educational assessment test, that was meant to evaluate the patients' already acquired skills as well as their expectations from the teaching. The program was designed to develop such skills as a better knowledge of the disease, adequate self-care and other psychosocial skills (adaptability, capacity to speak about the disease, etc.) To this day, two group sessions have already taken place and it has been our main concern to build them along with the patients. These sessions, of a duration of 2 hours and 45 minutes each, were scheduled some time away from the assessment session. Some educational tools were created during the sessions (card games, board games like “Time's up”, “Photolanguage”, a game specifically designed to help expression of feelings around the disease, other educational games and activities). Additional tools are in the process of being built. They include a tryptic about the disease (its physiopathology, its consequences, the future with lupus), which is intended to the use of other young patients. The patients' satisfaction with the program was assessed individually and collectively. This experimental program will be running until the end of 2014. It has been submitted to the Regional Health Agency for accreditation. Conclusion: By revealing the patients' demand for and satisfaction with the proposed health education sessions, this study has greatly encouraged us to continue this experimental health education program, which will soon be extended.

%X OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project is to increase the capacity of obstetricians, family physicians, and nurse midwives to counsel pregnant and nursing women about the benefits and risks of fish consumption. DESIGN: Recent analysis of NHANES data shows that up to 15% of women of childbearing age who eat fish ≥ 2 times per week may have elevated mercury levels. A recent national survey of obstetricians found that most do not discuss the health effects of environmental contaminants with their patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed six web-based modules that incorporate video, virtual reality clinical cases, and a discussion board to maximize the likelihood of changing clinical practice behavior. The modules were designed to be short, to repeat key learning points, and to involve action planning. We piloted the Healthy Fish Choices curriculum among randomly recruited prenatal and pediatric providers in the Great Lakes states. Participants completed pre-and post-tests for each module, a 3-6-month posttest, and a curriculum evaluation. Twelve credits of AMA Category 1 CME were offered. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty participants completed all six modules; 88% completed the 3-6 month follow-up. Participant specialties were 29% pediatricians, 31% family physicians, 31% midwives, and 8% obstetricians. All module post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores. The mean score on the 3-6 month post-test was 15% higher than mean cumulative pre-test scores. At curriculum completion 89% reported they would adopt or modify strategies for managing patients' fish intake; at follow-up 79% had adopted new practices such as providing lists of fish to avoid and information about adding fish to diet; improving screening for at-risk groups based on ethnicity and fish consumption levels; adding questions to electronic medical record screens; and providing patients with magnets and placing posters on the walls of their waiting rooms. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal providers completing the Healthy Fish Choices CME curriculum can help patients maximize the benefits of fish consumption while minimizing their exposure to contaminants in fish.

%X Purpose: High quality clinical data management is essential for delivering effective cancer care and monitoring care and outcomes. We report our experience establishing systems to improve documentation and collect data in adult and pediatric hematology/oncology at Tikur Anbessa Hospital (TAH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods: Over six weeks, an initiative was undertaken by the Georgetown University/ INCTR twinning program at TAH to develop a data management platform for adult and pediatric hematology/oncology. Multidisciplinary participation in process improvement and shared decision-making were central to our approach. Nurses from both units were integral to the team that worked to develop data collection tools and an electronic database, and establish the data manager role. Current clinical practices were observed and input was solicited from stakeholders. We sought to identify best data management practices at TAH. Individuals from NICU and Pediatrics ART were interviewed on their chart documentation and data collection strategies. Discussions were initiated with hematology/oncology departments on clinical data management; best practices were shared and new ideas elicited. Recommendations were presented, which included use of Clinical Shadow Charts, a Patient Registry and the Pediatric Oncology Networked Database (POND). Data collection tools captured demographic information, baseline clinical data, and longitudinal data on treatment, care and outcomes. We conducted an interactive workshop, during which interdisciplinary teams (18 physicians/residents and nurses) evaluated tools by analyzing data fields and inputting data from charts. The Director of the Clinical Trials office (a nurse) at INCTRBrussels reviewed the proposed tools and data management plan and made recommendations based on past experiences. Results: The outcome and current status of this initiative will be presented as well as continuing efforts by the nursing staff to address data collection. Conclusion: Our experience has shown multidisciplinary engagement with active nurse involvement can be a useful strategy for improving clinical documentation and integrating systematic data collection into clinical practice.

%X Background: Smoking is a major cause of preventable deaths. Plymouth has an adult smoking prevalence of 22%, costing the NHS in Plymouth ≤15.6 million (€17.9 million). Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust (PHNT) is among the city's larger employers. Smokers gathered outside hospital entrances, in smoking shelters and bus stops. A smokefree policy was made in 2004 but not enforced and later abandoned. Method: PHNT received funding from Smokefree South West in August 2011 to introduce better tobacco control by No Smoking Day, 15th March 2012. Before this date, we surveyed patients, visitors & staff: 66% felt the site should be smokefree. There were 140 smoking incidents (average) around hospital entrances per 8 hour period. Following Board approval, we arranged: internal & external communication; new signage; NRT on all wards; a smoking cessation e-learning package. The tobacco control policy was updated to allow staff free NRT and time to attend smoking cessation sessions. We trained nurses in key areas (Emergency Department and medical wards) to prescribe & dispense first dose NRT patch to smoking patients. On 15th March 2012, we removed all smoking shelters. Results: The number of smoking-related incidents fell sharply (<10) after smokefree status was introduced but has risen slowly since June 2012. Repeating our survey of patients, visitors and staff in Summer 2012, 86% felt the grounds of the hospital should be smokefree. We received positive feedback from patients and staff about the site's status. Ward nurses have been encouraged by being allowed to prescribe NRT per protocol. Lessons: Nurses giving first dose NRT works well. Maintaining smokefree status in practice requires both clear leadership to maintain focus and enforcement.

%X Introduction Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. The current rate of PPH in Victoria, Australia is 10.7%. The Maternity Services Education Program (MSEP) has facilitated a maternity emergency module in the Remote Area Nurse (RAN) Emergency Care Update Program for the past seven years. A core component of this module includes the immediate management for postpartum haemorrhage based on RAN and Ambulance Victoria clinical practice guidelines. Method Using patient simulation, clinicians demonstrated the immediate clinical management, stabilisation and transfer for a woman who experienced a postpartum haemorrhage in a bush nursing facility. The simulated scenario was observed in real time by RANs and Ambulance paramedics attending the update, learning from the scenario was further reinforced with a practical workstation. Results Analysis will be conducted using descriptive statistics and include a self rating of the usefulness of the simulated scenario to support RAN and Ambulance Victoria guidelines for the management of PPH. The surveys will be completed anonymously. Conclusion Survey analysis will identify components of the simulation that best meet individual learning required to support immediate management of PPH for RANs and Ambulance paramedics. Outcome results will inform further program development and reinforce the importance of this collaborative initiative.

%X A better understanding of the relationships between symptom recognition, nursing response, and preferred thinking style is needed to improve nursing education practices. Final semester nursing students (N = 29) completed a high fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) scenario; recognized symptoms (i.e., dyspnea) and responses (i.e., apply oxygen) were recorded, and compared with students' preferred thinking style using the Rational-Experiential Inventory-40. Relationships between concepts were explored. Significant relationships were noted between preference for Rational thinking styles and symptom recognition (p < .05). Preferred thinking style was not related to numbers of therapeutic responses. Thirty percent of students delayed application of oxygen until directed to do so by members of the health care team. Students having a stronger preference for rational thinking demonstrate greater accuracy in cue recognition. More nursing research is needed to explore the cognitive processing during simulation.

%X Think Aloud (TA), a strategy in which subjects are instructed to verbalize thoughts as they occur while completing an assigned task, was integrated into a study of clinical reasoning during high fidelity patient simulation by baccalaureate nursing students. TA methods in nursing education research with patient simulation have not previously been reported. Concurrent TA (verbalization of thoughts in short-term memory) and retrospective TA (reflective thoughts verbalized during an immediate post-simulation interview) methods facilitated the collection of rich and meaningful data. Students demonstrated distinct patterns in verbalization during concurrent TA, including public and private thoughts, narration of care, and the use of the pause to facilitate clinical reasoning. Retrospective TA data provided rich descriptions of reflection-on-action. TA provides a rich source of data regarding clinical reasoning as experienced by the baccalaureate nursing student during high fidelity patient simulation.

%X Aim: This paper outlines the initiation and implementation of a clinical audit program to ensure pain is managed in accordance with evidence based best practice. The aim was to determine if nurses recognised pain as a symptom and documented this evidence as the “Fifth Vital Sign”. To identify what training is required to achieve 100% compliance with hospital's pain policy standard, within an Irish Hospital. Background: Current research indicates that pain is underrecognised and under treated particularly among medical patients (Dix et al 2004). This is often attributed to lack of knowledge in pain assessment and documentation (Mann & Redwood 2004). Method: Ninety-three patients were recruited on five medical wards, during November 2010. Data was collected from patients' observation charts, for the presence or absence of pain scores using the numerical rating scale (NRS) within a 24-hour period. Results: Seventy four percent (n = 69) patients had pain scores documented. The distribution was similar in all medical wards. Results indicated a positive use of the (NRS) as recording pain as the “Fifth Vital Sign”. Action plan and conclusion: Aim for 100% compliance with hospital pain policy standard. Implement the changes to confirm that pain is documented as the “Fifth Vital Sign” for all medical patients and is managed accordingly. Encourage medical staff to participate in pain educational sessions on site and through National HSE e-learning. Continue to use the clinical audit process as part of quality improvement plan.

%X Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is a common cause of blindness. To assess the effects of medication compared with initial surgery in adults with OAG. We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2012), Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS) (January 1969 to August 2012), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (January 1937 to August 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), Zetoc, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 1 August 2012. The National Research Register (NRR) was last searched in 2007 after which the database was archived. We also checked the reference lists of articles and contacted researchers in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing medications with surgery in adults with OAG. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. Four trials involving 888 participants with previously untreated OAG were included. Surgery was Scheie's procedure in one trial and trabeculectomy in three trials. In three trials, primary medication was usually pilocarpine, in one trial it was a beta-blocker.The most recent trial included participants with on average mild OAG. At five years, the risk of progressive visual field loss, based on a three unit change of a composite visual field score, was not significantly different according to initial medication or initial trabeculectomy (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.01). In an analysis based on mean difference (MD) as a single index of visual field loss, the between treatment group difference in MD was -0.20 decibel (dB) (95% CI -1.31 to 0.91). For a subgroup with more severe glaucoma (MD -10 dB), findings from an exploratory analysis suggest that initial trabeculectomy was associated with marginally less visual field loss at five years than initial medication, (mean difference 0.74 dB (95% CI -0.00 to 1.48). Initial trabeculectomy was associated with lower average intraocular pressure (IOP) (mean difference 2.20 mmHg (95% CI 1.63 to 2.77) but more eye symptoms than medication (P = 0.0053). Beyond five years, visual acuity did not differ according to initial treatment (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.81).From three trials in more severe OAG, there is some evidence that medication was associated with more progressive visual field loss and 3 to 8 mmHg less IOP lowering than surgery. In the longer-term (two trials) the risk of failure of the randomised treatment was greater with medication than trabeculectomy (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.60 to 9.53; hazard ratio (HR) 7.27, 95% CI 2.23 to 25.71). Medications and surgery have evolved since these trials were undertaken.In three trials the risk of developing cataract was higher with trabeculectomy (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.64 to 4.42). Evidence from one trial suggests that, beyond five years, the risk of needing cataract surgery did not differ according to initial treatment policy (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.62).Methodological weaknesses were identified in all the trials. Primary surgery lowers IOP more than primary medication but is associated with more eye discomfort. One trial suggests that visual field restriction at five years is not significantly different whether initial treatment is medication or trabeculectomy. There is some evidence from two small trials in more severe OAG, that initial medication (pilocarpine, now rarely used as first line medica io ) is associated with more glaucoma progression than surgery. Beyond five years, there is no evidence of a difference in the need for cataract surgery according to initial treatment.The clinical and cost-effectiveness of contemporary medication (prostaglandin analogues, alpha2-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) compared with primary surgery is not known.Further RCTs of current medical treatments compared with surgery are required, particularly for people with severe glaucoma and in black ethnic groups. Outcomes should include those reported by patients. Economic evaluations are required to inform treatment policy.

%X Purpose: Medication errors account for approximately 1/3 af all adverse events(4). It is therefore very important that physicians and caregivers calculate the medication dose for a child correctly. To increase patient safety, we wanted to develop an e-learning course on how to calculate the correct medication dose. (4 Annual Report 2009, DSPS, National Board of Health, Denmark) Method: A multidiciplanary team of two nurses,a pharmacist, a physician and a multimedia programmer prepared a course concisting of a series of excersises for calculating doses of medicine together whit a final test. The examples were constructed from the daily drug perscriptions in the pediatric ward. Results: The course includes model solutions, explanations of units, symbols and useful formulas, a calculator where findings apply to the results field in each exercise and a notepad for the results of the intermediate calculations. Once an exercise has been solved, the response will be evaluated and there will be feedback in terms of explanatory comments, formulas and a model solution. The structure of the course consists of 5 modules for calculations concerning: solid drugs, liquid medicines, dilutions, infusions and composite tasks. In the final test there will be 2 questions from each module. The final test must be conducted annually and all answers must be correct to pass the test. 45% of the physicians and 75% of the caretakers have passed the test this year. Conclusion: The course is implemented in the childrens ward and is mandatory for all physicians and caregivers. An evaluation of the course will decide what need to be done to raise the pass rate.

%X OBJECTIVES: 1. Demonstrate the principles, philosophies and practices of age appropriate cancer care for Teenagers/Young Adults that enable them to navigate through the cancer journey from UK and Danish perspectives. 2. Demonstrate the significance of inter-professional working and learning in this emerging cancer and Teenage/Young Adult health speciality. METHODS: Historically; little attention has been given to the specific needs of the TYA (Teenage/Young Adult) cancer population and practice changes have been slow to occur internationally. This patient group has been described “at the edge of no man’s land” (Hollis and Morgan 2001). Teenage Cancer Trust is the leading UK Charity dedicated to improving the lives of young people with cancer. Over the past twenty five years the charity has funded the development of 23 specialist Teenage Cancer Units across the UK which deliver specialist care in a state of the art age appropriate environment. The charity also funds specialist Nurses and Youth Workers. Largely due to this momentum, TYA cancer care has gained recognition as a speciality within its own right. In contrast, professionals in Denmark, have adopted a different approach to TYA care using a network focused care approach and ‘network meetings’ (Olsen & Harder 2009). This model brings people from the patient’s private social network together with people from the patient’s health professional network, to help ‘break the ice’, keep lines of communication open, and help young patients with cancer mobilise their support networks at a time when they might otherwise be cut off from their normal lives(Olsen & Harder 2009). It is evident that age appropriate care and inter-professional team working are at the heart of TYA Cancer Care and these principles are central to any service development. Teenage Cancer Trust have captured these principles in their Blueprint of Care for Teenagers and Young Adults with Cancer (Smith et al 2012). For the first time, the growing body of knowledge and expertise of professionals working within this field, particularly those working within Teenage Cancer Trust Units, has been documented. Concurrently, an emergent professional educational need for those working in this field of oncology has arisen. In 2006, Coventry University with support from Teenage Cancer Trust developed a Post Graduate Certificate in Cancer Care for TYA’s that is delivered entirely by E-Learning which is now in its sixth year of delivery. The course draws from a multi-professional student body from across the world. It engages leading experts to create re-usable learning objects for the purpose of teaching which is delivered synchronously and asynchronously. E- learning offers flexibility, interactivity, motivation, collaboration and connectivity (JISC-E-Learning Programme n.d) for those working with TYA’s with Cancer to learn with, from and about each other (Barr 2001) in a virtual environment that is facilitated by expert teachers. International colleagues are now looking to the UK for support, guidance and education as other countries, including U.S.A, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and Sweden; now look to develop multi professional specialist care for this patient group. From the historic development of the first Teenage Cancer Trust Unit, the UK are now seen as worldwide leaders in TYA cancer care and young patients within healthcare increasingly move “beyond the edge of no man’s land”. We are keen to share experiences and collaborate so that care of TYA’s with cancer improves internationally. CONCLUSIONS: Internationally, TYA cancer care is gaining momentum as professionals recognise the unique needs of this vulnerable patient group and strive to develop and deliver services that meet their needs. The principles of “best practice” can now be described and young people are receiving expert care in bespoke environments. The TYA cancer “world” has largely remained isolated from the wider adolescent healthcare world. We can learn from each other and it is important t at international healthcare professionals now come together to share expertise in order to embed age appropriate cancer care for young people across the broader adolescent healthcare world.

%X Purpose: To establish a safe, efficient and robust workflow for radioembolization procedures planned and delivered in a multidisciplinary team environment by adopting a real-time online tracking system. Materials and Methods: With low toxicity and promising survival data, Yttrium-90 intra-arterial radiotherapy has been used for unresectable liver tumors. From patient scheduling to dose delivery, the entire treatment requires active participation by physicians, physicists, dosimetrists, therapists and nurses from different departments. The multi-disciplinary nature of the treatment increases the complexity of the workflow and the probability of miscommunication that can lead to potential errors. An efficient and ideally infallible communication system among teams and a verification mechanism are required to ensure patient safety and flow of treatment. At our institute, email was used as the primary communication tool. The use of email as a major communication tool resulted in several instances of treatment delays, patient rescheduling and potential misadministration. This motivated us to seek an alternative communication platform and improved workflow. In 2013, we implemented an in-house developed online tracking system (OTS) to report and monitor a patient's status during the planning process, e.g. treatment schedule, treatment site, required dosage, ordering, assay and delivery. The OTS also includes a verification or cross-checking mechanism which is performed by assigned members and must be done in a timely manner for the process to continue to the next step. As shown in Fig.1(a), the status of each step associated with different staff members may be labeled as 'N/A', 'Pending', 'In Progress', 'Approved', and 'Completed' to help the visualization and monitoring by the entire team. Members of the team have access to the OTS and can submit/update/ monitor patient information and treatment status as well as enter any notes directly into the OTS, making a single, immediately accessible repository for all treatment-related notes. Upon finishing each step, the system immediately notifies the key staff members directly responsible for performing the next step via email. By adopting the OTS as the central communication and information processing hub, we established the workflow shown in Fig.1(b). The development of this workflow was based on the analysis of previous near-misses and includes cross-checking actions (red box in Fig.1(b)) which were implemented at critical steps along the procedure. Feedback from staff members and analysis of potential pitfalls and near-miss events will be used to further refine the workflow. Results: The OTS communication platform offered a visualizable patienttracking interface, prevented overwhelming email notifications and helped the entire team perform tasks in a more confident and efficient way. The OTS and the accompanying workflow have been especially helpful since the patient throughput at our institution has significantly increased from ∼ 50 patients/yr (2010, 2011) to ∼ 100 patients/yr (2012, and estimated for 2013). The implemented verification procedures enabled the detection of several near-miss events: (1) disagreement on treatment date/time scheduling between two departments and (2) discrepancy on laterality of treatment site between physician team members. Conclusions: With the adoption of the OTS and cross-checking actions, a robust workflow can be established to achieve an eventfree or, at least, event-detectable treatment with the participation of multiple teams. Implementation of such a workflow can be expanded to other treatment procedures, especially in a multi-disciplinary team-involved plan delivery environment. Future work will focus on the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to further improve the workflow. (Figure Presented).

%X Background: Substantial data illustrate that older adults' functional decline is associated with adverse outcomes, and that physical activity (PA) may preserve mobility and reduce falls. However, few older adults in primary care are screened for mobility impairment or counseled on PA. Effective, efficient methods are needed to screen for mobility impairment in busy primary care practices. This pilot study employed a hybrid implementation/effectiveness design to a) implement mobility screening for older adults, assessing feasibility and acceptability, and b) assess the effectiveness of video-based motivational counseling to foster older adults' readiness to increase PA. Methods: We implemented (a) mobility testing with 4-meter gait speed and the Mobility Assessment Tool, short form (MAT-sf), a 3-minute patient self-report avatar tool, and (b) randomization either to a motivational counseling video for PA versus healthy-eating. Participants 65+ are being recruited from three primary care practices selected for diversity in setting and population. Participants (target N= 50 per site) will complete the 4m walk, MAT-sf, and survey of self-perceived risk for mobility loss. Participants are randomized to mobility counseling or healthy eating videos. Outcome measures include change in self-perceived risk of mobility impairment and attendance at a PA information session offered monthly at each clinic. Feasibility and acceptability data were gathered from stakeholders prior to the intervention and will be gathered after the intervention is complete. Results: Prior to the study, stakeholders from each site (n=3 physicians, n=3 medical assistants, and n=1 nurse) anticipated benefit to both patients and providers with potential value for practice change. The primary concerns were inadequate time and space; 12.5% voiced concerns over potential falls. Outcome measures include effectiveness of the mobility counseling video (change in self-perception of risk for mobility impairment, attendance at PA information session) and implementation measures (feasibility, acceptability). Conclusions: Implementation of physical function measures in primary care may assist in identifying a target population of older adults at high risk for mobility disability who may be recruited to evidence-based PA interventions.

The Essential Nursing Competencies and Curricula Guidelines for Genetics and Genomics, established by consensus, apply to all registered nurses. Learning outcomes and clinical practice indicators have been developed to provide additional guidance. The Essentials Advisory Group (EAG) established a team to establish the Outcome Indicators. A draft was developed based on published peer-reviewed documents and syllabi. The draft underwent three layers of review: (a) critique by the EAG; (b) review by representatives at a Genetics/Genomics Toolkit for Faculty meeting; and (c) review by workshop attendees of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's baccalaureate and master's education conferences, followed by EAG's final approval. Outcome Indicators clarify specific knowledge areas and suggest clinical performance indicators for each competency. They provide the foundation to establish a competency-based education repository with outcome indicator mapping matrixes for genetic/genomic education resources. A gap analysis of education resources identified resource deficits, and online unfolding case studies were developed. Outcome Indicators assist the academic and continuing education nurse community to prepare the nursing workforce in genetics/genomics and provide a platform from which to build tools needed to achieve this goal. © 2011.

%X Purpose/Objective: Assessment of difference between planned and delivered dose to rectum and bladder due to daily volume variation in patients with prostate cancer using the IGRT integrated in helical Tomotherapy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 15 patients with prostate cancer who received 70Gy in 2.5Gy/fr with Tomotherapy. Rectum and bladder preparation was done prior to the planning CT: each patient underwent an enema by nurse staff and 30 minutes before CT scan was asked to drink 500cc of water after voiding bladder. This preparation procedure was repeated every day before treatment. For prostate patients, daily Mega VoltageCT (MVCT) is performed in normal scan mode (4mm slice width) to acquire a volume including the whole volume of PTV, bladder and rectum. At the end of the whole treatment the bladder and rectum were re-contoured on the daily MVCT images set available on the Planned Adaptive Platform of Tomotherapy. The delivered dose distribution was recalculated for the new structures in the MVCT set using the same fine calculation grid used for planning. Cumulated relative and absolute DVH were extracted from each of the 420 treatment sessions analyzed. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was evaluated according to RTOG Scale. Comparison between planned and delivered dose were carried out for the following values: maximum, mean, V56 and V60 for rectum and maximum, mean, V50 and V60 for bladder. Results: Planning dose constraints were respected for each patient. Daily MVCT analysis showed non predictable volume changes over the course of treatment and very small variations of rectum volume compared to the planning phase. For bladder we observed larger volume variations, nevertheless an accurate patient preparation protocol, and found a significative correlation (pvalue = -0.6) between daily volume changes and dose received. No G2-G3 GU-GI acute toxicity was observed in this patients group. Conclusions: This study showed that delivered dose is correlated to organ shape and volume variation especially for bladder. Despite the presence of interfraction volume changes, for our patients group the rectal and bladder dose-volume tolerance criteria were always met. Further investigations will be oriented to evaluate late toxicity correlation to OAR volume and shape changes.

%X Objectives: To develop an education resource to suit the needs of healthcare professionals caring for Lymphoma Patients. Process: The Lymphoma Nurse Board members were identified as key in the generation of content to be delivered to healthcare professionals, as they possess knowledge of the current clinical requirements for nursing lymphoma patients and staff education issues. Using the nominal group technique (NGT), the group generated an action plan which identified the healthcare professionals to target; ways in which the education could be facilitated and finally a priority was identified to take forward. Further to this work an online and paper based survey was issued to the wider nursing forum members to generate a consensus opinion. Results: The final action plan identified that an online resource for the nursing members of the Lymphoma Association forum would allow an increase in their professional education, with the ultimate facilitation of the online resource as a cascade of education to all levels of staff within their local areas. The education will focus on core standards of care specific to lymphoma patients and will initially replicate the existing paper based resource. The online platform will give the opportunity to increasingly build a resource that will include case studies, interactive activities and will provide continuous professional development to enhance the healthcare professionals learning portfolios. Conclusion: This presentation will illuminate the inclusive development of an online resource and showcase the final education package.

%X The Nurses Improving the Care of Healthsystem Elders (NICHE) program helps its more than 450 member sites to build the leadership capabilities to enact system-level change that targets the unique needs of older adults and embeds evidence-based geriatrics knowledge into practice. NICHE received expansion funding to establish a sustainable business model for operations while positioning the program to continue as a leader in innovative senior care programs. The expansion program focused on developing an internal business infrastructure, expanding NICHE-specific resources, creating a Web platform, increasing the number of participating NICHE hospitals, enhancing and expanding the NICHE benchmarking service, supporting research that generates evidence-based practices, fostering interorganizational collaboration, developing sufficient diversified revenue sources, and increasing the penetration and level of activity of current NICHE sites. These activities (improved services, Web-based tools, better benchmarking) added value and made it feasible to charge hospitals an annual fee for access and participation. NICHE does not stipulate how institutions should modify geriatric care; rather, NICHE principles and tools are meant to be adapted to each site's unique institutional culture. This article describes the historical context, the rationale, and the business plan that has resulted in successful organizational outcomes, including financial sustainability of the business operations of NICHE. © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.

%X Introduction. Ensuring that patients who deteriorate in hospital receive appropriate and timely care is a key safety and quality challenge. Early recognition of clinical deterioration, followed by prompt and effective action, can prevent critical illness at an early stage. This prevents unnecessary cardiac arrest and improves the quality of care for those patients who may subsequently require admission to a critical care area. In September 2012, the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards were endorsed to provide a nationally consistent and uniform set of measures of safety and quality, with the criteria to ensure a patient's deterioration is recognised promptly and appropriate action is taken. OBJECTIVES. The Critical Care Liaison team embraced the NSQHS recommendations by developing the “Predict, Assess, Treat” clinical skills programme, utilising the common 'ABCDE' approach and interactive clinical scenarios, based on MET calls. The aim is to improve systems and practices for anticipating, recognising and responding to clinical deterioration. Clinical deterioration can happen at any point in a patient's illness or care process. Our programme is aimed at encouraging nurses at the bedside to proactively review their patients every day. This hands-on approach enhances the nurse's ability to recognise the patient at risk of deteriorating and implement simple, prompt actions in response. METHODS. Needs assessment survey was conducted to determine education and clinical skills gap between current and best practice. The format of programme is based on recognised principles of clinical teaching and uses a structured system of patient assessment and management to assist staff in patient care even when faced with unfamiliar clinical situations. Nursing, medical and allied health staff were invited to attend a study day following a structured format of lectures, skills stations and deteriorating patient simulation scenarios. Evaluation survey was conducted post education programme to appraise effectiveness. RESULTS. Over 350 staff have participated in the programme with a demonstrated improvement in recognition of patients deteriorating and improved response to alerting parent team and Liaison team for review of patient. Survey of staff has shown an increase in confidence to assess and predict clinical deterioration. Clinical skills education is associated with an increase in Liaison referrals, MET calls and a decrease in cardiac arrests. CONCLUSIONS. The 'Predict, Assess, Treat' clinical skills programme with interactive clinical scenarios is an excellent strategy for updating and promoting skills in early recognition and response to clinical deterioration, with resultant improvement in safety and quality of patient care.

%X Background: Advances in information and communication technology are influencing instructional formats and delivery modes for post secondary teaching and learning. Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine whether interprofessional team process skills traditionally taught in a small group face-to-face classroom setting could be taught in a blended learning environment; without compromising the pedagogical approach and collaborative Group Investigation Model (Sharan & Sharan 1992) used in the course. Method: A required interprofessional team development course designed to teach health science students (Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Dentistry, Dental Hygiene, Medical Laboratory Science, and Nutrition) team process skills was redesigned from a 100% face-to-face delivery format to a blended learning format where 70% of the instruction was delivered using a new synchronous virtual classroom technology (Elluminate www.elluminate.com) in conjunction with asynchronous technology (WebCT). It was hypothesized there would be no significant difference between the blended learning format and the traditional face-to-face format in the development of interprofessional team knowledge, skills and attitudes. The two formats were evaluated on demographic information, computer experience, and interprofessional team attitudes, knowledge and skills. Results: The three main findings are: (a) no significant differences between student groups on achieving team process skills, (b) an observation of differences between the groups on team dynamics, and (c) a more positive achievement of course learning objectives perceived by students in the blended learning class. Conclusions: The results provide evidence to support our blended learning format without compromising pedagogy. They also suggest that this format enhances students' perceptions of their learning.

%X Perioperative nurses must use critical thinking and sound clinical judgment to meet their patients' needs safely and effectively. This requires the integration and continual updating of large amounts of detailed clinical information. Innovative education strategies are designed to make teaching and learning more interesting and interactive, especially for the presentation of complex subject material. One interactive educational strategy is the use of games. Educational games can foster collaboration and critical thinking among peers and associates. An example of this was the Perioperative QuizBowl: Evidence-Based Practice presented at the annual AORN Congress from 2003 to 2010, which was used to teach and reinforce evidence-based practice in a fun, competitive way. Although AORN no longer presents this offering, the QuizBowl format demonstrates how educational games can support clinical practice. © 2011 AORN, Inc.

%X Introduction: Continuing professional development and education is vital to the provision of better health services and outcomes. The aim of this study is to contribute to the evidence base by performing a systematic review of qualitative data from studies reporting health professionals' experience of e-learning. No such previous review has been published. Method: A systematic review of qualitative data reporting UK health professionals' experiences of the ways in which on-line learning is delivered by higher education and other relevant institutions. Evidence synthesis was performed with the use of thematic analysis grounded in the data. Results: Literature searches identified 19 relevant studies. The subjects of the studies were nurses, midwives, and allied professions (8 studies), general practitioners and hospital doctors (6 studies), and a range of different health practitioners (5 studies). The majority of courses were stand-alone continuing professional development modules. Five key themes emerged from the data: peer communication, flexibility, support, knowledge validation, and course presentation and design. Discussion: The effectiveness of on-line learning is mediated by the learning experience. If they are to enhance health professionals' experience of e-learning, courses need to address presentation and course design; they must be flexible, offer mechanisms for both support and rapid assessment, and develop effective and efficient means of communication, especially among the students themselves. © 2009 The Alliance for Continuing Medical Education, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.

%X Early in 2015, Lord Willis proposed a 2+1+1 model of nursing education consisting of a two-year generic preparation of nurses, followed by a 'specialist' year which would address field-specific learning and a year of post-registration preceptorship. Discussion arose across areas of children's nursing about the potential ramifications of this proposed change. An electronic a survey of pre-registration children and young people's nurses was undertaken to generate their perspectives on the potential loss of the opportunity for future nurses to undertake specific pre-registration preparation for children and young people's nursing. The e-survey was circulated via professional networks and via Twitter and other social media forums and was open for three weeks and over 800 responses were received. Key findings show that children's nursing was the first choice of field for 98.3% of responders and of those who responded, 77% had not considered another field of nursing. Of the 33% who had considered a different field, 77% had considered adult nursing. In response to the question: 'Would you have chosen to train as a nurse if you had not been able to choose children's nursing?'; 50% said 'no'. Ninetyeight percent of the student respondents intended working in children and young people's nursing once they had registered. We believe that the best care of children and young people is provided by those who are specifically educated and prepared to care for them. Evidence from the survey suggests that there could be a loss of potential children's nurses if students are not able to select the field of nursing they wish to study. Furthermore, we believe that children's nursing is a field of practice and not a 'specialism' as defined in the report. This presentation will outline the issues that Raising the Bar: Shape of Caring raises for the profession and encourage debate to influence the Nursing and Midwifery Council in their forthcoming deliberations on this matter.

%X The 2015 European Cancer Congress (ECC2015) was the widest European platform for every professional involved in the struggle against cancer (17,656 participants, 2482 abstracts submitted). In this context, the nursing contribution was very relevant, involving high quality research and experience. The major nursing issues were: online information and support; innovations in cancer nursing roles; patient safety and the nursing workforce; managing older people with cancer and other co-morbidities; living with and beyond cancer; nutrition and body image changes; the changing face of cancer care for oncology nurses. Indeed, an important amount of research was presented during proffered papers and poster presentations by nurses from all over the world, concerning challenging issues, such as advanced nursing roles, end of life care, impact of cancer on patients and families, new developments, supportive and palliative care, survivorship and rehabilitation, symptom management and transitions in care. Nurses' presentations were mainly focused on understanding patients' needs and on sharing the best evidence-based approach to meet those needs. This is particularly significant in a field where innovation develops rapidly in every area of clinical practice, such as cancer care, bridging the weaknesses between different approaches and profiles, within the paradigm of multidisciplinarity.

%X Background: Throughout the history of nursing, the discoveries and system of belief of yesterday have served as a platform for the innovations of today. That is especially true for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach, exactly indeed perioperative practitioners have been challenged to stay abreast of technology in a field that is a constantly changing landscape of new techniques and improved instruments and equipment. The “laparoscopic revolution”of the 1980s propelled and encouraged the changes towards a less invasive approaches and new techniques, such as modern robotic-assisted surgery. Science and technology are advancing at an incredible pace and a critical analysis of these new developments become a duty in the perioperative nursing. Currently, minimally invasive surgeries, including robotic-assisted surgeries, are performed as routine in European Institute of Oncology (E.I.O.), especially in genitourinary, gynecologic, general, thoracic and head & neck surgery. The goals of our investigation were: 1. To assess needs of cancer patients undergoing robotic surgeries in different specialties, regarding preparation, mentioning physical and psychological needs, 2. To assess a multidisciplinary team collaboration during robotic surgeries, 3. nursing role description, and the specific 'learning-curve' of the beginner nurses. Methods: The investigation conducted at the European Institute for Oncology in Operating theatre by nurses involved in robotic surgery procedures. During three thousand robotic surgical procedures in different surgical specialty was registered a data using specifically designed form and analyzed daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. Results: The professional nursing staff has an important responsibility to work following best-practice rules, and to analyze periodically roles and habits could be an effective instrument in order to improve every-day practice. A team training that involves all members of the robotic surgical team learning together, is the main key to ensuring patient advocacy and safe care. Creation and application of guide lines and specific protocols is giving positive results in daily practice. Conclusion: The role of robotics nurse specialist is both challenging and exciting because the technology is so new and the role is open to interpretation and definition - needs of job description. Results showed us the needs of continues education, especially regarding e nursing skills, creation of guide lines and specific protocols. Nurses, as a member of Robotic Surgical team must represented very good level of professional knowledge, and be an expert in robotic technology. Playing a key role in data collection, analyzing trends and outcomes, and identifying safety issues.

%X Issues: With support of the Global Fund, free HAART was implemented in Peruvian public hospitals and health centres in 2004. This effort included the conformation and training of multidisciplinary teams (Physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers) responsible for the care of people living with HIV/AIDS throughout the country. Physicians working in remote regions would administer HAART for the first time and had to be thoroughly trained with limited resources. Description: The Telemedicine Unit of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute of Tropical Medicine developed a long-distance course on “Use of antiretrovirals” using an electronic platform as “classroom” Participants could access internet in their local hospitals or in public cabins which are widely distributed throughout Peru. The course took place from April-December 2005, covering 12 modules each lasting 2 weeks. Topics included adverse effects, antiretroviral schemes, resistance, vertical transmission, ethics, among others. (see www.upch.edu.pe/tropicales/telemedicinatarga). Each module consisted of a pre and post test, presentation, discussion forums, clinical cases and summaries of scientific articles. Lessons Learned: Sixty-eight physicians from 21 of the 24 Peruvian Regions started and 81% (n = 55) successfully completed the course. While 73% (n = 41) were already administering HAART, the others were waiting to be programmed by the Ministry of Health. Forty-nine physicians participated in an evaluation at the end of the course. They all pointed out the usefulness of the course in their daily practice; 98% (n = 48) classified the course as good/very good and 88% (n = 43) stated that the operational system was easy/very easy to use. Recommendations: After the successful implementation of a long-distance course about use of antiretrovirals, this course will be repeated for a broader target group of Peruvian physicians administrating HAART. Telemedicine has shown to be a powerful and practical tool for continuous training of health care personnel throughout the country and for the reinforcement of quality care to people living with HIV/AIDS.

%X The primary mission of ARS is to promote public health in its region and ensure the best care supply. Furthermore, ARS IdF is committed to making vigilance network more efficient, for the entire region and for all sectors of activities (ambulatory, medico-social and hospital). Since September 2011, exchanges have been set up with the six regional pharmacovigilance centers from the Idf region in order to organize collaboration, despite the lack of legal legitimacy of the regional health agency in this area. In July 2013, the federation of pharmacovigilance of Ile-de-France was officially created. Exchanges have been set up between ARS IdF, the 6 CRPV and the AP-HP and led to: • The elaboration of a collaborative internet platform for reporting dedicated to health professionals and consumers, which is now available. • The creation of a collaborative working group including health professional representatives (pharmacists, medical doctors, nurses, hospital federations, e.g) for discussion and analysis of drug problems in the IdF region • A pilot study conducted during 2 months in March and April 2013, in order to assess the relevance and feasibility of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) direct transmission to the ARS. The analysis shows that ARS should be informed on serious ADRs suspected to be due to bad practices, such as medical errors and other signals warranting actions from ARS (on-site instruction, or inspection. . .) • An observational multicenter prospective cohort (PRESAGE - Pharmacovigilance REgionale pour les Sujets AGEs) for an active surveillance of drug safety in elderly. The PRESAGE network associates the regional federation of pharmacovigilance, the ARS, Omedit and pharmaco-epidemiology unit of Bichat hospital.

%X Background: Increasing antimicrobial resistance has been identified as a global threat to health. Antimicrobial stewardship measures to improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing have been implemented with varying success. Whilst prescriber knowledge and skills are important, attention to behavioural and social aspects seems essential to sustain improvement initiatives. Serious games and gamification have been introduced in other settings to maintain engagement with desired behaviours. We report the development of a serious smartphone prescribing game to support the prudent use of antimicrobials in acute care prescribers. Methods&Materials: In collaboration with a commercial game company, a decision tree of prescribing options was developed for a series of virtual patients. Prescribers iteratively receive clinical information for each patient, prompting diagnosis and treatment decisions for each case (Figure 1). Clinicians can use 1) oral antibiotics, 2) broad- or 3) narrow-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotics, 4) request further tests or 5) discharge without treatment. The game provides immediate feedback on performance, considering clinical accuracy and impact on other professionals and wider hospital environment. To sustain the focus on the game, elements such as timers, scores and leaderboards, together with increasing case difficulty are used. Delayed consequences of prescribing decisions are made explicit for the players; for example, using broad-spectrum antibiotics too frequently will lead to patients attending with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, or prolonged use of IV antibiotics will result in cannula-site infection cases. Results: A multi-method approach will be used to evaluate the game. An interrupted time-series analysing antimicrobial consumption (daily-defined doses per 100 occupied bed-days per year) data before and after game introduction will identify vari- ations in prescribing decisions, including the proportion of broadand narrow-spectrum antibiotics used; ethnographic approaches will describe prescribers perceptions on their experience; in-game analytics will report engagement with the game and elicit any dose-effect relations (i.e., increased game time greatly improving prescribing decisions). The influence of prompts by different professionals (doctors, nurses, pharmacists or hospital managers) on prescriber's decisions will be explored. Conclusion: The sustainability of optimal prescribing behaviours remains a challenge for antimicrobial stewardship initiatives worldwide. Serious games may be an affordable and feasible solution to address behavioural and social influences on prescribing.

%X Background: Scalable antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interventions are needed. A potential intervention platform is the use of patient Web sites that allow shared access to electronic medical records (EMR) and secure online communications between patients and providers. This study examined acceptability and feasibility of these tools in supporting ART adherence. Methods: Adult HIV+ patients enrolled in two health plans were screened for adherence lapses, new or changed regimens, and detectable viral loads. Patients with and without prior portal experience were eligible.Of 42 screened eligible, 29 (69%) completed online consents and baseline Web surveys. Participants were randomized to receive 6 securemessages froman adherence intervention nurse (n= 20) or 6 attention control e-mails (n = 9). Adherence Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) baseline survey responses were used to individually tailor intervention messages. 26 participants (89%) completed 3-month post-intervention surveys and acceptability interviews. Results: Common adherence barriers included deficits in information (how ART works [38%], ART side effects (26%), ART interactions with alcohol and drugs [21%]), motivation (concerns about ART hurting health (79%), frustration with lifelong treatment [72%]), and behavioral skills (managing side effects [59%], adapting to changes in routine [52%]). 82% of intervention respondents found messages useful and 94% would recommend the study to others. Bimonthly messages were acceptable, with all respondents opening study messages. Web services found most useful were e-mailing doctors, ordering medications, setting appointments, and viewing labs. Conclusions: It was feasible to generate individualized intervention algorithms from IMB model-based Web surveys. Retention was good and Web services appeared to offer added benefits to participants. EMR patient portals show promise as an acceptable and feasible intervention delivery vehicle for supporting patient adherence.

%X Introduction: The patient with cancer has many issues of great complexity for comprehensive assistance. In the course of their disease and treatment can present emergency situations that nurses should detect early and actwith knowledge. The high demand for training in oncological nursing motivates the realization of a free online course that facilitates access to academic education. Objective: To evaluate the response of adherence of nurses at online course in Oncological Emergencies in Argentina and Latin American countries. Methods: Online Course Opening in May 2014, diffusion done by Internet, on paper, meetings and conferences. Open to enrolled nurses. It contains nine modules, published weekly, with topics such as: hypercalcemia, tumor lysis syndrome, spinal cord compression, intracranial hypertension metastatic, superior vena cava syndrome, febrile neutropenia. Each module has therapeutic approaches, nursing care, and presents an evaluation at the end of training. After attending all modules a final evaluation is done and if approved they receive a certificate. Results: The course provided a total of 1107 volunteers registered nurses. 60% completed it. 9140 visits were recorded at the site, from 25 countries of which 15 (60%) were from Latin America. From Argentina received visits from 15 provinces and 124 cities, and had a total of 644 (58%) enrolled Argentines who completed the course. 9702 downloads were classes in PDF and 729 discharges were literature. Foreigners who completed the course: 25 (3.7%). Conclusion: The results provide evidence of adherence of nurses to the online course with 60% approval. The e-learning for nurses in the area of oncology in Latin America is a useful tool that facilitates access to the training of nurses in our country and creative exchange with nurses worldwide.

%X Background: To test the change in the knowledge of the study participants following a Blended Training and Learning Approach (BTLA). Secondly, the paper also tries to discuss the use of this method over the classical classroom based trainings. Frontline health functionaries are the backbone of almost all health goals. It is therefore essential to ensure proper training of this cadre of workers for optimum service delivery. The present paper tries to discuss the use of an effective new training pedagogy over the classical classroom based trainings. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2013 to April 2014 in all districts in the state of Odisha. The study participants comprised of two groups. Group 1: Integrated Child Development Services supervisors, Child Development Project Officers received training on reduction of stunting. Group 2: Nutrition Counselors and Auxiliary Nurses and Midwifes received training on management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Selection of participants was done following complete enumeration technique. The training effectiveness was measured using paired t-test. Out of approximately 2400 participants identified across the state of Odisha, 2350 participants provided consent to participate in the study. Results: The change in knowledge was determined by using paired t-test. The results of the paired t-test for the training on reduction of stunting were significant, P < 0.001, indicates that there was a significant increase in the score from (mean = 11.4; standard deviation [SD] = 2.34) to the post-test (mean = 13.8; SD = 2.34). The mean increase was 2.4 with 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference between means of 11.4 and 13.8. Similar test was conducted to evaluate the training on SAM. The results of the paired t-test were significant, P < 0.001, indicates that there was a significant increase in the score from (mean = 14.7; SD = 2.8) to the post-test (mean = 15.8; SD = 2.3). The mean increase was 1.12 with 95% CI for the difference between means of mean = 14.7 to mean = 15.8. There are different approaches that can be adapted during any training ranging from the traditional form of classroom teaching to the new technologically advanced forms of training such as e-learning. Understanding the merits and demerits, there was the felt need to try a newer approach of training. Thus, the method of BTLA was tried in the study and was proved to be effective. Conclusions: The newly tried and tested pedagogy of training would provide the necessary evidence for future policy decisions.

%X Engaging with children, young people and their families with palliative and complex care needs requires intelligent ethical practice in which the practitioner works therapeutically and sensitively delivering high quality evidencebased care to meet the individual needs of the child and their families. Funding from the Department of Health in 2010 has permitted the design and development of an innovative module of learning aimed at practitioners working in the filed of children and families. The module is aimed at all members of the multidisciplinary team which includes Registered Nurses, Advanced Nurse Practitioners, Midwives, Doctors, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Social Workers, and individuals working in health informatics, and charity workers. This innovative module is unique in style of delivery and assessment. All elements of teaching and learning are based within a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). The module has been developed in association with expert clinical practitioners, senior academics and in collaboration with the learning Innovation team. A small town 'Central City' has been created in a virtual world (Second Life) to augment 'real life' situations. Within the virtual world several buildings have been constructed that are considered appropriate to challenge the care management and delivery for children and young people with palliative and complex care needs. Within Central City the following can be explored: a children's hospital, children's hospice, community resource centre, multi-faith centre, school environments and different houses that present challenges to care and accessibility. The module uses Problem Based Learning (PBL) triggers within this safe environment through the assimilation of caseload management. Engagement of the learners and e-facilitators is expected through the interaction within the virtual world. Each participant requires an avatar to explore the virtual world and to immerse into the learning simulation. The module team will provide weekly direction and support. (Figure presented).

%X PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the CBL experience of Hong Kong students using both traditional classroom and Web-based approaches in undergraduate nursing education. This experience is examined in terms of the perceived self-learning ability, clinical reasoning ability, and satisfaction in learning of these students. METHODS: A mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches was adopted. All Year-3 undergraduate nursing students were recruited. CBL was conducted using the traditional classroom approach in Semester 1, and the Web-based approach was conducted in Semester 2. Student evaluations were collected at the end of each semester using a self-report questionnaire. In-depth, focus-group interviews were conducted at the end of Semester 2. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two students returned their questionnaires. No difference between the face-to-face and Web-based approaches was found in terms of self-learning ability (p = .947), clinical reasoning ability (p = .721), and satisfaction (p = .083). Focus group interview findings complemented survey findings and revealed five themes that reflected the CBL learning experience of Hong Kong students. These themes were (a) the structure of CBL, (b) the learning environment of Web-based CBL, (c) critical thinking and problem solving, (d) cultural influence on CBL learning experience, and (e) student-centered and teacher-centered learning. CONCLUSIONS: The Web-based CBL approach was comparable but not superior to the traditional classroom CBL approach. The Web-based CBL experience of these students sheds light on the impact of Chinese culture on student learning behavior and preferences. BACKGROUND: Case-based learning (CBL) is an effective educational method for improving the learning and clinical reasoning skills of students. Advances in e-learning technology have supported the development of the Web-based CBL approach to teaching as an alternative or supplement to the traditional classroom approach.

%X BACKGROUND: An internationalized curriculum in nursing education was created in response to the rise of globalization and the need to provide nursing care to people of diverse cultures. Through technology, internationalization at home can facilitate intercultural experiences for more nursing students. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore and describe how a virtual course in intercultural communication between students of two universities, through internationalization at home, can support the development of cultural competence. DESIGN: Qualitative research PARTICIPANTS: Junior year nursing students METHOD: Qualitative content analysis of transcribed written and oral presentations during a course on intercultural communication. RESULTS: Four major themes, which are not mutually exclusive, were identified. CONCLUSION: Through this intercultural experience, without leaving home, students uncovered their cultural selves and others based on their own reflective understanding and collaborative discourse with each other and the use of social media for communication. Through experiential intercultural encounters beyond textbook and online materials, they learned to appreciate each other as people with cultural differences yet with much in common, and to recognize their assumptions and the value of subtleties and nuances. They were able to explore solutions within an unfamiliar context through their own efforts and with the support of peers and teachers. This led to a deeper understanding of cultural sensitivity and competence.

%X Introduction: The HKICNA was founded in 1989 with only 44 members including advisors. They all shared experiences and a vision with strong will, contributing their own time to promote infection prevention and control. The followings were efforts witnessing the development, impacts to the profession, staff and community. A new norm of infection control was born, working in partners with and contributing to the healthcare system in Hong Kong. Objectives: To promote infection control across the boundaries. Methods: The objective was achieved through the continuous education by a dedicated group of assertive and committed nurses who possess knowledge and innovative ideas networking together towards a humanized infection control for the health of all by all means. Period: in 25 years' time since 1989. Results: The HKICNA members have expanded to twenty-fold of the original and up to 1400 in 2003-2004. To build up knowledge, training course was organized annually since 1999 which was well recognized by hospitals in Hong Kong with attendances >5000; ad hoc seminars on novel emerging diseases were as needed. In 2002, biannual HKICNA newsletter was first published; to strengthen the network with international authorities, biennial International Conference was organized in collaboration with local nursing associations from 2004 onwards; which served as a platform for experience sharing from 800 - 1000 overseas' delegates in each event. The webpage was developed in 2007 to enhance communication and promotion. Participation in health carnival in 2010 broadened the scope to community involving public. There were innovative activities e.g. research grant award, sponsorship and scholarship, hand hygiene poster design competition and video on “Hand Hygiene Dance” for different generations to enhance sustainability. Conclusion: With the support from our healthcare workers and public, and guidance from renowned advisors; HKICNA, with all the education and promotion works, has been growing more influential in the healthcare system in Hong Kong and also serves as a bridge for the overseas. The association stands for Humanity, Knowledge, Innovation, Commitment, Networking and Assertiveness; which is the key to success.

%X Neonatal mortality can be largely prevented by wide-scale coverage of components of essential newborn care and management of sick neonates in district-level healthcare facilities. A vital step in this direction is imparting the requisite knowledge and skill among healthcare providers. Medical education programs with their static curricula seldom adapt to the changing needs of neonatal healthcare providers in patient-centered, collaborative and remote delivery contexts. E-learning is emerging as the cutting edge tool towards refinement of knowledge, attitude and practices of physicians. Module-based e-learning courses can be blended with a skill learning contact period in partnering institutions thus saving resources and rapidly covering a wide geographical region with uniform standardized education. In this review, the authors discuss their experience with e-learning aimed at introducing and refining the understanding of sick newborn care among pre-service and in-service doctors who manage neonates.

%X The steady evolution of domestic industries and the continued expansion of the workforce have outdated Taiwan's traditional model of occupational health nursing, which focuses on preventing work-related diseases and ensuring workplace safety. Professional-competency evaluations, now widely used within the medical and other professional communities to confirm that individuals have mastered relevant knowledge and skills, are a fixture in service quality management and related strategies. Occupational health nurses have a critical role in promoting and ensuring the quality of occupational-health related services. A multifaceted strategy is needed to update the domestic model of occupational health nursing. This strategy should include: 1) Set professional standards and create standard teaching materials for national occupational health nurses; 2) Enhance the professional efficacy of nurses in this field; 3) Survey the relevant role functions and education/training needs of occupational health nurses; 4) Develop relevant elective courses; and 5) Format courses/curricula for e-learning and for multimedia platforms. Furthermore, after implementation of this strategy, the model should be evaluated in terms of the knowledge and skills acquired by occupational health nurses. It is hoped that by reflecting local needs and experiences this new model will update the field of occupational health nursing to meet the needs of the current and future workplace in Taiwan and increase nursing knowledge and skills in order to foster and sustain healthy workplace environments.

%X Objective: To describe the Instructional System Design Processes (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) used to develop an e-learning education programme for staff nurses at a 700-bed teaching medical center in Taiwan. Background: Evidence has shown that education via e-learning improves knowledge and skills; however, with cost constraints and limited resources, finding effective alternatives is critical for health professionals. Methods: Five courses required for N2 to N3 level nurses were designed for both e-learning and traditional in-classroom programmes. Multiple-choice written test questions and a satisfaction questionnaire were used to compare outcomes between programmes. Nursing care skills were rated as pass or fail. Both programmes were begun at the same time and completed within a 3-month period. Results: Forty-two staff nurses participated in this study. All nurses' knowledge scores were >70 points (out of 100) and all passed nursing care skills. In five courses, only teaching and learning and communication were statistically significantly different (p = 0.001). Nearly all nurses (97.6%) felt satisfied or very satisfied with the programmes. Conclusions: Instructional System Design Processes provide an alternative delivery system for in-service nursing education which allows for individualized leaning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Program/Project Purpose: India is the second most populous country in the world with a population of 1.21 billion. With nearly 72 percent of the country's population living in rural areas, there is a need to improve the quality of care for rural population. Huge disparities exist in the healthcare status of urban and rural India. The doctor patient ratio in rural India is 1:20,000, while the urban ratio is 1:2,000 against the statutory 1:250 ratio from WHO for which India requires 6,00,000 doctors. Capacity building of healthcare workforce at all levels has, thus, been a key focus of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), a flagship scheme of Government of India to improve healthcare delivery in rural India. However, continuous skill development is a huge challenge, given the large number of rural health workforce. As per the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) for Primary Health Centres (PHCs), training of health workers is crucial to maintain quality of services being offered at PHCs. e-Learning has evolved as a preferred mode to deliver training solutions for rural health workforce, globally. In one of the instances, African Medical & Research Foundation (AMREF), in partnership with the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK), Accenture, Kenya Medical Training Colleges, several private and faith-based nursing schools and the Ministry of Health Kenya, pioneered a country-wide e- Learning program for upgrading community nurses in Kenya. Similarly, the Indian states, which have adopted e-training of rural health workforce of NRHM have demonstrated improved healthcare statistics owing to better delivery by highly skilled staff.

%X Purpose: The HKICNA was founded in 1989 with only 44 members including advisors. They all shared experiences and a vision with strong will, contributing their own time to promote infection prevention and control. The followings were efforts witnessing the development, impacts to the profession, staff, community and a new norm of the healthcare system in Hong Kong. Methods: It was through the continuous education by a dedicated group of assertive and committed nurses who possess knowledge and innovative ideas networking together towards a humanized infection control for the health of all by all means. Results: Members have expanded to twenty-fold of the original and up to 1400 in 2003-04. To build up knowledge, training course was organized annually since 1999 which was well recognized by hospitals in Hong Kong with attendances >5000; ad hoc seminars on novel emerging diseases were as needed. In 2002, biannual HKICNA newsletter was first published; to strengthen the network with international authorities, biennial International Conference was organized in collaboration with local nursing associations from 2004 onwards; which served as a platform for experience sharing from 800 - 1000 overseas' delegates in each event.

%X High risk population numbers measured by nursing staff differ greatly from those measured by case managers due to differences in screening approaches used in discharge planning services. This project intended to identify and analyze the relevant problems and develop an improvement plan to reduce the discrepancy. The authors observed the clinical situation, interviewed nurses, and designed a questionnaire to evaluate the suitability of a designed screening table to collect nurses' opinions on a high risk population checklist. Based on collected data, we identified and analyzed the cause of the gap, then revised current measurement tools to improve efficacy. Strategies included providing in-service education related to discharge planning for nurses, revising discharge planning manuals, and re-developing the screening scale for high-risk populations. After implementation of the intervention, the difference of screening the high risk population between nursing staff and case manager decreased from 45.9% to 6.7%, and the hit rate on the discharge planning page on the e-learning web site increased to 89.8%. CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Results showed that interventions enhanced nurse capabilities in screening high risk populations in the ward, and effectively elevated the accuracy of screening high-risk patients in discharge plans, thus elevating outpatient care quality. This project is suggested as a reference for hospitals developing training programs for discharge planning seed nurses in the wards. Once completed, these nurses can help expand the scope of discharge service to ensure medical resources are used more effectively.

%X Due to its geographic position and the effect of changes in both global and island-specific environments, Taiwan is an area highly prone to natural disasters. While responsibility for national disaster prevention and rescue are distributed amongst various authorities, healthcare agencies hold sole responsibility for the treatment of injuries sustained during disaster events. Disaster casualties require differing levels of medical assistance. In order to respond systematically to disaster events, the government should require that all healthcare facilities operate a hospital emergency incident command system (HEICS). Past experience shows the important role that nurses play in the disaster relief process. The 911 disaster in the United States both helped reorient the direction of nursing education and emphasized teaching practical strategies, standard operating procedures, and frequently asked questions for nurses. Recognizing the limited research done worldwide on disaster nursing, the World Society of Disaster Nursing (WSDN) was established in 2008 in Kobe, Japan. The main purposes of the WSDN is to promote international academic exchange, establish an Internet information exchange platform, and organize international disaster nursing related activities. The WSDN has suggested that future research may focus in on critical issues that include post-disaster health status follow-up, exploration of the healthcare needs and other issues of disaster survivors, care skills development, and the potential for development of cooperative support networks between medical institutions.

%X High-fidelity patient simulation teaching represents one of the most important innovations in healthcare education in the past two decades. In Taiwan, many medical centers and medical colleges now have clinical skill centers equipped with a high-fidelity patient simulator. Practicing clinical scenarios in this simulated environment can help strengthen students' professional essentials and competencies outside of classroom and clinical teaching settings. High-fidelity simulation teaching is an integrated teaching strategy that is continuing to receive greater attention. This article describes the historical development of high-fidelity patient simulation teaching, its current status, and applications in nursing education as a reference for nursing educators.

%X Online learning has become a common means of enhancing face-to-face classroom learning and is at the center of most collaborative, multimedia educational environments. There is some evidence that students' self-regulatory (SR) learning can be facilitated in a web-based learning environment, but studies of the effectiveness of self-directed online courses for post-registration nursing students have been few, and the results have been inconclusive. This study qualitatively examined the ways in which adding an online, asynchronous learning component to a nursing course might facilitate post-registration nursing students' self-regulatory learning. Learners' asynchronous communication on an online bulletin board comprised the qualitative dataset. Content related to their e-learning activities and experiences was extracted and generalized in order to examine the possible effects of this online interaction on SR learning. The themes that emerged indicated that students practiced SR learning skills through their online peer interaction. We propose several strategies for facilitating a self-regulatory learning environment based on these results from a course for post-registration nursing students in Taiwan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Introduction: Anemia is known to be a negative morbidity and mortality multiplier in the hospitalized setting. Iatrogenic blood loss is known to be a component of anemia, and has been studied in very isolated acute care settings, limiting broader applicability. Institution wide practices are unknown in the literature, and the representation of such large data sets using numerical approaches may be overwhelming to humanly analyse. To uncover the issue of excess phelbotomy at our institution, we developed a novel informatics driven visualization of phlebotomy patterns as a first step to change institutional culture. Methods: Data was extracted from the laboratory information system (Cerner) for a three-month period (September 2009-December 2009) for all of the inpatient units at Capital District Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia. Patient information was limited to non-patient identifiers including sample volumes, test timestamps, ward and facility locations. This information was extracted cleaned, and analysed/visualized using a commonly available spreadsheet platform. Results: During this pilot 90 day period, there were 6749 unique inpatients with phlebotomies over 13 hospital buildings, 81 nursing locations, and 57 documented clinical services. In total 589, 194mL of blood was drawn from these patients, averaging of 87.3mL per patient using 15 different types of tubes. The visualisation highlighted not only phlebotomy pattern information, but gave visual information about ward turnover, hospital stay length (short vs. long stay), phlebotomy intensity, and the phlebotomy pattern. Conclusions: Iatrogenic blood loss secondary to phlebotomy is a preventable cause of anemia, but has been largely not studied in the literature. We present a novel visualization technique, allowing for institution wide insights into phlebotomy culture. This information is easily understood by policymakers and can be used to further inform and change phlebotomy culture at an institution and improve patient outcomes.

%X In-service education affects the quality of cancer care directly. Using classroom teaching to deliver in-service education is often ineffective due to participants' large workload and shift requirements. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness of different teaching methods in the dimensions of knowledge, attitude, and learning satisfaction. This study used a quasi-experimental study design. Participants were cancer ward nurses working at one medical center in northern Taiwan. Participants were divided into an experimental group and control group. The experimental group took an e-learning course and the control group took a standard classroom course using the same basic course material. Researchers evaluated the learning efficacy of each group using a questionnaire based on the quality of cancer nursing care learning effectiveness scale. All participants answered the questionnaire once before and once after completing the course. (1) Post-test "knowledge" scores for both groups were significantly higher than pre-test scores for both groups. Post-test "attitude" scores were significantly higher for the control group, while the experimental group reported no significant change. (2) after a covariance analysis of the pre-test scores for both groups, the post-test score for the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group in the knowledge dimension. Post-test scores did not differ significantly from pre-test scores for either group in the attitude dimension. (3) Post-test satisfaction scores between the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to teaching methods. The e-learning method, however, was demonstrated as more flexible than the classroom teaching method. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Study results demonstrate the importance of employing a variety of teaching methods to instruct clinical nursing staff. We suggest that both classroom teaching and e-learning instruction methods be used to enhance the quality of cancer nursing care education programs. We also encourage that interactivity between student and instructor be incorporated into e-learning course designs to enhance effectiveness.

%X To ensure the quality of healthcare provision, nurses must continuously enhance their professional knowledge and competencies via continuing education. As compared with traditional learning, electronic learning (e-learning) is a more flexible method for nurses' in-service learning. Hence, e-learning is expected to play a key role in providing continuing education for nurses. The main purpose of this study was to examine whether system quality, information quality, service quality, and user-interface design quality as the antecedents to nurse beliefs can affect nurses' intention to use the e-learning system. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the effects of information systems quality on nurses' acceptance of the e-learning system. This study gathered sample data from nurses at 3 hospitals in Taiwan. A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed, and 320 effective questionnaires were analyzed in this study, indicating an effective response rate of 71.1%. Collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. System quality, information quality, and user-interface design quality had significant effects on perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE), and service quality had significant effects on PU and PEOU. Moreover, PEOU had significant effects on PU and PE, and the effects of PU, PEOU, and PE on intention to use were significant. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: User-interface design quality is the most key antecedent that can make significant impacts on nurses' PU and PE, and more efforts should be made to develop a friendlier user interface via designing useful and enjoyable features to induce nurses to use the e-learning system. Moreover, system quality can make the greatest impact on nurses' PEOU; thus, medical institutions should effectively enhance system quality to deliver benefits and pleasure to boost nurses' usage intention of the e-learning system via reducing the complexity.

%X INTRODUCTION: Continuous vital sign (VS) monitoring with stand alone bedside monitors is standard practice in ICUs and operating rooms; however, these systems are expensive and constrained to certain environments. The Vios System (VMS, Vios Medical, Inc. St. Paul, MN, USA) is the first FDA-cleared platform to utilize commercially available hardware for wireless patient monitoring in low, mid, or high acuity settings. The VMS system allows for flexible and low-cost monitoring through a wireless (Bluetooth) sensor placed on a patient's chest. VMS has capability for real-time analysis and display on a bedside or central station monitor, and synchronized for remote viewing from any global location. In this pilot study we evaluated the accuracy of VMS as compared to gold-standard bedside monitoring systems. METHODS: After IRB approval and informed consent 1 physician and 8 nurses were trained on the VITALS1 protocol. 55 adult patients indicated for monitoring within the cardiac step-down unit following cardiac catheterization were enrolled into the study. VS data was acquired simultaneously by the VMS (figure 1) and the existing bedside monitor. Specifically, ECG (lead I and II morphology/artifacting), HR, RR, SPO2, pulse rate, axillary temperature, and posture were captured by each system. Each patient was monitored for a minimum of 10 minutes, during which 5 comparative data points were captured for each VS. For patient posture, the nurse recorded a visual assessment of the patient. The nurses and patients each completed a questionnaire about the VMS system after use. The data was analyzed using regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots with p <0.05 considered significant RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 55 years (range 19-82), mean weight 65kg (range 48-90), and mean BMI 26.2 kg/m2 (range 20-67). None were unstable. The comparative data was highly correlated for ECG, HR, RR, pulse rate and SPO2 with significant agreement between the traditional and VMS (Table). Patient posture was accurately reflected 100% of the time. The nurses and patients were favorably impressed and preferred the VMS to the existing system. DISCUSSION and CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study confirmed the successful transmission, analysis, and accuracy of the VMS that was well-received. Several studies are being planned to evaluate its acceptance into standard clinical practice and its capability to extend vigilance into environments beyond the hospital allowing remote patient management services. Monitoring patient orientation and activity are additional value points of the VMS system. Benefits of this new clinical metric are: 1) ability to monitor neurological status, 2) potential to decrease pressure ulcers and DVT, and 3) be used as a readiness for discharge tool.

%X Aim: To examine the use of social networking sites in recruiting research participants. Background: Workplace violence is an important issue for staff and patients. One workplace that reports the highest levels of violence is the emergency department. The ability to research issues such as workplace violence in real time is important in addressing them expeditiously, and social media can be used to advertise and recruit research subjects, implement studies and disseminate information. Review methods: The experience of recruiting subjects through social networks, specifically Facebook, and the use of participant information clips (PICs) for advertising. Discussion: A brief discussion of the history of advertising and communication using the internet is presented to provide an understanding of the trajectory of social media and implications for recruitment in general. The paper then focuses on the lead author's experience of recruiting subjects using Facebook,including its limitations and advantages, and her experience of using participant information clips. The low cost of advertising and recruiting participants this way, as well as the convenience provided to participants, resulted in almost half the study's total participants being obtained within 72 hours. Conclusion: Using Facebook to target a younger age range of nurses to participate in a study was successful and yielded a large number of completed responses in a short time period at little cost to the researcher. Recording the PIC was cheap, and posting it and a link to the site on pre-existing group pages was free, providing valuable viral marketing and snowball recruiting. Implications for research/practice: Future researchers should not overlook using social network sites for recruitment if the demographics of the desired study population and subject matter permit it. © 2014 RCN Publishing Ltd.

%X BACKGROUND: Empirical studies show the value of mobile phones as effective educational tools to support learning in the nursing profession, predominantly in high income countries. PROBLEM STATEMENT: The rapidly increasing prevalence of mobile phone technology in Africa nourishes hopes that these tools could be equally effective in lowly resourced contexts, specifically in efforts to achieve the health-related Millennium Development goals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception and use of mobile phones as educational and professional tools by nurses in lowly resourced settings. METHODOLOGY: A quantitative survey using self-administered questionnaires was conducted of rural advanced midwives. RESULTS: Fifty-six nurses (49.6%) from the 113 rural-based midwives attending an advanced midwifery training programme at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, filled in a questionnaire. The results showed that, whilst nurses regarded their technology competences as low and although they received very little official support from their educational and professional institutions, the majority frequently used mobile functions and applications to support their work and learning processes. They perceived mobile devices with their voice, text, and email functions as important tools for the educational and professional activities of searching for information and engaging with facilitators and peers from work and study contexts. To a lesser extent, the use of social networks, such as WhatsApp and Facebook, were also reported. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: It is concluded that educational institutions should support the appropriate use of mobile phones more systematically; particularly in relation to the development of mobile network literacy skills.

%X Introduction: Reduced physical function is one of the most prevalent sequelae in ICU survivors and directly increases demands on family caregivers, particularly following home discharge. We present the case of a 60 year-old woman who completed a 4-week in-home exercise program via a web-based telerehabilitation platform (VISYTER: Versatile and Integrated System for TeleRehabilitation). Case: This 60 year-old Caucasian woman has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and deep vein thrombosis. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient was discharged to home after being treated in the ICU for 15 days and in a stepdown unit for additional 21 days. The patient uses a walker and home oxygen. The 4-week in-home exercise program consisted of daily self-practice of prescribed home exercise and weekly interactive exercise session with an exercise physiologist (interventionist) via VISYTER. A family caregiver (29 year-old daughter) was asked to join the interactive instruction sessions as a partner, learn exercise regimens and assist the patient during daily self-exercise as needed. Home exercise consisted of (1) warm up, (2) walking, (3) resistance exercise using an elastic band for upper body and extremities, (4) partner exercise with a caregiver using a weight ball and seated volley ball and (5) cool down. The patient was asked to keep a daily exercise diary and, monitor blood pressure, heart rates and SpO2 before, during and after the exercise. During weekly VISYTER sessions, the interventionist reviewed patient's exercise diary to check progress in exercise, had the patient demonstrate prescribed exercise and modified exercise regimen if necessary. Each session took an average of 38 minutes. No adverse events were reported. As concurrent usual care, the patient received home physical therapy for three weeks (twice a week for initial two weeks and once a week for one week) and three visits from home care nurses. After completing the 4-week program, all outcome measures showed trends of positive change except worsening depressive symptoms in the caregiver. Both patient and caregiver mentioned the intervention was highly acceptable and engaging. Discussion: This case report suggests delivering an in-home exercise program via telerehabilitation may be a feasible and acceptable way to engage ICU survivors after home discharge. Adding data from more participants is necessary to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability to propose a larger efficacy trial.

%X Development of virtual-reality medical applications is usually a complicated and labour intensive task. This paper explores the feasibility of using commodity physics engine to develop a suturing simulator prototype for manual skills training in the fields of nursing and medicine, so as to enjoy the benefits of rapid development and hardware-accelerated computation. In the prototype, spring-connected boxes of finite dimension are used to simulate soft tissues, whereas needle and thread are modelled with chained segments. Spherical joints are used to simulate suture's flexibility and to facilitate thread cutting. An algorithm is developed to simulate needle insertion and thread advancement through the tissue. Two-handed manipulations and force feedback are enabled with two haptic devices. Experiments on the closure of a wound show that the prototype is able to simulate suturing procedures at interactive rates. The simulator is also used to study a curvature-adaptive suture modelling technique. Issues and limitations of the proposed approach and future development are discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

%X Nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is a common clinical procedure where a plastic tube is inserted into the stomach through the nostril for feeding or drainage. However, the placement is a blind process in which the tube may be mistakenly inserted into other locations, leading to unexpected complications or fatal incidents. The placement techniques are conventionally acquired by practising on unrealistic rubber mannequins or on humans. In this paper, a virtual reality based training simulation system is proposed to facilitate the training of NGT placement. It focuses on the simulation of tube insertion and the rendering of the feedback forces with a haptic device. A hybrid force model is developed to compute the forces analytically or numerically under different conditions, including the situations when the patient is swallowing or when the tube is buckled at the nostril. To ensure real-time interactive simulations, an offline simulation approach is adopted to obtain the relationship between the insertion depth and insertion force using a non-linear finite element method. The offline dataset is then used to generate real-time feedback forces by interpolation. The virtual training process is logged quantitatively with metrics that can be used for assessing objective performance and tracking progress. The system has been evaluated by nursing professionals. They found that the haptic feeling produced by the simulated forces is similar to their experience during real NGT insertion. The proposed system provides a new educational tool to enhance conventional training in NGT placement.

%X Background and Purpose: Malnutrition is a major cause of death and disability among infants and children.1 An important reason behind failure of malnutrition management is limited knowledge and competency of health professionals.2 It is imperative that their capacity is developed. One way to achieve this is to provide health professionals with standardised and accessible training on malnutrition management. To achieve this, the IMTF and Faculty of Medicine eLearning at the University of Southampton have developed an eLearning course called 'Caring for infants and children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)'. Designed based on the WHO's guidelines, it provides standardised and interactive learning in 3 modules - core concepts, identification and management. Although rich in media, the course is created to run on a low spec computer with a limited internet speed to enable its access in both developed and developing countries. By completing it the user will gain the core knowledge and competencies for SAM management. Methodology: In collaboration with the Uganda Paediatric Association (UPA), a study was conducted in Uganda in December 2010 to evaluate the effectiveness of the course and appropriateness of its delivery. Eight-six, including doctors, medical students, nurses and nutritionists, participated in 3 half-days training. The study was planned through email correspondences between the UK project team and UPA. Four members of the project team came to Uganda to make the final arrangement and to conduct the study. Using pre and post tests and questionnaires, observation, individual interviews and focus groups, the participants' experience during the study were investigated. Results: Overall the course was well received for its design and delivery. However, the study presented a challenge in designing open and accessible medical resources. The course piloted is accessible through a registration requiring user email as their ID. However, one third, mainly nurses, neither had email accounts nor used a computer before. Only 14 out of 35 interviewed had computers and 8 had internet access. Google, PubMed and eMedicine were used by those who used internet for learning, but none had used an open educational resources repository. When tried to access medical resources from repositories, most were not 'accessible' due to limited internet speed. Discussion and Conclusions: This study presents us a question of what 'open' and 'accessible' medical resources are. What are accessible and open in developed countries may not be the same elsewhere; therefore, not open or accessible to them. To share a medical resource, we need to create it accessible and open to all, and this means we should consider the user environment.

%X Background & Hypothesis: Keloid scars can cause itch and pain due to stimulation of small nerve fibres as part of the scar healing process. Due to the itch and pain caused by keloids, it is important to assess patient pain score both before and after injections. Hence, we sought to standardise the nursing pain assessment, and understand pain scores and management of patients undergoing injections for keloids. Methods: A survey of nurses was conducted at prestandardisation and poststandardisation of the pain assessment. A standardised pain reporting method was developed, and nurses were trained using pep talks and e-learning. Poststandardisation, nursing audits were carried out to assess the adherence of staff. Preprocedural and postprocedural pain assessments were obtained using electronic medical records. Results: A survey of 40 nurses was conducted in June 2013 and June 2014. Poststandardisation, there was a 50% increase in nurses obtaining prepain score (prestandardisation: 50%, poststandardisation:100%). There was a 25% increase in nurses (prestandardisation: 50%, poststandardisation: 75%) obtaining postprocedural pain score using the standardised pain assessment method (2 to 5 minutes after procedure). Nursing audit was conducted on 40 procedures (16 nurses) poststandardisation from September 2013 to December 2013; 92.5% of them obtained prepain score, and 100% obtained postpain score 2 to 5 minutes after procedure. From electronic medical records, no significant differences were found in patient characteristic, pre and postintervention pain scores, and pain management techniques. Discussion & Conclusion: A standardised pain assessment is necessary to ensure consistency of care delivery. Nursing education and audits are essential to ensure that nurses are aware of the standard pain assessment methods.

%X Objective. Changes in the recommendations for initiation of cervical cancer screenings is supported by a large body of evidence surrounding the natural history of HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infections and the minor burden of cervical cancer in female adolescents. However, a significant proportion of health care providers surveyed do not routinely implement the evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, a web-based continuing-education program for advanced practice nurses (APNs) was developed to encourage the uptake of the evidence into practice. Methods. Findings from a needs assessment survey were incorporated into a free, eLearning program on the New Jersey Forum of Nurses in Advanced Practice website. Pre and post-tests were administered during the program along with a post-program survey for the course and speaker evaluation. Lastly, a post-program survey was emailed to participants during the week of January 31st, 2011 to February 7th, 2011, to determine if practice improvement( s) occurred as a result of the program. Results. A Paired-samples t tests were computed to measure differences in means across pre- and postprograms scores. The results indicated that mean postprogram scores (M = 6.02, SD = 1.20), were significantly lower than the mean pre-test scores (M = 7.12, SD = 1.87), t(39) = 4.40, p < .00. (A score of 5 was a perfect score: A score of 10 indicated all incorrect answers). Overall, the participants rated the program as good to excellent. Conclusions. Implications for advance-practice nursing: This program was designed to allowing greater flexibility for the participants to increase their knowledge of the evidence-based guidelines. By altering their clinical practice patterns, APNs can decrease the burdens associated with over-screening for cervical cancer in female adolescents: a population that has a high rate of HPV infection, but an extremely low incidence of cervical cancer.

%X BACKGROUND: Continuous nursing education (CNE) courses delivered through e-learning is believed to be an effective mode of learning for nurses. Implementation of e-learning modules requires pre-assessment of infrastructure and learners' characteristics. Understanding the learners' needs and their perspectives would facilitate effective e-learning delivery by addressing the underlying issues and providing necessary support to learners. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine access to computer and Internet facilities, interest in and preferences regarding e-learning, and attitudes toward e-learning among nurses in Peninsular Malaysia. DESIGN: The study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive survey. SETTING: Government hospitals and community clinics in four main regions of Peninsular Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 300 registered nurses. METHOD: Data were collected using questionnaires, which consisted of demographic and background items and questions on access to computer and Internet facilities, interest and preferences in e-learning, and attitudes toward e-learning. Descriptive analysis and a chi-squared test were used to identify associations between variables. RESULTS: Most Malaysian nurses had access to a personal or home computer (85.3%, n=256) and computer access at work (85.3%, n=256). The majority had Internet access at home (84%, n=252) and at work (71.8%, n=215); however, average hours of weekly computer use were low. Most nurses (83%, n=249) did not have an e-learning experience but were interested in e-learning activities. Most nurses displayed positive attitudes toward e-learning. Average weekly computer use and interest in e-learning were positively associated with attitudes toward e-learning. CONCLUSION: Study findings suggest that organizational support is needed to promote accessibility of information and communications technology (ICT) facilities for Malaysian nurses to motivate their involvement in e-learning.

%X Purpose: A cross sectional descriptive study, which involved government hospitals and health clinics from Peninsular Malaysia sought to identify the continuing professional education (CPE) needs and their readiness for E-learning. This paper focuses on the first phase of that study that aimed to determine the factors that influence nurses' participation in CPE. Methods: Multistage cluster sampling was used to recruit 1,000 nurses randomly from 12 hospitals and 24 health clinics from four states in Peninsular Malaysia who agreed to be involved. The respondent rate was 792 (79.2%), of which 562 (80%) had participated in CPE in the last 12 months. Results: Findings suggested that updating knowledge and providing quality care are the most important factors that motivate participation in CPE, with respective means of 4.34 and 4.39. All the mean scores for educational opportunity were less than 3.0. Chi-square tests were used to test the association of demographic data and CPE participation. All demographical data were significantly associated with CPE participation, except marital status. Conclusions: Implementation of mandatory CPE is considered an important measure to increase nurse's participation in CPE. However, effective planning that takes into consideration the learning needs of nurses is recommended. © 2011 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

%X Nursing education must keep up with the rapidly changing medical landscape to support the competences of nurses in the areas of critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity. Problem-based learning (PBL) provides an appropriate strategy for nursing education innovation. Nursing curricula based on PBL remain in the growing stage in Taiwan. Kaohsiung Medical University introduced PBL into nursing education in 2002. The critical events in the process included: (1) nurturing key tutors; (2) using PBL teaching methods in an elective course - Oncology Nursing, and designing a new elective course - Symposiums Regarding Clinical Cases; (3) holding conferences inside and outside the school to promote PBL teaching methods; (4) linking e-learning and PBL teaching methods; (5) conducting PBL research; (6) establishing a committee of PBL, objective structured clinical examination, and teaching material review for the College of Nursing; and (7) setting up a required course - Nursing Ethics. We now have 12 key tutors in the College of Nursing. We have also completed two studies to evaluate the ability of students and to explore the experience of tutors. From our studies, we know that PBL can increase learner abilities in self-directed learning, critical thinking, and PBL performance. The approach helps students to cope with the changing medical landscape. Furthermore, tutors and teachers develop adequate PBL teaching skills. Based on the experience above, we believe that we are on the right path in terms of continuing tutor development, gradually increasing the number of PBL courses, and undertaking further research to promote PBL methods in Taiwan. © 2009 Elsevier.

%X Introduction: The admission to the Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of sepsis and/or septic shock is not uncommon. The aim of this article is to present a nursing case review of a patient admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of septic shock and the use of bedside acid-base formulae to inform clinical decision making. Method: We chose to use a case review. This method is useful in reporting unusual or rare cases and is typically seen more in medicine than in nursing. Discussion: The gentleman in question was a self-presentation with a short history of fever and worsening shortness of breath. His condition worsened where he required admission to the intensive care unit. The use of 'advanced' acid-base interpretation to guide his nursing care provided a platform from which to advance a deeper understanding of the intricacies the critically ill patient often presents. Conclusion: The use of case review is enlightening in understanding the disease process and the decision-making that accompanies this. The lessons learnt are applicable to a wider nursing audience because understanding acid-base physiology is beneficial in supporting and advancing critical care nursing practice. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Introduction: Studies have shown that higher levels of teamwork improve nursing satisfaction in acute care units. Positive relationships among all care providers have been shown to improve quality of patient care and job satisfaction. Other studies have shown that stress resiliency influences job satisfaction by influencing job stress and psychological empowerment. The purpose of this project was to develop a training platform for nursing staff education and teambuilding. Program objectives included improving nurse satisfaction, increasing resiliency, building unit cohesion, enhancing morale and increasing staff awareness of unit performance. Methods: All staff members were given an eight hour “training” day; half of the day was devoted to lecture/education while the other half focused on team building and resiliency. Training was provided by various guest speakers and lecturers, as well as unit leadership. At the end of the day, participants were encouraged to complete an evaluation and all activities were scored on a 10-point Likert scale, with 10 representing the most informative. Results: Participants scored the activities very high, with a total average score of 9.15 (n=246). The activity that scored the highest was a discussion on unit performance metrics, with a score of 9.50 (n=41). The activity that rated the lowest was a computer teambuilding session, at 8.83 (n=41). Overall, staff agreed that the training day both increased awareness of unit performance (9.41, n=41) and unit cohesion/healthy work environment (9.56, n=41). Conclusions: The staff development day was a success and plans are underway to make the program a biannual event. The first event met our objectives of building unit cohesion and increasing satisfaction and morale. Many staff members commented that they are looking forward to the next training event. Applicability of Research to Practice: Teamwork and resiliency are essential for the successful functioning of inpatient units, especially in the high-stress, military and burn environment. “Staff Development Day” can be a successful training platform for improving these skills. Future research could build on this pilot project to adapt the framework for other units.

%X For many acute care nursing units, such as the Burn Progressive Care Unit (BPCU) at the U.S. Army Burn center, staff stress and burnout is always a concern for leaders. Job stress not only contributes to nursing turnover, but can have a negative impact on patient care. The purpose of this project was to develop a training platform for nursing staff education and teambuilding with the intent of improving nurse satisfaction, increasing resiliency, building unit cohesion, enhancing morale, and increasing staff awareness of unit performance. All nursing staff were given an 8-hour training day, half of which was focused on education and the other half on teambuilding and resiliency. At the end of the staff development day (SDD), participants were encouraged to complete an evaluation; all activities were scored on a 10-point scale, with 10 representing the most informative. In total, 46 of 48 staff (96%) participated in the first two SDDs. During the first iteration (Spring 2015), participants scored all activities very high, with a total average score of 9.15 ± 0.26 (n = 246). In the Fall of 2015, the SDD program was again rated well, with an average score of 9.36 ± 0.13 (n = 276). The SDD program has been successful in supporting teamwork and resiliency among BPCU staff. Staff feedback supported success in meeting the objectives of building unit cohesion and increasing satisfaction and morale.

%X Background: Educating patients about receiving surgical procedures is becoming an important issue, as it can reduce anxiety and uncertainty while helping to hasten decisions for undergoing time sensitive surgeries. We evaluated a new integrated education model for patients undergoing cervical disc herniation surgery using a quasi-experimental design. Methods: The participants were grouped into either the new integrated educational model (n = 32) or the standard group (n = 32) on the basis of their ward numbers assigned at admission. Anxiety, uncertainty, and patient satisfaction were measured before (pre-test) and after the educational intervention (post-test-1) and post-surgery (post-test-2) to assess the effectiveness of the model in this intervention. Results: We found that the generalized estimating equation modeling demonstrated this new integrated education model was more effective than the conventional model in reducing patients' anxiety and uncertainty (p < 0.05). Patients were also more satisfied with our newly developed model as it takes a more holistic approach to individual health. Conclusion: This novel systemic educational model enhances patient's understanding of the medical condition and surgery while promoting patient-caregiver interaction for optimal patient health outcomes. We present a comprehensive and consistent platform for educational purposes in patients undergoing surgery as well as reducing the psychological burden from anxiety and uncertainty. Integrating medicine, nursing, and new technologies into an e-practice and e-learning platform offers the potential of easier understanding and usage. It could revolutionize patient education in the future.

%X The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance imposes limitations on successful treatment of infection and also has a significant socioeconomic impact. Emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms and their rapid intercontinental spread, as well as a lack of new antibiotics in the developmental pipeline, have led all stakeholders to take action. Despite reduced consumption of antimicrobials and improvement in appropriate use of antibiotics during the past decade in Korea, such efforts should be further enhanced and an increase in public awareness is needed. A public campaign for 'appropriate antibiotic use' was launched in Korea in November 2011. This campaign, organized by the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and the Korean Society for Chemotherapy, and sponsored by the Korea CDC, the Korean Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, and the Asia Pacific Foundation for Infectious Diseases, has targeted both members of the general public and healthcare professionals. Contents include development and distribution of posters, leaflets, and e-learning programs, education of school nurses, leading to indirect education of students, and mass media campaigns. We hope that this campaign will contribute to an increase in public awareness and that it will encourage both members of the general public and healthcare professionals to join in the effort to overcome a crisis of antimicrobial resistance. © 2012 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases.

%X Introduction. Pharmacology teaching is an ongoing challenge for the teacher and students, in order to achieve that knowledge and motivation to persist. The aim of this paper is the incorporation of games as a teaching strategy (Ulrich D., et al. J of Nursing Education 2005;44:338-339) in pharmacology classes, through the development of a material called Pharmapoly. Materials. Using the principles of the game called Monopoly, I have developed a board with eighteen portraits of famous pharmacologists due to their discoveries. Cards and dices to play are related to the area of pharmacology. Each pharmacologist has assigned several questions related to the topics of research and development, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which must be answered correctly by students to advance and finish with the highest number of pharmacologists in their possession. Results. During the 1st half of 2009 it was made a pilot with 43 students of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Los Andes in Colombia, with the module of pharmacodynamics. The comments at the end of the module by students were: 1. It was fun, 2. We have learned a lot, and 3. We want to continue playing and learning. Conclusion. The teaching of pharmacology can be facilitated by the incorporation of methodologies such as educational games, which complement any teaching activity and generate continuous motivation in students.

%X The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that web-based synchronous instruction utilizing Multi-user Virtual World Environments (MUVEs) increases student engagement compared to traditional asynchronous learning methods. In a quasi-experimental two group posttest only study, a sample of Family Nurse Practitioner students (n = 21) received instruction using either a synchronous (n = 10) or asynchronous (n = 11) learning method. Engagement was measured using the Community of Inquiry survey. Results indicated that engagement scores were significantly higher for the synchronous learning platform (mean = 3.61, SD = 1.13) compared to the asynchronous learning platform (mean = 3.49, SD = 1.08, t(1766) = -2.21, p < 0.05). Increased student engagement with synchronous MUVE platforms have the potential to improve learning outcomes and offer nursing students a multitude of educational opportunities to practice new skills and behaviors in real life scenarios, all within the safety of a controlled environment.

%X This paper outlines a small action research work-based study. Its aim was to ascertain the content of an e-learning resource designed to help student children and young people's (CYP) nurses promote young children's mental health. Recent policy stresses the importance of this area of health promotion. The setting for the study was a higher education institution and the data collection methods were a focus group and semi-structured interviews.The key stakeholders involved in the study were four student CYP nurses, a child health programme leader, a child health lecturer, a child and adolescent mental health lecturer and an e-learning expert.The results suggest that attachment theory, assessment framework and Bronfenbrenner's ecology model should be included in the learning resource in order to promote a holistic approach toward young children's mental health promotion. Further research is required into what training is required for student CYP nurses regarding child mental health and how CYP nurses can be prepared for their role in skill-mixed health visiting teams.

%X In June 2010, the Department of Health (DoH), UK released a call to apply for funding to support projects focused on benefiting the lives of children and young people with palliative and complex health care needs. The Faculty of Health & Life Sciences in Coventry University, England (led by Professor Jane Coad) was awarded ≤1.4 million to develop and deliver a new and innovative accredited blended e.learningprogrammein conjunction with Centre for Education and Learning Excellence (CELE) (led by Professsor Lynn Clouder and team). This innovative programme, for nurses, doctors and allied health and social care professionals, has the potential to nationally and internationally impact on learning in this field. The suite of seven new online modules can be taken as stand-alone units of learning or a Post Graduate Certificate. Blended learning includes a combination of new e-learning materials including video films, trigger case studies and second life avatars. Materials were developed and piloted by a new partnership approach of academics, expert clinical staff and Learning Technologists. The modules are contemporary in content focusing on the palliative, complex care needs and end of life care of the neonate through to the child and young person. The impact on the families is of high importance and considered throughout all of the modules. The presentation will share some of the new materials but will focus on our learning and experiences. We will critically explore our development and delivery of online resources reflecting on the following: Overcoming the challenges of enabling access to health professionals who lead busy, complex and time constrained lives wherever they are based. We will share how we developed efficient and flexible access to learning materials, experts and communities to deliver the programme. How we developed creative new partnerships of academics, expert clinical staff and Learning Technologists in order to deliver and develop materials. This included management strategies in order to ensure that effective elearning could take place. The potential impact on the field of paediatrics and child health internationally Lessons can be learnt from the experiences encountered by the team at Coventry University in the areas of consultation, innovation, design, construction and development of an e-learning programme. Delegates may benefit from the lessons and challenges faced as it may assist in their own developments and use of e- learning.

%X Background: Previous emergency transport studies have focused on the outcome benefits for the child when transported by specialist teams. However, there is a paucity of literature examining the lived experience of nurses and doctors, who may not have worked together previously and are consistently expected to practise in unfamiliar and stressful environments. Aim: This study was intended to describe and bring meaning to the experiences of those nurses and doctors stabilising and transporting critically ill children between facilities in the South East of England. Study outcomes would be used to inform future preparation and training for the role. Results: Transport personnel require more than perfunctory placement together. Syn- ergistic team working, relationship building and prof essional equality were identified as critical if they were to be able to apply their skills in an efficient and harmonious way. Advanced practice among the retrieval nurses was clearly demonstrated through their knowledge base, confidence and leadership and required both independent and joint decision making at critical junctures. Familiarising the 'unfamiliar' was crucial to the working environment where collaboration and compromise within the team were closely linked. Conclusions: Emergency transport teams would benefit from a greater understanding of team dynamics and how to effectively influence that relationship. Team building needs to be intentional if team perspective is to be understood and unified. Adopting the cognitive concepts of crew resource management within interprof essional training, would further strengthen the retrieval service's team-building framework, creating the platform in which to apply their clinical skills effectively and efficiently.

%X Purpose: Early, high quality, chest compressions are a primary goal during Quick Response Team interventions, however team start-up seems to cause successive distractions from nurse initiated BLS. In 2012 we altered LUCAS-2 implementation to “a.s.a.p. placement” the 1st minutes of team tasking instead of after “optimization of manual BLS”. Our hypothesis was that early use of the LUCAS-2 could be done within 20 s, in ≥95% of cases. Delays have predictable causes. Materials and methods: Analysis of the last 50 cases using MRx monitor data, supervisor observations and hospital records complemented by an unannounced check of certified nurses in deployment scenarios. Results and discussion: The LUCAS-2 was used in 80% of resuscitations. Training (E-learning, hands-on training) was 92% for the 67 “q-nurse” potentially tasked for placement. Initial placement was in 5-20 s (median 13 s) of BLS interruption, using a two stop approach. In only 35% of the cases the LUCAS-2 was applied immediately upon start-up. Significant confounders in placement were: failure to turn-on early add 6-20 s; idem + error due to internal check add 8-17 s; delay due to clothes +6-22 s; back-board positioning +9-24 s; and required repositioning on chest +5-35 s. In real time set-up of the Lucas-2 system required circa 10±25 s. The most frequently occurring serious delay was back boardto- compression unit clamping failure, causing 4 cases of device “swing” upwards at initiation of compression. The otherwasovertly low placement on the sternum, requiring “tugging” upwards. The most costly in time was clothing issues requiring understanding of the issue, clamping and side-to-side check. This confounder is directly related to nurse exposure and time since training. Our data support other findings seeing human factors as the root cause in delays. Conclusions: The LUCAS-2 can be placed early within 10±25 s if confounders are anticipated and avoided and nurses being trained sufficiently.

%X The Christie Clinic is a specialist centre for the treatment of cancer located in Manchester, UK. Developed as a joint partnership between HCA international, the UK's largest provider of private healthcare and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. The Christie NHS Stem Cell Transplant Programme performs around 100 allogeneic and autologous transplants a year, making it one of the largest units in the UK. It achieved full accreditation with the Joint Accreditation Committee for ISCT and EBMT (JACIE) in 2009. Actions: Opening a new unit has not been without its challenges. The first appointments were the senior sister and a clinical practice facilitator (CPF). The joint venture enabled the creation of two roles,the CPF and a nurse clinician. Both of these were working between the NHS and private facilities and were only possible due to the joint venture. The task of creating the right team was of upmost importance. Successful patient care depends on the whole workforce. Staff who are empowered, engaged and well supported provide better patient care (DOH 2009). The employment of motivated nurses already established within haematology practice was fundamental. There was further required training and competency to the Christie & HCA standards within tight time frames. It was essential to implement effective working practice to guide service development and improvement. The training and induction was scheduled within the Christie HTU, and HCA. Consultant clinics, clinical nurse specialists and nurse clinicians were all utilised, also scheduled time on the ward and day unit with the experienced haematology nurses. Theoretical training also provided using suitable educational materials including study days and e learning. Challenges: Relationships throughout the Christie Trust and also HCA needed to be established. The joint venture was a new change and changes can sometimes cause problems and concerns. Good communication was essential in bridging the gap between the NHS and private, through regular meetings with the senior consultants who were part of the new venture. This in turn gave us the opportunity to develop links with the Christie haematology and transplant team. Conclusion: Through excellent team work the senior sister and the CPF have a small team of nurses who can deliver the highest standard in this new and specialised area. Working within The Christie and HCA provides a unique opportunity for staff in this joint venture.

%X The purpose of this study was to describe sets of nursing concepts including, for example, nursing diagnoses and interventions, which are knowledge-based and clinically relevant to support nursing practice. Health information systems using the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP®) provide a platform for standardized nursing documentation for patients' health care, clinical decision support, and repositories for re-use of clinical data for quality evaluation, research, management decisions and policy development. Clinically relevant sets of ICNP concepts can facilitate implementation of health information systems for nursing. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the types of, and relationships among, existing nursing content sets. Findings included the need for various types of content sets, as represented in ICNP catalogues, for nursing documentation. Five types of ICNP Catalogues included Care Plans, Order Sets, Clinical Templates, Nursing Minimum Data Sets, and Terminology Subsets.

%X Spirituality or religiousness is important across the health trajectory, from promoting health and preventing disease, to coping with illness and end of life. Research on the relationship of religiousness or spirituality to health spans more than one discipline and applies many definitions and measures. The purpose of this multidisciplinary work is to facilitate research by nurses who seek to investigate the relationship between health and religiousness or spirituality, and provide evidence-based guidance for nursing practice. Senior researchers summarize the history of inquiry on this topic, discuss particular and persistent challenges posed by definitions of religion and spirituality, describe selected measures that have enjoyed wide application, and make recommendations for consideration by nurse researchers. Use of existing knowledge to select variables, definitions, and measures, and to link research questions and findings to the larger body of current inquiry, will advance nursing practice closer to fulfilling Nightingale's ideals for effective care. © The Author(s) 2012.

%X Building the science for nursing practice has never been more important. However, shrunken federal and state research budgets mean that investigators must find alternative sources of financial support and develop projects that are less costly to carry out. New investigators often build beginning programs of research with limited funding. This article provides an overview of some cost-effective research approaches and gives suggestions for finding other sources of funding. Examples of more cost-effective research approaches include adding complementary questions to existing funded research projects; conducting primary analysis of electronic patient records and social media content; conducting secondary analysis of data from completed studies; reviewing and synthesizing previously completed research; implementing community-based participatory research; participating in collaborative research efforts such as inter-campus team research, practice-based research networks (PBRNs), and involving undergraduate and doctoral students in research efforts. Instead of relying on funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies, nurse researchers may be able to find support for research from local sources such as businesses, organizations, or clinical agencies. Investigators will increasingly have to rely on these and other creative approaches to fund and implement their research programs if granting agency budgets do not significantly expand.

%X Educators increasingly use virtual patients (computerized clinical case simulations) in health professions training. The authors summarize the effect of virtual patients compared with no intervention and alternate instructional methods, and elucidate features of effective virtual patient design. The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsychINFO, and Scopus through February 2009 for studies describing virtual patients for practicing and student physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Reviewers, working in duplicate, abstracted information on instructional design and outcomes. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Four qualitative, 18 no-intervention controlled, 21 noncomputer instruction-comparative, and 11 computer-assisted instruction-comparative studies were found. Heterogeneity was large (I2>50%) in most analyses. Compared with no intervention, the pooled effect size (95% confidence interval; number of studies) was 0.94 (0.69 to 1.19; N=11) for knowledge outcomes, 0.80 (0.52 to 1.08; N=5) for clinical reasoning, and 0.90 (0.61 to 1.19; N=9) for other skills. Compared with noncomputer instruction, pooled effect size (positive numbers favoring virtual patients) was -0.17 (-0.57 to 0.24; N=8) for satisfaction, 0.06 (-0.14 to 0.25; N=5) for knowledge, -0.004 (-0.30 to 0.29; N=10) for reasoning, and 0.10 (-0.21 to 0.42; N=11) for other skills. Comparisons of different virtual patient designs suggest that repetition until demonstration of mastery, advance organizers, enhanced feedback, and explicitly contrasting cases can improve learning outcomes. Virtual patients are associated with large positive effects compared with no intervention. Effects in comparison with noncomputer instruction are on average small. Further research clarifying how to effectively implement virtual patients is needed.

The UK Paediatric Cardiac Nurses Association worked with other groups to explore the feasibility of a national multi-professional paediatric cardiac education pathway. Three options were identified, including the continuation of local in-house provision with its associated variation in standards. The relative benefits and resource implications of each option were explored and approaches made to educational institutions for support in developing the pathway. A university with an established reputation for e-learning undertook this development and a post graduate certificate in Paediatric Cardiothoracic Practice will soon be available.

%X Calls for greater collaboration between professionals in health and social care have led to pressures to move toward interprofessional education (IPE) at both pre- and post-registration levels. Whilst this move has evolved out of "common sense" demands, such a multiple systems approach to education does not fit easily into existing traditional educational frameworks and there is, as yet, no proven theoretical framework to guide its development. A research study of an IPE intervention at the University of Liverpool in the UK drew on complexity theory to conceptualize the intervention and to evaluate its impact on a group of ∼500 students studying physiotherapy, medicine, occupational therapy, nursing and social work. The intervention blended a multidisciplinary (non-interactive) plenary with self-directed e-learning and a series of interdisciplinary (interactive) workshops. Two evaluations took place: the first when the workshops were facilitated by trained practitioners; the second when the practitioners co-facilitated with trained service users. This paper reports findings from the second evaluation which focused on narrowing the gap between theory and practice. A multi-stakeholder evaluation was used including: students' reflective narratives, a focus group with practitioners and individual semi-structured interviews with service users. Findings showed that service users can make an important contribution to IPE for health and social care students in the early stages of their training. By exposure to a service user perspective, first year students can begin to learn and apply the principles of team work, to place the service user at the centre of the care process, to make connections between theory and "real life" experiences, and to narrow the gap between theory and practice. Findings also revealed benefits for facilitators and service users.

%X An evidence-based interprofessional educational (IPE) intervention involving first year undergraduate students studying medicine, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy was piloted at the University of Liverpool. Campbell's phased approach and Complexity Theory guided development of the intervention and its evaluation. The intervention included a staff-training programme, e-learning materials and interprofessional team working skills workshops. A multi method study design was used to evaluate outcomes and the processes by which the outcomes had transpired. The first year cohort of students (n = 442) was invited to attend the pilots. Fifty-four per cent (n = 237) opted to attend. Findings showed that the intervention promoted theoretical learning about team working. It enabled the students to learn with and from each other (p < 0.001), it significantly raised awareness about collaborative practice (p < 0.05), and its link to improving the effectiveness of care delivery (p < 0.01). The qualitative data showed that it served to increase students' confidence in their own professional identity and helped them to value difference making them better prepared for clinical placement. The findings support the need to start IPE early in students' training before professional doctrines have been built into their learning. As a result of the findings, the intervention has become compulsory for students to attend and the project has evolved to include trained service users/carers as co-facilitators of the workshops. It is also working on strengthening e-learning by integrating the generic materials into the curricula of all courses. Alongside this, strategies are being explored for interprofessional learning in practice. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

%X OBJECTIVE: Use of electronic communication has increased dramatically during the last five years. This is true even for the healthcare industry. We undertook this study to understand how fertility practices communicate with their patients in this electronic age, specifically targeting email and social network interactions. DESIGN: Prospective survey of physicians, practice managers and nurses using Survey Monkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 160 surveys were sent to reproductive medicine practices. 93 (53.1%) responded, including 34 practice managers (36.6%), 31 MD's (33.3%), 9 nurses (9.7%) and 19 others (20.4%). Survey Monkey was used to assemble data. Chi-squared was used for analysis. RESULTS: 35/160 (37.6%) were from practices of 50 employees or larger. Email contact was used routinely in 153/160 (92.4%) of practices. 89.2% cited “ease of communication for patients” as a major advantage, while 80.2% reported “documentation of communication” as an advantage. More than half expressed that disadvantages included expectation of quick response and privacy issues. Nurses who responded expressed concern regarding the possibility of misinterpretation of medical information. 52.3% used Facebook, followed by blogging (30.7%), twitter (26.1%) and LinkedIn (12.5%). Those who used social networking reported it provided an opportunity to connect with patients and could generate new patient volume. The downsides were felt to be difficulties with maintenance (64.4%), issues related to providing medical information (51.1%), and issues around crossing boundaries between patients and physicians/medical staff (80.2%). CONCLUSION: A high percentage of reproductive medicine practices are using email to communicate with patients and social media for marketing. This survey provides insight into the positive aspects of new media as well as to potential challenges it brings to reproductive medicine practices. Clinics may benefit from shared best practices regarding privacy, liability and other concerns about electronic communication with patients.

%X Patient simulation is increasingly used in the education of healthcare providers, yet few studies have compared simulation to other teaching modalities. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in knowledge acquisition and student satisfaction between two methods of teaching the principles of mechanical ventilation to advanced practice nursing (APN) students: high-fidelity patient simulation (including face-to-face instruction) versus an online, narrated PowerPoint presentation. Twenty APN students were randomized to either the simulation or online teaching method in this pre/posttest study. Measures included a 12-item knowledge questionnaire and a 5-item satisfaction survey. Both groups had significant improvement in knowledge scores from pretest to posttest, but knowledge scores were not significantly different at posttest between groups. Student satisfaction with their learning method was significantly higher in the simulation group. Students choosing to participate in the alternative teaching method after study completion preferred the simulation to the online method.

%X Introduction: Rapidly advancing technology, increasing ethnic diversity and the emerging recognition of nursing as a vital international resource, implies a need for a variety of curricula opportunities. Purpose: To provide opportunities for transcultural learning and enable students to advance their cultural awareness, knowledge and nursing care practices in line with international trends. Material-Methods: The applicants were delighted to meet their international partner during April 2010. Within the timetable for this visit there were planned meetings to discuss the opportunities for shared learning for nursing students across both universities, whilst developing international links. Since July 2010, it is against this background that this new initiative has been developed between fifteen of our year 2 Child branch nursing students and fifteen year 3 students undertaking a 'Nursing Care of Children' module at other university. Results: Students from both universities were invited to engage in a care intervention (e.g. passing a feeding tube) based on a specific scenario involving three activities. At the end of this online learning experience students were able to: Recognise how cultural factors influence health and healthcare provision: Understand how principles of nursing practice are applied in each country. Discuss the importance of increasing their sensitivity towards another cultural group. Activity 1. Care intervention was visually recorded (over 20 minutes) and each participating student has been encouraged to reflect on performance using Carper's, Fundamental Patterns of Knowing (1978) as a framework for reflection. Activity 2. Both student groups had access to their specific recorded activity and under the direction of nurse lecturers forwarded to assigned student in each university using an online platform. Activity 3: Students continued to exchange dialogue with each other within a timeframe to identify areas for future professional learning. Experiences evaluated by nurse lecturers (July 2011) in perspective universities and significant outcomes are to be utilized for planning the advancement of this shared learning model. Conclusions: Evaluation and verbal feedback from students has been very positive, attracting further engagement in this exciting initiative.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Does the addition of video visits among Veterans receiving traditional primary care improve clinical outcomes, satisfaction and reduce cost of care? OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): To examine the impact of video visits, in addition to traditional primary care, on outpatient quality measures, healthcare utilization, cost and satisfaction among Veterans at 4 sites. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E. G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): The Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT), is a team-based approach to delivering patient-centered primary care with the aim of enhanced access and coordinated care management. Core PACT team members include the primary care provider, the registered nurse care manager, the clinical assistant and the clerical assistant. To date, PACT has successfully increased reliance on non-traditional means of accessing care, such as use of secure messaging and teleprimary care into a rural clinic setting. The “Video PACT” offers video encounters through clinical video technology (CVT) and web-based real time communication via mobile platform. Four sites were invite to participate. Each site identified two physicians as Video PACT providers. Veterans are selected for participation in the pilot by their PACT based on several criteria, including willingness to participate, ability to use a computer or tablet, and likelihood to benefit from the pilot (e.g. difficulty accessing care, frequent ER/hospital use, multiple comorbidities). Veterans are trained to use the tablet or computer software for the video visit and issued a tablet if needed. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): The first phase of this pilot assessed Veteran and provider experience of video visits by survey as well as clinical quality metrics, such as blood pressure; utilization of health services; and process measures like diabetes screening and receipt of vaccinations, obtained via chart review. The direct cost of video encounters was compared to face-toface encounters. FINDINGS TODATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TOSTATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): In the first phase of this pilot, 15 video encounters took place across 2 medical centers. Survey response rate was 71%. The mean age of participants was 65. The majority were white males. 71% had a diagnosis of PTSD or depression; 71% had hypertension; 57% had heart disease; 36% took opiates for chronic pain. A majority of patients were up to date with recommended vaccinations and screening for key chronic conditions. Overall, patients were very satisfied with their experience with video visits, with 90% opting for a repeat video visit, 90% willing to recommend video visits and 78% believing that it improved their access to care. The average cost for a video visit was $390, compared to $457 for a face-to-face visit. KEYLESSONS FORDISSEMINATION(WHATCAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Implementing video encounters presents a novel opportunity to enhance patient-centered care for organizations interested in leveraging technology to expand access in primary care. The findings to date from this pilot study suggest high levels of patient satisfaction for video visits and a lower cost of video visits compared to face-to-face visits.

%X Introduction: The Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) scheme continually make recommendations to improve patient safety through the development of effective educational strategies. A small scale educational research study (n = 8) aimed to explore the opinions of registered nurses on the contribution of the Better Blood Transfusion Continuing Education Programme (BBTCEP): Level 1 Safe Transfusion Practice e-learning course in meeting personal learning styles and learning needs. The exploration of knowledge transfer to practice identified the perceptions of future learning needs. Method A qualitative methodology was applied based on the principles of phenomenology. A purposive sampling plan supported the recruitment of participants who had successfully completed the e-learning course. Thematic analysis from the semistructured interviews identified common emerging themes. Results Participants based their opinions on their personal learning experiences as well as perceptions of future learning needs. Eight themes, which included numerous sub themes relating to learning styles, learning needs, learning approaches, course design, patient safety etc., emerged. Findings positively showed the e-learning course captures the learning styles and needs of learners. In particular, learning styles of a reflector, theorist and activist as well as a visual learner can actively engage in the online learning experience. Conclusion The findings of the small scale research study have shown the e-learning course does meet the diverse learning styles and needs of nurses working in a clinical transfusion environment. Furthermore, nurses recognise the importance of application of knowledge to practice and offer opinions on educational development strategies to bridge the theory practice gap and adopt a blended approach to learning. The results of the study will be considered by the editorial board of the BBTCEP as part of the educational review process, to meet the e-education needs of staff working within the healthcare setting.

%X Background: An international study between Denmark and Australia has built an understanding of family assessment practices by oncology nurses. This has provided a platform for further research exploring the oncology patient and family needs. The role of the family varies in different countries. In Australia, family is noted to provide close emotional and physical support. However in Denmark the family may form a less involved role often decided by the patient. The oncology nurse is the key point of contact for the patient and becomes the gatekeeper to inform tailored support. Aim: To investigate the oncology nurses' family assessment practices. Methods: An investigation of oncology nurses' family assessment practices was conducted. Focus groups [22] were conducted with oncology nurses in both Australia and Denmark [N = 62]. An interpretive analysis of transcribed audio data was conducted. Results: Nurses in Denmark and Australia valued family as part of the patient's care however assessment processes differed in relation to cultural concerns and health systems. In Denmark nurses formed the main aspect of support to the patient although the family was not always present. Whereas Australian nurses described their role as one to identify concerns from picking up on cues from the family and refer to a specialist. Both nationalities noted time and space for family assessment and level of experience and expertise influenced the nurse's role in family assessment. Nurses also identified that a structured approach may increase their ability to assess and provide support. Conclusions: The cultural aspect of family support influenced how the nurses engaged in family assessment. The hospital organization also influenced family assessment which may be difficult to change. The development of simple questions to engage the family may improve overall family support. A follow-on study is exploring the family needs during oncology care to understand what the family wants from the nurses.

%X The collection of perinatal data within Queensland, Australia, has traditionally been achieved via a paper form completed by midwives after each birth. Recently, with an increase in the use of e-health systems in healthcare, perinatal data collection has migrated to an online system. It is suggested that this move from paper to an ehealth platform has resulted in improvement to error rates, completion levels, timeliness of data transfer from healthcare institutions to the perinatal data collection and subsequent publication of data items. Worldwide, perinatal data are collected utilising a variety of methods, but essentially data are used for similar purposes: to monitor outcome patterns within obstetrics and midwifery. This paper discusses current practice in relation to perinatal data collection worldwide and within Australia, with a specific focus on Queensland, highlights relevant issues for midwives, and points to the need for further research into the efficient use of an e-health platform for perinatal data collection.

%X Human patient simulation (HPS) is used in health care education to enhance the transition from classroom learning to competent performance. It has been used frequently in nursing and medical schools and less often in pharmacy and other allied health professions. HPS is used to improve the development of pharmacy practice skills such as physical assessment, pharmacotherapy plan development, and monitoring plans. Engaging multiple health care disciplines in simulations enables participants to practice teamwork and communication skills that are essential in preventing errors and events of harm to patients. This article reviews current literature and use of simulation in pharmacy curricula for the development, enhancement, and assessment of pharmacy practice skills.

%X Introduction: Better Blood Transfusion (BBT) has well-established educational resources for training in safe transfusion practice. Staffs are now required to revalidate their transfusion training: the challenge is to engage with learners to maintain awareness and encourage revalidation. In August 2009 a short-term group was established within BBT to improve training figures in NHS Scotland Health Boards through the application of targeted communication strategies. Aim To devise, implement, review communication strategies and provide promotional tools to standardise and maximise efficacy of messaging by the BBT team relating to safe transfusion practice education. Method The group communicated via teleconference approx every four to six weeks, brainstorming and discussing how best to promote education and training of all staff involved in the transfusion process. A funding brief was submitted and approved by the Programme Director regarding the cost of overall implementation. Solutions developed were: Information for learners about why and how to undertake elearning modules Promotional communication tools Payslip messaging and email signature Key Slogans e.g. 'Education = Participation' and 'Train and Revalidate' Standardised letter templates BBT Newsletter and updated BBT Website Results The initial development and implementation of educational resources for training in safe transfusion practice has been successfully achieved by the BBT team. All NHS Boards agreed to insert a message in staff payslips in January and February 2010 which reminded staff of the importance of transfusion training and how to access it. Standard letter templates are available to TPs to communicate with Directors of Nursing/Medical Directors/Chief Executives highlighting the continued requirement for staff to revalidate transfusion training. Training figures for January- March 2010 indicate a 27% rise in valid learners compared with the same period in 2009. Conclusion It is challenging to ensure that learners are aware of why and how to engage with learning opportunities whilst supporting those who deliver training. The BBT team aim to ensure that educational resources and tools are available in NHS Scotland to support all staff to achieve transfusion training appropriate to their role.

%X Depression reduces quality of life for nursing home (NH) residents and places them at greater risk for disability, medical morbidity, and mortality. However, accumulating evidence suggests that interventions for early detection and treatment can mitigate symptoms of clinical and subclinical levels of depression. The Promoting Positive Well-Being (PPW) program is a quality improvement (QI) intervention that features tools and strategies to assist NHs in early identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of residents with depressive symptoms. The PPW was evaluated in 40 NHs through an 8-month QI collaborative that provided participants with tools, webinar training, and technical support. Results showed a significant group by time interaction effect with facility quality rating as a covariate; the active group (n = 18NHs) out performed the waitlist control group (n=19NHs). In all, there was a 58% relative reduction in the percentage of residents with self-reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Most NHs reported that theywere satisfied with the collaborative (97%) and would recommend it to others (86%); only 15% reported significant challenges. The rate of webinar attendance and data submission compliance was 92%. Results suggest that PPW is a promising approach that should be further evaluated in larger NH initiatives and other settings.

%X Australia's health workforce is facing significant challenges now and into the future. Health Workforce Australia (HWA) was established by the Council of Australian Governments as the national agency to progress health workforce reform to address the challenges of providing a skilled, innovative and flexible health workforce in Australia. HWA developed Australia's first major, long-term national workforce projections for doctors, nurses and midwives over a planning horizon to 2025 (called Health Workforce 2025; HW 2025), which provided a national platform for developing policies to help ensure Australia's health workforce meets the community's needs. A review of existing workforce planning methodologies, in concert with the project brief and an examination of data availability, identified that the best fit-for-purpose workforce planning methodology was the stock and flow model for estimating workforce supply and the utilisation method for estimating workforce demand. Scenario modelling was conducted to explore the implications of possible alternative futures, and to demonstrate the sensitivity of the model to various input parameters. Extensive consultation was conducted to test the methodology, data and assumptions used, and also influenced the scenarios selected for modelling. Additionally, a number of other key principles were adopted in developing HW 2025 to ensure the workforce projections were robust and able to be applied nationally. The findings from HW 2025 highlighted that a 'business as usual' approach to Australia's health workforce is not sustainable over the next 10 years, with a need for co-ordinated, long-term reforms by government, professions and the higher education and training sector for a sustainable and affordable health workforce. The main policy levers identified to achieve change were innovation and reform, immigration, training capacity and efficiency and workforce distribution. While HW 2025 has provided a national platform for health workforce policy development, it is not a one-off project. It is an ongoing process where HWA will continue to develop and improve health workforce projections incorporating data and methodology improvements to support incremental health workforce changes.

%X Objectives.- To make an educational leaflet on delirium available to all staff in an acute general hospital. To explore opinions on the usefulness of this form of educational media and its suitability for a clinical setting. Methods.- The leaflet was distributed in various sites around the hospital. A questionnairewas administered to a randomcrossection of twenty clinical staff. The staff included 15 NCHD'S (6 interns, 5 SHO'S and 4 Registrars) and 5 nurses (2 CNM's, 2 staff nurses and 1 student nurse). The Questionnaire ascertained their opinions on the leaflet, whether they found it useful and if clinical practice had changed. Results.- Seventy-two percent of staff found that the leaflets were located in a visible location. A third of participants found that it has led to a change in clinical practice, by helping in the on call work up of a delirious patient and by providing a broader list of causes of delirium to consider. Identified alternative ways that participants would also like to receive the information, on the hospital intranet, in the form of lecture and in a handbook. Conclusion.- Overall we found that the majority of staff found the leaflet easily accessible and its layout easy to read. One-third of participants felt it has changed their clinical practice We have identified alternative ways of educating staff on delirium and its management through the hospital intranet, lectures, and as part of a handbook. Our next steps are to expand this series into other topics, to examine objective evidence of learning (such as a reduced referral rates to the department of old age psychiatry and more appropriate prescribing in hospital), and to explore the possibility of developing an e learning module.

%X Aims: There is a need to upskill the clinical workforce in the field of rheumatology, so that consumers receive the right care at the right time1. Online delivery of professional education materials provides flexibility for ers and resource sustainability. The Rheumatology e-Learning program is an education program aimed at all health professionals to enhance their skills and knowledge in the management of musculoskeletal disease. Methods: The learning package was developed by consultation with a rheumatologist and rheumatology nurses and consists of seven non-sequential e-learning modules relating to immunology, pathophysiology, diagnosis/ clinical investigations, management, complications and psychology. The program can be accessed at www.ausrhpa.com/index.php. Rheumatology Health Professional Association membership (RHPA) is required to participate in the course. Results: A flexible and user-friendly e-learning programme in basic rheumatology is now available for health professionals. The learning modules have been endorsed by the RHPA and RCNA. Continuing Nurse Education (CNE) points are awarded on completion of each module. By highlighting the need for specific education, post graduate certificate is being developed. Conclusion: This resource adds to a developing web of professional development resources for musculoskeletal health and provides a foundation for more detailed, disease-specific resources, consistent with WA state policy for service delivery in inflammatory arthritis2.

%X Objective Situation awareness (SA) is a vital construct for decision making in intense, dynamic environments such as trauma resuscitation. Human patient simulation (HPS) allows for a safe environment where individuals can develop these skills. Trauma resuscitation is performed by multidisciplinary teams that are traditionally difficult to globally assess. Our objective was to create and validate a novel tool to measure SA in multidisciplinary trauma teams using a HPS - the Team Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (TSAGAT). Setting Memorial University Simulation Centre. Design/Participants Using HPS, 4 trauma teams completed 2 separate trauma scenarios. Student, junior resident, senior resident, and attending staff teams each had 3 members (trauma team leader, nurse, and airway manager). Individual SAGATs were developed by experts in each respective field and contained shared and complimentary knowledge questions. Teams were assessed with SAGAT in real time and with traditional checklists using video review. TSAGAT was calculated as the sum of individual SAGAT scores and was compared with the traditional checklist scores. Results Shared, complimentary, and TSAGAT scores improved with increasing team experience. Differences between teams for TSAGAT and complimentary knowledge were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean checklist differences between teams also reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). TSAGAT scores correlated strongly with traditional checklist scores (Pearson correlation r = 0.996). Interrater reliability for the checklist tool was high (Pearson correlation r = 0.937). Conclusion TSAGAT is the first valid and reliable assessment tool incorporating SA and HPS for multidisciplinary team performance in trauma resuscitation. TSAGAT could compliment or improve on current assessment methods and curricula in trauma and critical care and provides a template for team assessment in other areas of surgical education.

%X Background Nosocomial infections is both public health problem and financial question as the hospital's management is bear to the charges of the applied medicines, interventions and the increased average time nursing. If the multidrug-resistant organism causes the infection, the charges are multiplied. Purpose If the cleaning methods are inaccurate the pathogens are able to survive in the surrounding of the patient. Therefore keeping clean the patient touched surface is primary importance. The Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Hospital and Clinics started a hospital hygiene monitoring program in the interest of preventing and reducing nosocomial infections and increasing patient safety. Material and methods The measurement and evaluation (thoroughness of disinfection cleaning on critical surfaces) was in progress in EnCompass™ Environmental Monitoring System. In our hospital every step of the monitoring process carried out with pharmacist engagement. We used DAZO® Fluorescent marking gel on the high touched surfaces in the patient rooms and the patient bathrooms on 4 department of hospital. After the grace period the HTOs was checked with UV lamp. If the fluorescent mark remained visible the cleaning outcome was not adequate. The data collection and record was done on iPod (platform). In addition there is an online reporting portal, which suitable for individual reporting. Results The pilot study happened during November and December 2014 on the following departments: Otorhinolaryngology, Internal Medicine, Intensive Care Unit and Surgery. Altogether 652 marking was done and the cleaning outcome was adequate in the case of 350 occasions. The cleaning results were 41,6% (72/173) on the Otorhinolaryngology, 31,4% (89/283) on the Internal Medicine, 78,5% (51/65) on the Intensive Care Unit and 42,3% (138/326) on the Surgery. The results are reviewed and evaluated on every HTOs and departments. Conclusion Real-time, online cleanliness reports help to drive continuous improvement, because the nursing and cleaning stuff receives regular feedback of effectiveness of their cleaning and desinfection procedure. The goals are to reduce the risk of emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, and to reduce related antibiotic use.

%X BACKGROUND: Annual retinal screening of patients with diabetes is the standard clinical practice to prevent visual impairment and blindness from diabetic retinopathy. Telemedicine-based diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) in primary care settings can effectively detect sight-threatening retinopathy and significantly increase compliance with annual retinal exams. EyePACS is a license-free Web-based DRS system designed to simplify the process of image capture, transmission, and review. The system provides a flexible platform for collaboration among clinicians about diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Primary clinic personnel (i.e., nursing, technical, or administrative staff) are trained and certified by the EyePACS program to acquire retinal images from standard digital retinal cameras. Relevant clinical data and eight high-resolution images per patient (two external and six retinal images) are encrypted and transmitted to a secure Internet server, using a standard computer and Web browser. Images are then interpreted by certified EyePACS reviewers or local eye care providers who are certified through the EyePACS Retinopathy Grading System. Reports indicating retinopathy level and referral recommendations are transmitted back to primary care providers through the EyePACS Web site or through interfaces between EyePACS and Health Level 7-compliant electronic medical records or chronic disease registries. Results: The pilot phase of the EyePACS DRS program in California (2005-2006) recorded 3562 encounters. Since 2006, EyePACS has been expanded to over 120 primary care sites throughout California and elsewhere recording over 34,000 DRSs. The overall rate of referral is 8.21% for sight-threatening retinopathy and 7.83% for other conditions (e.g., cataract and glaucoma). CONCLUSION: The use of license-free Web-based software, standard interfaces, and flexible protocols has allowed primary care providers to adopt retinopathy screening with minimal effort and resources. 2009 Diabetes Technology Society.

%X BACKGROUND: September 25, 2014 a patient presented to a hospital in North Texas with flu like symptoms. He was treated and discharged home with instructions to return should symptoms exacerbate. He reported again to the same hospital on September 28, 2014 and placed in isolation to rule out Ebola. In preparation for additional Ebola cases, this 4 hospital system implemented a rapid, consistent and comprehensive method for identification and safe patient care. METHODS: Upon notification of patient zero in North Texas, Senior Leadership implemented a Virtual Command Center with twice daily conference calls inclusive of Infection Prevention (IP), Emergency Management (EM), Nursing, Materials Management (MM), Information Technology, Environmental Services, and Public Relations. Each campus reported their status and needs on the calls to foster consistent notification and response. This enabled the system to set the same platform at each campus that included: 1) screening and identification, 2) containment, 3) patient flow, 4) volunteers, 5) laboratory 6) supply management, engineering and 7) personal protective equipment (PPE) training. RESULTS: IP established screening and identification processes at each entry point, designated patient flow criteria and directed PPE management. EM and IP developed checklists and trained employees in PPE management. MM obtained and distributed supplies to each campus. The Laboratory developed an “Ebola Kit” that included all equipment needed for specimen collection and transported in a small cooler. Labor and Delivery (L&D) developed an “Ebola Cart” with all supplies and instruments needed for a delivery. The Emergency Department and L&D dedicated rooms for patient management; and staff volunteered and trained for the care of an Ebola patient. CONCLUSIONS: As a major healthcare system in the epicenter of Patient Zero's entry point into the United States, it was critical that each facility be prepared to independently manage and contain an Ebola patient; this system's approach provided a consistent and comprehensive response to Ebola preparedness. Rapid implementation of systematic readiness efforts allowed for diversion of resources to creation of an Ebola Treatment Facility.

%X Effective communication is a key factor to success in intensive care nursing. At Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) incorporated blogging as one of its primary means of communication. In the health care clinical environment, blogging can help to promote 2-way communication among nursing staff and leadership. Blogging can serve as a valuable method of relaying important updates, changes in practice, and educational resources. Incorporating a blog into the ICU environment involves a cultural shift and some potential barriers. Lack of a technological understanding of social media, outdated software systems, and limited hospital policies may pose issues when incorporating a blog into the health care setting. The benefits though are impressive. Blogging is a form of rapid, real-time communication for which any person may post or comment on an important thought or message. Blogging can help to increase compliance with quality measures, update staff on need to know information such as changes in policies and procedures, and provide up-to-date educational resources at any time, from anywhere.

%X The majority of trauma nursing education is focused on the emergency phases of care. We describe the development and evaluation of a trauma eLearning module for the ward environment. The module was developed using adult learning principles and implemented in 2 surgical wards. There were 3 phases of evaluation: (1) self-efficacy of nurses; (2) relevance and usability of the module and; (3) application of knowledge learnt. The majority indicated they had applied new knowledge, particularly when performing a physical assessment (85.7%), communicating (91.4%), and identifying risk of serious illness (90.4%). Self-efficacy relating to confidence in caring for patients, communication, and escalating clinical deterioration improved (p = .023). An eLearning trauma patient assessment module for ward nursing staff improves nursing knowledge and self-efficacy.

%X Background: One of the projects of the (CIHR) Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Research Team (SMRRT) is the development and implementation of clinical-research platforms to promote interactions between clinicians and researchers to optimize rehabilitation post stroke. To evaluate the impact of this platform a portrait of clinical practice pre and post project was required. Methods: On the last week of April 2012 (five days), the intensity of rehabilitation interventions provided to 18 in-patients with stroke was recorded from 8am to 9pm.The clinicians (OT, PT, kinesiologist, nursing staff and physical rehabilitation technician (PTT)) recorded the duration of their interventions (one to one or in groups) on discipline-specific log sheets. The time spent with a rehabilitation assistant and practice by the patients outside of official therapy time was also included. Results: The patients received an average of 13 hours of rehabilitation interventions per week (range: 9 to 22 hours). Eleven of the 13 average weekly hours were dedicated to supervised individual therapy (an average of 9 hour were given by OT, PT, PTT and the assistant and an average of 2 hours of rehabilitation activities were given by nursing staff). Lower FIM scores were correlated (r = -.75, p<.000) with more time with the nursing staff. Nine patients (50%) also participated in group therapy, thus adding an average of 1 hour per week. The 60% of patients who practiced outside of official therapy time also increased the intensity by an average of 1 hour per week. Conclusions: This project has allowed us to document the actual intensity of interventions received by the patients in our stroke unit and has helped us target gaps for improvement.

This article has the objective of reporting researchers' experience on the application of this technique in a study about nurses' competencies for the performance of Essential Public Health Functions. Experts were searched on the Lattes Platform of the National Council of Scientific and Technologic Development (CNPq) in Brazil. Two groups with 50 participants each, one with nurses and other with faculty with representation of every geographic region of the country were organized. The competencies validation instrument was sent by electronic means. Although it is reported that this form reduces the time for sending and receiving the questionnaires, difficulties to obtain contact with the experts, lack of return of the participants and a long time to answer the instrument were observed. Health care professionals need to understand the importance of their participation in researches with the utilization of this technique.

%X PURPOSE: Evidence-based practice is pivotal to effective patient care. However, its translation into practice remains limited. Given the central role of primary care in many healthcare systems, it is important to identify strategies that bolster clinician-capacity to promote evidence-based care. The purpose of this paper is to identify strategies to increase Practice Nurse capacity to promote evidence-based sexual healthcare within general practice. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A survey of 217 Practice Nurses in an Australian state and ten respondent-interviews regarding two resources to promote evidence-based sexual healthcare - namely, a clinical aide and online training. FINDINGS: The perceived impact of both resources was determined by views on relevance and design - particularly for the clinical aide. Resource-use was influenced by role and responsibilities within the workplace, accessibility, and support from patients and colleagues. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This is the first Australian study to reveal strategies to promote evidence-based sexual healthcare among Practice Nurses. The findings provide a platform for future research on knowledge translation processes, particularly among clinicians who might be disengaged from sexual healthcare. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Given the benefits of evidence-based practices, it is important that managers recognize their role, and the role of their services, in promoting these. Without explicit support for evidence-based care and recognition of the Practice Nurse role in such care, knowledge translation is likely to be limited. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Knowledge translation among Practice Nurses can be facilitated by: resources-deemed informative, relevant, and user-friendly, as well as support from patients, colleagues, and their workplace.

%X Purpose: We developed and implemented a series of interprofessional resuscitation rounds targeting fourth year nursing and medical students, and junior residents from a variety of specialty programs. Methods: Each two hour session was conducted in our patient simulation lab, and was held weekly during the academic year. Students were given specific instruction on the roles and responsibilities of resuscitation team members, and then teams of five worked through pre-defined Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) scenarios on a high fidelity patient simulator. At the end of each session students completed an anonymous evaluation of the program via a standardized questionnaire using Likert rating scales. Results: A total of 222 evaluations (101 nursing students, 42 medical students, and 79 junior residents) were submitted from October 2005 to April 2006. Mean scores reflected a strong consensus that these rounds were valuable for their training, provided a vehicle for understanding team roles in resuscitation, and that these rounds should be mandatory for all medical and nursing trainees. Participants also expressed a desire for additional interprofessional training. Conclusion: Despite challenges inherent in teaching a diverse group of learners, these interprofessional resuscitation rounds were rated highly by nursing and medical trainees as valuable learning experiences.

%X Since South Africa became a democratic country in 1994, the higher education sector has been faced with the challenge of transformation and restructuring. The Minister of Education in the Education White Paper 3 stated that "the higher education system must be transformed to redress the past inequities, to serve a new social order, to meet pressing national needs and to respond to realities and opportunities" (Department of Education, 1997:2). Higher education institutions were faced with the realities of impending mergers and collaborations across programmes and between universities and technikons. The Council on Higher Education (CHE) submitted a report to the Minister of Education in February 2002 which proposed the establishment of new institutional and organizational forms within regions (Department of Education, 2002: 7-8). The Minister announced changes in higher education based on his assessment of the proposals submitted by the CHE which resulted in the reduction of the number of higher education institutions from 36 to 21 (Department of Education, 2002:11-20). There were specific implications for nursing education in the Western Cape. In December 2002 the Minister of Education, Kader Asmal announced that with effect from 2005, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and a new institution, the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) would be the only enrolling institutions for undergraduate nursing education in the Western Cape. The Cape Higher Education Consortium (CHEC) instead proposed the establishment of a common teaching platform for nursing education in the region to meet the objectives of national and provincial government and to make optimal use of the combined strengths of the three universities and the technikon. This proposal was accepted by the minister and the common teaching platform, a unique form of collaboration, was established in 2005.

%X A fundamental purpose of mergers between higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2002 was to enable sharing of scarce resources between more advanced universities and those historically disadvantaged by the apartheid system of the South African Government. A common teaching platform for undergraduate nursing education in the Western Cape was established in 2005, in line with the transformation of the higher education system, as a collaborative initiative between three universities. In order to evaluate the common teaching platform, Stuffelbeam's context, input, process, product (CIPP) research model was employed. A sample of 108 participants was selected through stratified purposive sampling, and included three deputy vice-chancellors, three deans, three heads of department, 18 lecturers and 81 students. Semi-structured interviews were held with the staff members, whilst the students participated in focus group interviews. Open-ended questions informed by literature and the CIPP evaluation model were developed and used to guide the interviews. This enabled the researcher to obtain a rich description of the participants' experiences. The data were analysed inductively. The results revealed that the main purpose of collaboration was not achieved due to the lack of a common understanding of the concept of collaboration and its purpose; a lack of readiness to collaborate and a lack of sharing of resources. A framework for effective collaboration was developed based on the results.

%X 'SWEET' is an acronym standing for 'Better control in pediatric and adolescent diabeteS: Working to crEate CEnTers of Reference (CORs)' and is based on a partnership of established national and European diabetes organizations such as International Diabetes Federation, Federation of European Nurses in Diabetes, and Primary Care Diabetes Europe (PCDE, www.sweet-project.eu). A three-level classification of centers has been put forward. In addition to centers for local care, SWEET collaborating centers on their way to being a COR have been defined. Peer-audited CORs with a continuous electronic documentation of at least 150 pediatric patients with diabetes treated by a multidisciplinary team based on the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) Clinical Practice recommendations have been created in 12 European countries. In 2011, they cared for between 150 to more than 700 youth with diabetes with an average hemoglobin A1c between 7.6 and 9.2%. Although these clinics should not be regarded as representative for the whole country, the acknowledgment as COR includes a common objective of targets and guidelines as well as recognition of expertise in treatment and education at the center. In a first step, the SWEET Online platform allows 12 countries using 11 languages to connect to one unified diabetes database. Aggregate data are de-identified and exported for longitudinal health and economic data analysis. Through their network, the CORs wish to obtain political influence on a national and international level and to facilitate dissemination of new approaches and techniques. The SWEET project hopes to extend from the initial group of centers within countries, throughout Europe, and beyond with the help of the ISPAD network. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

%X The management of burn injuries is reported as painful, distressing and a cause of anxiety in children and their parents. Child's and parents' pain and anxiety, often contributes to extended time required for burns management procedures, in particular the process of changing dressings. The traditional method of pharmacologic analgesia is often insufficient to cover the burnt child's pain, and it can have deleterious side effects 12. Intervention with Virtual Reality (VR) games is based on distraction or interruption in the way current thoughts, including pain, are processed by the brain. Research on adults supports the hypothesis that virtual reality has a positive influence on burns pain modulation. This study investigates whether playing a virtual reality game, decreases procedural pain in children aged 5-18 years with acute burn injuries. The paper reports on the findings of a pilot study, a randomised trial, in which seven children acted as their own controls though a series of 11 trials. Outcomes were pain measured using the self-report Faces Scale and findings of interviews with parent/carer and nurses. The average pain scores (from the Faces Scale) for pharmacological analgesia only was, 4.1 (SD 2.9), while VR coupled with pharmacological analgesia, the average pain score was 1.3 (SD 1.8) The study provides strong evidence supporting VR based games in providing analgesia with minimal side effects and little impact on the physical hospital environment, as well as its reusability and versatility, suggesting another option in the management of children's acute pain.

%X Background. Bibliometrics are an essential aspect of measuring academic and organizational performance. Aim. This review seeks to describe methods for measuring bibliometrics, identify the strengths and limitations of methodologies, outline strategies for interpretation, summarise evaluation of nursing and midwifery performance, identify implications for metric of evaluation, and specify the implications for nursing and midwifery and implications of social networking for bibliometrics and measures of individual performance. Method. A review of electronic databases CINAHL, Medline, and Scopus was undertaken using search terms such as bibliometrics, nursing, and midwifery. The reference lists of retrieved articles and Internet sources and social media platforms were also examined. Results. A number of well-established, formal ways of assessment have been identified, including h- and c-indices. Changes in publication practices and the use of the Internet have challenged traditional metrics of influence. Moreover, measuring impact beyond citation metrics is an increasing focus, with social media representing newer ways of establishing performance and impact. Conclusions. Even though a number of measures exist, no single bibliometric measure is perfect. Therefore, multiple approaches to evaluation are recommended. However, bibliometric approaches should not be the only measures upon which academic and scholarly performance are evaluated. © 2014 Patricia M. Davidson et al.

%X Quality use of medicines (QUM) as a discrete concept is gaining increasing importance in Australia and is supported by a policy platform which has federal government and health professional support. The QUM movement is also supported by a strong consumer base and this lobby group has been responsible for endorsement as a major health initiative. However, the importance of QUM to achievement of optimal patient outcomes has not achieved sufficient recognition in the critical care literature. Implicit in the discussion of QUM is the rational, ethical, safe and effective use of drugs within a best practice framework. Successful implementation of QUM requires appropriate infrastructure and the commitment and cooperation of medical, nursing and pharmacy staff. Support, education and training provide the prerequisites of knowledge, skills and awareness for quality use of medicines for all groups. An emphasis upon evidence based practice and the prevalence of polypharmacy in contemporary health care systems requires examination of factors that are barriers to best practice. QUM in critical care areas requires appropriately skilled staff who are competent to manage patients with a wide range of selected drugs, often in highly stressful situations. In many situations in critical care, the role of the critical care nurse is one of patient advocate. It is important to note that the delivery of critical care is not limited to a discrete setting and is inclusive of management at the trauma scene, assessment and delivery of care in the emergency department, through to intensive, coronary care and high dependency units. This paper presents a discussion of the concept of QUM and its relevance in the critical care context. Key theoretical, policy and research considerations for establishment of QUM in critical care are reviewed and discussed. This paper seeks to describe key issues in QUM and endorse the need for a research agenda in critical care.

%X Background: Social media usage is rapidly changing and advancing methods of communication, both personally and professionally. To bridge the theory practice gap, nurses need to be involved in research, both conducting, reading and disseminating. Currently, no journal exists for endocrine nurses. Objective and Hypotheses: To explore endocrine nurses' experiences in conducting, reading and disseminating research, and whether social media would be an appropriate channel, or if a new endocrine nursing journal or platform could be developed. Method: An International Internet Survey was distributed to UK Nurse members of the British Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (BSPED) and the Society of Endocrinology. Flyers with a link to the survey were distributed at The Society of Endocrinology Nurse Update (Stratford upon Avon, UK, 2013) ,European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Nurses session (Milan, Italy, 2013), BSPED Nurses meeting (Brighton, UK, 2013), European Congress of Endocrinology Nurses Session (Wroclaw, Poland, 2014) and the joint International Congress of Endocrinology/American Endocrine Society (ICE/ENDO) Nurses Symposium (Chicago, 2014). Key representatives from endocrine nursing groups in Australia, the USA and Europe were also emailed. We actively encouraged respondents to distribute the survey link within their professional networks. Results: The majority of endocrine nurses use social networks on a professional basis, however a sizeable minority use them to keep up to date with current research and professional development. A considerable proportion of endocrine nurses expressed an interest in contributing to an endocrine nursing journal, with a strong preference being shown for nurse led research, case histories, guidelines, and literature reviews. Conclusion: In the light of the results, we conclude that endocrine nurses are well motivated to create and consume primary research in a networked environment, and that neither existing journals nor non-specialist social networks adequately meet their professional needs.

%X CONTEXT: In the Gambia, West Africa, Malaria is a major cause of death among children in rural areas. It has been estimated that in one division in the country malaria accounts for 40% of all deaths in children aged between one and 4 years. Most malaria cases are managed at home assisted by primary healthcare workers. The strategic plan of Gambia's National Malaria Control Programme includes improved training and supervision of all health care providers, at all levels, and increased community awareness in order to reduce the malaria burden by 50% before 2007. ISSUE: A malaria in-service training program for Community Health Nurses (CHNs) working at village level was piloted in 2004. The program includes a computer-based training (CBT) package, the first of its kind for health professionals in Gambia. The education program is part of a larger initiative funded by the Gates Malaria Partnership, that aims to increase community involvement in malaria control. The objective of the course is to enable CHNs to facilitate the change process. The curriculum was informed by a reference group and stakeholder input. Interviews and evaluation forms were used to gather information about learner experience and learning preferences. ANALYSIS: The CBT package was well received. Learners reported wanting more computer instruction, but felt they had gained confidence. There was resistance from other health professionals regarding the development of information technology skills in CHNs. This related to the perceived role and status of CHNs, as well as confidence in their ability. Some modifications of the CBT package were necessary, including the reworking of some activities and language. LESSONS LEARNED: There are issues related to sustainability and resource implications that need to be addressed. Opportunities exist to expand e-learning in the Gambia for pre-service CHNs and other professionals. An investigation into the viability of reproducing this module as a generic planning tool for allied health workers and other extension workers at community level will be undertaken.

%X Background Randomized studies examining the effect of training of mental health professionals in suicide prevention guidelines are scarce. We assessed whether professionals benefited from an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme aimed at the application of the Dutch multidisciplinary suicide prevention guideline. Methods 45 psychiatric departments from all over the Netherlands were clustered in pairs and randomized. In the experimental condition, all of the staff of psychiatric departments was trained by peers with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme. Guideline adherence of individual professionals was measured by means of the response to on-line video fragments. Multilevel analyses were used to establish whether variation between conditions was due to differences between individual professionals or departments. Results Multilevel analysis showed that the intervention resulted in an improvement of individual professionals. At the 3 month follow-up, professionals who received the intervention showed greater guideline adherence, improved self-perceived knowledge and improved confidence as providers of care than professionals who were only exposed to traditional guideline dissemination. Subgroup analyses showed that improved guideline adherence was found among nurses but not among psychiatrists and psychologists. No significant effect of the intervention on team performance was found. Limitations The ICT environment in departments was often technically inadequate when displaying the video clips clip of the survey. This may have caused considerable drop-out and possibly introduced selection bias, as professionals who were strongly affiliated to the theme of the study might have been more likely to finish the study. Conclusions Our results support the idea that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer programme is an effective strategy for implementing clinical guidelines and improving care for suicidal patients.

%X Background: In 2012, in The Netherlands a multidisciplinary practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior was issued. The release of guidelines often fails to change professional behavior due to multiple barriers. Structured implementation may improve adherence to guidelines. This article describes the design of a study measuring the effect of an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program aiming at the training of the full staff of departments in the application of the guideline. We hypothesize that both professionals and departments will benefit from the program.Method: In a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial, 43 psychiatric departments spread over 10 regional mental health institutions throughout The Netherlands will be clustered in pairs with respect to the most prevalent diagnostic category of patients and average duration of treatment. Pair members are randomly allocated to either the experimental or the control condition. In the experimental condition, the full staff of departments, that is, all registered nurses, psychologists, physicians and psychiatrists (n = 532, 21 departments) will be trained in the application of the guideline, in a one-day small interactive group Train-the-Trainer program. The program is supported by a 60-minute e-learning module with video vignettes of suicidal patients and additional instruction. In the control condition (22 departments, 404 professionals), the guideline shall be disseminated in the traditional way: through manuals, books, conferences, internet, reviews and so on. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed at the level of both health care professionals and departments.Discussion: We aim to demonstrate the effect of training of the full staff of departments with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program in the application of a new clinical guideline. Strengths of the study are the natural setting, the training of full staff, the random allocation to the conditions, the large scale of the study and the willingness of both staff and management to participate in the study.Trial registration: Dutch trial register: NTR3092. © 2013 de Beurs et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

%X Objectives: One of the challenges faced in nursing education is generating students' interest for working with frail elderly. Positive teacher communication may have a positive effect on students' attitude towards the care for older adults. However, based on low attendance numbers at training initiatives, nursing teachers seem to have little interest in geriatric care. With the digital tool Geraware, we want teachers to discover the challenges of this nursing field and hereby increase awareness of their own attitude with regard to geriatric care. Methods: The participant is guided through the life of an older women in her home environment, portrayed by herself, her children and the general practitioner. By means of questions throughout the story, he is invited to reflect on the provided care and alternative solutions and to take position. Comments can be shared with fellow users via built-in social media. The choice for a real person, the use of film fragments and learning by reflecting individually and from other users' reactions are evidence-based principles integrated in the tool. All four university colleges of the Associatie KULeuven, Belgium collaborate on the development of this project. Evaluation: In May 2015 fifty nursing teachers will test the tool and evaluate its user experience and usability by means of an online questionnaire. Based on this feedback, the tool will be adjusted and completed. A re-evaluation with all nursing teachers of the association KU Leuven is planned for early 2016. Conclusion: Our aim is to present in two years a final product of Geraware that meets the objectives.

%X Background: Many of these health providers lack sufficient experience with and knowledge of ALS. The ALS Centre Netherlands has therefore developed courses consisting of both e-courses and face-to-face training. Objectives: To enhance health care professionals' knowledge and skills concerning swallowing problems and screening for the need of psychosocial counselling for ALS patients. Program description: The e-courses are designed to elevate professional knowledge. Additional face-to-face training sessions aim to discuss problems as experienced, e.g. in the end of life phase. Four e-courses are available. The first is the free e-course “Introduction to ALS”, which is obligatory before following any face-to-face training provided by the ALS Center Netherlands. The other e-courses have a small registration fee and focus on, (i) swallowing problems, (ii) recognizing unrealistic illness perceptions, cognitive and behavioural symptoms and emotional deregulation, (iv) motivational interviewing techniques to let patients and informal care givers reflect on unrealistic illness perceptions. More e-courses are currently being developed. The total duration of an ecourse is on average one hour. The e-courses contain web lectures, text, assignments and multiple choice self-tests with feedback. Method: The e-course “Introduction to ALS” has been followed by 464 persons during the first six months that this e-course was online. Health care practitioners who have followed this e-course include nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians and social workers. The course was evaluated positively, with 98% of the responders (N=266) saying that they would recommend this e-course to their colleagues. The usability, content and usefulness were evaluated positively with average scores>4.0 on a 1-5 scale. Participants reported positive experiences with the flexibility of following an e-course anytime anywhere. Participants agreed with statements that they had reached the learning objectives, such as knowing the symptoms, diagnostic process, average ALS disease progression and treatment of symptoms (average scores>4.0 on a 1-5 scale). The ecourse “Swallowing” was followed by 39 practitioners in the first 4 months of being online and the e-course “Recognizing unrealistic illness perceptions” has been followed by 27 care providers so far. Clinical Outcomes: More evaluation results will be available from November 2016. Recommendations to the Field: Use blended learning, combining the flexibility of e-learning with the in-depth discussions of face-to-face training; involve educational experts to develop the best mix of learning activities.

%X Hypothesis / aims of study Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common health problem increasing in the elderly. Aging affects the urinary tract but additionally factors as changes in cognitive function, lifestyle and functional mobility can also contribute to UI (1). Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is considered to be the first-line treatment in SUI, due to curing rate, non-invasive character, low risks and costs (2). Impaired cognitive function is a complaint among many older people, the memory processing is limited, influences normal daily activitities, and is affecting treatment. WBVT is assumed to stimulate the muscle spindle and causes a tonic vibration reflex. There is some evidence that WBVT improves muscle performance and balance. WBVT is activating the pelvic floor muscles and induces higher muscle activity than during a MVC (3). Many inhabitants of nursing homes are incontinent, cognitively restricted and have physical declines. In relation to physical and cognitive declines, WBVT is a simple, not exhausting and cognitive realizable training with low risks in contrast to PFMT, what is beneficial but needs independent practice and implementation into daily life activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of WBVT, with or without PFMT, on urinary leakage in a female geriatric population, compared to a control group receiving a placebo treatment. Study design, materials and methods This study with 49 women (mean age 83.6 years), presenting a predominantly persistent stress urinary incontinence for the past three months or more. The women were recruited from a nursing home and followed-up in a 14 weeks program. The participants were divided into 3 groups: [1] received three times-a-week training on a vibration platform (WBVT, no cognitive resources required), [2] WBVT in combination with PFMT (consisting vibration training and once-a-week physiotherapy sessions combined with home exercises, cognitive resources needed), and [3] control group receiving a placebo WBVT(off-set standing on a vibration platform, no cognitive resources required). Group allocation was based on cognition level at entry. Outcomes measures for severity of incontinence was calculated by the 3 days 24 hour pad test and compared at baseline, 7 and 14 weeks. Quality of life was measured by the German language KHQ. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0, using t-tests for paired comparisons from baseline to 14 weeks with Bonferoni correction for multiple comparisons. Results 44 women with SUI completed the program, mean age was 83.6 years, 5 participants dropped out (three in the control-, one in the WBVT + PFMT-, and one in the WBVT group) due to other health problems. There was a significant decrease in urinary leakage in the intervention group who received PFMT and WBVT (p< 0.05).The intervention group who received only WBVT showed a reduction in urinary leakage, especially in the first 7 weeks, but the result was not significant. There were no changes in the placebo group. Quality of life was improved in all the groups but only significant results were found in both intervention groups within the questions general health perception and sleep/energy (p< 0.05). (Table presented) Interpretation of results There was a small effect size (0.2) found in the WBVT group. The reduction of UI in this group can probably be attributed by the activated and neuromuscular adapted PFM, improving intra- and inter muscular activity. The outcome measures of the 24 hour pad test showed, after 7 weeks of training, a notable reduction in UI but after 14 weeks the reduction was not substantially augmented, possibly due to the already saturated neuromuscular adaptation that took place in the first 7 weeks. The experimental group, who received WBVT and PFMT, explicitly trained multiple pelvic floor muscle functions such as muscle power, endurance, performance and reflex activity. This resulted in a significant reduction in urinary leakage. Concluding message WBVT is a simple and feasible training; however the results of o r tudy showed a small effect size (O.2), indicating that WBVT might be a useful treatment in impaired cognitive patients suffered by SUI. In patients who can realize PFM exercises the treatment combination of WBVT and PFMT is clearly more effective. Further studies should determine whether adaptations in frequency and/or intensity are able to enhance the training effects of isolated WBVT in cognitive impaired populations.

%X Introduction: A critical result is defined as one that is so abnormal that it represents a life threatening situation for which some immediate action is required (1). In addition, some tests may be identified as of such importance that their communication should be immediate, regardless of whether they are normal of abnormal (2). The ISO15189 standard (3) for laboratory accreditation requires laboratories to notify critical results immediately and to maintain records of the communication process. Deriving a set of reporting rules to ensure that critical results are communicated promptly without creating a workload that overwhelms the laboratory and results in information overload for the requesting clinician is a challenge. The ICSH has undertaken a comprehensive, international survey of laboratory practice in critical results management, which has been used with previously published literature to develop recommendations for critical results reporting. Methods: An electronic survey of twenty-one questions concerning critical results management was distributed by the ICSH Critical Results Management Protocol Working Group, with the help of various national and international professional networks and using a commercial, online survey platform. The objective of the survey was to determine laboratory practice in the management of critical results for the full (or complete) blood count (FBC or CBC) and peripheral blood film morphology. Responses were received from 666 laboratories in Europe (347, 52.1%), Australasia (119, 17.9%), East Asia (89, 13.4%), South East Asia (45, 6.8%), North America (25, 3.8%), Africa (23, 3.5%), the Middle East (13, 2.0%) and other regions (5, 0.8%). Of the responses submitted, 499 participants returned a complete set of data. 115 of these laboratories did not have a critical results management protocol (CRMP). The remaining 384 returns were analysed to determine the current pattern of laboratory practice in this field. Results: The laboratories returned their upper and lower critical results alert thresholds for haemoglobin, total leucocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts for adult patients. For all parameters, fewer respondents reported an upper than a lower alert threshold, especially in the case of neutrophils, where participants placed a greater emphasis on an upper alert threshold for the total leucocyte count. An upper and lower threshold for each parameter was determined from the mode of the participants' responses with the exception of an upper threshold for the neutrophil count, where it was not possible to determine a value from the questionnaire returns. Participants were allowed to identify multiple critical blood film morphology features in their responses. The morphological findings most commonly identified as critical were acute leukaemia (323, 84.1%), malaria (322, 83.9%) or other parasites (193, 50.3%), plasma cell leukaemia (238, 62.0%), schistocytes (177, 46.1%) and the presence of bacteria (137, 35.7%). The majority of participating laboratories used multiple sources to compile their critical results alert list (CRAL), with professional experience the most commonly cited method (277, 71.1% of laboratories). 246 (64.1%) developed their CRAL in consultation with referring clinicians. Just under half (49%) had used published literature; this relatively low figure may be due to the wide range of alert thresholds published (4). A variety of professionally qualified medical, scientific and nursing staff are utilised to notify critical results and relatively few laboratories utilise support staff, e.g. call centre personnel. Physicians are the preferred professionals to whom critical results are notified, both for hospital inpatients (367, 95.6%) and community outpatients (356, 92.7%) and the telephone is the most usual means of communication (377, 98.2%). Nurses are the next largest group considered appropriate to receive critical results. The notification procedure included a read-back policy in 77.6% (298) of laboratories and most (256, 85.9%) document this. Although the maj ri y of respondents had a policy on the action to be taken in the event that the responsible caregiver could not be contacted, these actions were variable. Similarly, there was little agreement on the time limits set for the delivery of a critical result. The likelihood of a laboratory having a CRMP was greater amongst the respondents holding accreditation than those without (86.8% against 63.7%). The frequency of review and audit of the CRMP was variable. Discussion: The results of this questionnaire provide a snapshot of laboratory practice in critical results management. A range of critical alert thresholds was returned, as reported in other regional and national documents. Using the results of this survey and a consensus of the published literature, recommendations on the critical alert limits for the blood count have been made as a basis for the development of local policy on critical results management. The prompt notification of a critical result is an essential part of good patient care (5). The laboratory should have a clear critical results management protocol (CRMP), which defines the critical results (a critical results alert list or CRAL) and the procedure for notification of results that exceed these thresholds. The CRMP should be reviewed at regular intervals and audited for its effectiveness. The CRMP must be realistic, consistent and credible for both laboratory staff and service users. For example, it must address the management of repeatedly and chronically abnormal results and the identification of dangerously rapid changes in test results. The terminology used should be standardised to facilitate understanding amongst users. Allowing certain requesting physicians to opt out of the critical results reporting process is to be discouraged, although it is acknowledged that different CRALs may be applicable to different patient groups and these may be facilitated by developments in information technology. The CRMP must address the timeliness of critical results reporting and include clear policy on what action is to be taken if the responsible caregiver is unavailable. Service users must be aware of these actions and their own responsibility to ensure that their contact details are clearly stated and up to date. Conclusions: A documented CRMP is a recognised requirement in accreditation standards and has the potential to improve patient care. These ICSH recommendations support a standardised approach to the development of a CRMP by laboratories.

%X Background: To describe a telemedicine program (TP) combining medical education (ME) and second opinion consultations (SOC) for public hospitals in Argentina (PHA) Methods: At distance ME is a useful teaching methodology for healthcare workers (HCW); SOC as a complement to ME would also contribute to HCW daily practice.We describe a TP for PHA, which provides ME in Infectious Diseases (ID) combining e-learning and on site tutorial meetings with a SOC system exclusively over the Internet. The TP is provided free of charge, since it is financed through unrestricted grants from philanthropic organizations. The TP was started in April 2002. The TP designates a local medical coordinator and an administrative assistant at each PHA and provides a computer and Internet connection. The initial phase lasts 2 yrs when ME and SOC are administered directly from TP headquarters (PHQ). After this period, TP is opened to replication by local coordinators, with permanent support and update of ME contents from PHQ. Results: Up to 10/31/09, 13,989 HCW (6,150 physicians; 5,846 nurses; 1,993 others) from 50 PHA have joined the TP. A total of 9,028 SOC have been processed in the period, with an average reply time of 36 hs. In the period 2007-09, 3,047 HCW (1,635 physicians and 1,412 nurses) joined the TP in the 25 PHA entering the second stage. As a result of permanent surveying and feedback, the TP strategy has been redesigned to include other resources: Epidemiological Research Division; Microbiology Branch; Immunizations Branch; intervention actions in HIC including WHO's 5 moments initiative. The TP has given quick response to emerging situations (A-H1N1 influenza and Dengue) and has incorporated external experts to comment on key SOC. Conclusion: The TP has successfully organized a network of HCW at PHA actively engaged in scientific knowledge exchange; SOC prove to be an effective tool as a complement to ME. The TP can be successfully replicated locally. Its main impact is its potential to unify diagnostic, therapeutic and prevention approaches in ID and its capacity to provide rapid response to emerging situations. Continued surveillance and feedback has opened the ground for new TP strategies besides ME and SOC.

%X Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have important socio-economic implications. Non of the available drugs is effective for all patients and many have severe side effects. To prevent complications IBD should be monitored carefully and treated in a multidisciplinary team. However many disease aspects are not followed systematically. In the Netherlands there is a shortage of gastroenterologist where the incidence of IBD is rising. Furthermore the government demands registration of efficacy endpoints for expensive drugs. For al these reasons healthcare reorganization is necessary. Direct involvement of health care workers, patient empowerment and integrated care improve the outcome of chronic diseases. Therefore we developed a telemedicine tool for all IBD patients in collaboration with the Dutch IBD patient's organization (CCUVN). “myIBDcoach” contains E-learning modules, monitors disease activity, disability, quality of life, compliance, infections, side effects, stress and malnutrition on fixed time points with validated questionnaires, allows the patient to communicate with health care workers and gives feedback to the back office and the patient. The aim of this feasibility study was to measure compliance with the system and satisfaction of health care workers and patients. Methods: Thirty consecutive IBD patients visiting the outpatient clinic in 3 hospitals (12 MUMC, 7 OrbisMC, 11 LUMC) were invited to participate. Patients received a username and password and used MyIBDCoach via internet from November 2012 until the end of February 2013. IBD-Nurses, gastroenterologist and patients received a 21 item questionaire before and after 3 months use. Results: Patients judged the system with a mean score of 7.8 out of 10 and 93% would advise others to use the system. All the patients completed the monthly questionnaires. Twelve out of 30 patients contacted their health care workers via the system during the test period. Eighty-three per cent of the patients found myIBDcoach to facilitate communication with the hospital. Ninety per cent of the patients completed at least 1 E-learning module. All the participants (patients, MD's, IBD-nurses) thought that the design and user friendliness of myIBDcoach was excellent. Only one patient thought the system was time consuming. Conclusions: Since healthcare reorganization for IBD is necessary in the Netherlands we developed myIBDcoach. This feasibility study showed a high satisfaction and compliance of IBD-patients and health care workers with this telemedicine tool. Therfore we started a large multicentre randomized trial investigating whether myIBDcoach decreases hospital visits and increases medication compliance and the quality of care for IBD patients without an increase in complications.

%X Objectives: Biomedical and health informatics (BHI) is a rapidly growing domain that relies on the active collaboration with diverse disciplines and professions. Educational initiatives in BHI need to prepare students with skills and competencies that will allow them to function within and even facilitate interdisciplinary teams (IDT]. This paper describes on interdisciplinary educational approach introduced into a BHI graduate curriculum that aims to prepare informatics researchers to lead IDT research. Methods: A case study of the "gerontechnology" research track is presented which highlights how the curriculum fosters collaboration with and understanding of the disciplines of Nursing, Engineering, Computer Science, and Health Administration. Gerontechnology is a new interdisciplinary field that focuses on the use of technology to support aging. Its aim is to explore innovative ways to use information technology and develop systems that support independency and increase quality of life for senior citizens. As a result of a large research group that explores "smart home" technologies and the use of information technology, we integrated this new domain into the curriculum providing a platform for computer scientists, engineers, nurses and physicians to explore challenges and opportunities with our informatics students and faculty. Results: The interdisciplinary educational model provides an opportunity for health informatics students to acquire the skills for communication and collaboration with other disciplines. Numerous graduate and post-graduate students have already participated in this initiative. The evaluation model of this approach is presented. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary educational models are required for health informatics graduate education. Such models need to be innovative and reflect the needs and trends in the domains of health care and information technology. © 2007 Schattauer GmbH.

%X Early childhood provides an important window for establishing behaviours that promote healthy rather than excess weight gain. One emerging and promising medium to deliver health related information and support for healthy parenting is via mobile phone apps and via websites due to the relatively low cost and high potential reach. This study reports the findings from the Growing healthy trial: an intervention delivered via smartphone app (or website) for parents living in socioeconomically dissdvantaged areas. This study aimed to promote breastfeeding, best practice bottle feeding (if parents were no longer breastfeeding), delaying introduction of solids until around 6 months and healthy weight gain. Parents were recruited to the study via their primary care provider and we also test the feasibility of this as an approach. The app content was developed by experts in obesity prevention and infant feeding with extensive input from nurses and parents. At baseline, 315 parents were recruited and completed the baseline survey. Retention to 6 months was over 75%. A non randomised comparison group was recruited via social media with similar numbers and retention. Final results will be available at ICO. Engagement was high with most parents using the app and reporting high levels of satisfaction with the content and mode of delivery.

%X Learning Objectives: The Society of Critical Care Medicine promotes a collaborative multidisciplinary practice, with a team consisting of professionals in different fields. Participation in social media activities, such as live-tweeting a meeting provides a unique opportunity for members of all professions to participate, and may allow for inclusion of a more diverse group in discussions. We assessed participation using social media metrics by physicians and non-physicians in conversations at the annual Critical Care Congress (CCC). Methods: Symplur Analytics were used to compare the characteristics of those who tweeted using the 2015 and 2016 CCC hashtag (#CCC44 and #CCC45, respectively). Characteristics of the top 50 participants during the conference were compared. Allied health professionals (AHP) were defined as non-physician healthcare providers. Results: There was an increase in tweets and participants from 2015 (4,374 tweets, 625 participants) to 2016 (14,358 tweets, 1,693 participants). In 2015, 27 of the top 50 tweeters were physicians, 7 were AHP (2 nurses, 2 advanced practitioners, and 1 pharmacist), 10 were organizations, and 6 were other non-healthcare individuals. In 2016, 22 of the top 50 tweeters were physicians, 17 were AHP (2 nurses, 5 advanced practitioners, 5 pharmacists, 2 dietitians, and 3 other providers), 8 were organizations, and 3 were other non-healthcare individuals. There were significantly more AHP participating in social media during 2016 CCC compared to 2015 (34% vs 14% of the top 50 accounts; p=0.047). The number of followers of AHP accounts were significantly fewer than the number of followers of the physician accounts (800 ± 626 followers vs 1,608 ± 2,282 followers; p=0.02), but there was no significant difference in number of tweets (7,403 ± 8,993 vs 16,764 ± 36,230 tweets; p=0.1) or duration of time on Twitter (4.8 ± 2.3 vs 5.1 ± 2.1 yrs; p=0.6). Conclusions: Social media is another way to engage all heath care professionals in academic conversations that occur during CCC. More effort should be made to increase inclusion in this important venue for multidisciplinary conversation.

%X Aim: To develop a formal web based, training module for all aspects of vascular access maintenance and surveillance, including teaching and accreditation Background: Local programs for pre-emptive screening and surveillance of fistulas exist to a variable extent in renal units in Australia. The practical skills and theoretical knowledge required to adequately initiate and maintain a surveillance program is gained “on the job”. A haemodialysis nurse is usually tasked with the responsibility of maintaining such a program often without any prior training or standardized formal instruction. A formal instructive medium such as a computer based teaching and assessment module will help initiate a standardized process of imparting specific theoretical knowledge and skills. Method: A cross platform HTML5 web based smartphone compatible software package was purchased. Interactive content including video footage, hot spot pictures and illustrations were used to create a web based module. In collaboration with an existing Nephrology Educator Network (NEN) teaching module and utilising some of the content, a new interactive program was developed. Results: Below are screenshots from the interactive module. Conclusion: This web based smartphone and tablet compatible educational module would prove to be useful to standardise practice and improve knowledge regarding vascular access and surveillance.

%X Background: Blood transfusion is an essential part of patient management. It is prescribed for the purpose of saving lives and improving patients' outcomes. Blood transfusion is often perceived as a simple mechanical task. It is however a complex, multi-step process, repetitive in nature, involving different professionals and crossing many clinical and management boundaries and there is no one group of staff that is fully in-charge of the entire clinical transfusion process. Nurses and midwives are in an excellent position to strengthen transfusion safety during patient care. As the largest group of health care professionals providing round-the-clock care, working from the grass root level and at the periphery to the tertiary level, they are directly involved in the clinical transfusion process. Aim: The main aims of the “Interregional Consultation on Role of Nurses and Midwives in Ensuring Safe Clinical Transfusion and Patient Safety” are to: highlight and identify the importance of role of nurses and midwives in ensuring safe clinical transfusion practice; provide a platform for countries to share experiences in clinical transfusion practices among nurses and midwives and develop evidence-based strategies to ensure patient safety during transfusion; introduce WHO Aide Memoire on “Blood Transfusion and Patient Safety” and Training Toolkit on “Safe Transfusion Practice”; identify key elements to be integrated into nurses and midwives education and training for safe clinical transfusion; identify countries' priorities for action, and make recommendations to international organizations for supporting countries to meet their needs in establishing and implementing systems for safe transfusion for patient care. Methods: WHO Blood Transfusion Safety Programme, as part of its collaborative activities with Sharjah Blood Transfusion and Research Centre, and working with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), International Council of Nurses (ICN) and International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) and WHO programmes on “Making Pregnancy Safer”, “Patient Safety” and “Nursing and Midwifery” is planning to convene a 3-day interregional consultation on the roles of nurses and midwives in ensuring safe transfusion for patient care, in April 2010 in UAE. Results: Sixty participants will be invited for the consultation from 20 priority countries based on their blood donation rates, percentage of voluntary blood donation and maternal mortality ratio. Invited participants from each country will include government representatives overseeing nurses' and midwives functions and education, and representatives from the nursing and midwifery associations at international and national level. The working methodology of the consultation will include presentations, group work and development of country plans. Conclusions: The consultation will be able to identify the critical role of nurses and midwives in contributing to safe transfusion for patient care, facilitate information sharing and communication of evidence-based strategies and innovative approaches to ensuring patient safety during clinical transfusion process, introduce and familiarize the participants with the WHO publications and materials to promote safe clinical transfusion practices and patient safety, identify countries' priorities for action, and strengthen the strategies and capacity of international organizations and institutions to respond to countries' needs on policy guidance and technical support in ensuring safe transfusion for patient care.

%X Objectives. To gather information on helicopter emergency medical services (HEMSs) activities across Europe. Methods. Cross-sectional data-collection on daily (15 November 2013) activities of a sample of European HEMSs. A web-based questionnaire with both open and closed questions was used, developed by experts of the European Prehospital Research Alliance (EUPHOREA). Results. We invited 143 bases from 11 countries; 85 (60%) reported base characteristics only and 73 (51%) sample-day data too. The variety of base characteristics was enormous; that is, the target population ranged from 94.000 to 4.500.000. Of 158 requested primary missions, 62 (0.82 per base) resulted in landing. Cardiac aetiology (36%) and trauma (36%) prevailed, mostly of life-threatening severity (43%, 0.64 per mission). Had HEMS been not dispatched, patients would have been attended by another physician in 67% of cases, by paramedics in 24%, and by nurses in 9%. On-board physicians estimated to have caused a major decrease of death risk in 47% of missions, possible decrease in 22%, minor benefit in 17%, no benefit in 11%, and damage in 3%. Earlier treatment and faster transport to hospital were the main reasons for benefit. The most frequent therapeutic procedure was drug administration (78% of missions); endotracheal intubation occurred in 25% of missions and was an option hardly offered by ground crews. Conclusions. The study proved feasible, establishing an embryonic network of European HEMS. The participation rate was low and limits the generalizability of the results. Fortunately, because of its cross-sectional characteristics and the handy availability of the web platform, the study is easily repeatable with an enhanced network.

%X Introduction: The Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines describe 24-hour in-house staffing by dedicated intensivist staff physicians as “ideal” practice. Although studies suggest that implementation of a 24-hr in-house intensivist model may be associated with improved outcomes in the ICU, it is currently unknown how many critical care training programs in the United States have adopted this model of practice. Methods: A cross-sectional national survey was developed, pretested, and then launched using an Internet-based survey platform. The survey was distributed to 374 critical care training programs in academic medical centers across the United States. Results: Respondents (N=520) were affiliated with the following programs: 256 (49%) PCCM, 110 (21%) PED/CCM, 43 (8%) AN/CCM, 29 (5%) IM/CCM, 71 (13%) SCCM, 11(2%) other (Combined Anesthesia, Emergency Medicine and Surgical Critical Care). Of the 520 respondents, 384 (74%) were fellows and 136 (26%) were program directors (PDs). 136 (36%) PDs out of a total 374 programs responded to the survey. Mandatory “in-house” call for critical care trainees was reported by 51% of respondents. Mandatory call was more common among Pediatric/CCM programs when compared to other programs (p<0.001). 24/7 coverage by a board certified or board- eligible intensivist physician was reported by 26% of respondents. The reported rate of intensivist coverage was similar between trainees and PDs. PDs reported that 24-hour coverage by an intensivist was less common among IM and PCCM programs compared to other programs (p<0.0001). Advanced nurse practitioners with critical care training (ANPs) were reported available by only 22% of respondents. The majority of respondents felt that 24/7 coverage would be associated with better patient care in the ICU, although 66% of respondents perceived this model would have a negative impact on trainees' autonomy and decision-making abilities. Conclusions: Twenty-four hour “in-house” intensivist coverage occurred only in a minority of the academic centers that participated in the survey. Survey respondents perceived 24-hour intensivist care as “positive” for patient care, but expressed concern regarding the impact this model could have on trainees' education and autonomy. Significant differences in practice appear to be present among critical care programs in the United States.

%X Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the current staffing models of practice and the frequency of 24/7 coverage in academic medical centers in the United States and to assess the perceptions of critical care trainees and program directors toward these models. Methods: A cross-sectional national survey was conducted using an Internet-based survey platform. The survey was distributed to fellows and program directors of 374 critical care training programs in US academic medical centers. Results: We received 518 responses: 138 from program directors (PDs) (37% of 374 programs) and 380 fellow responses. Coverage by a board-certified or board-eligible intensivist physician 24/7 was reported by 33% of PD respondents and was more common among pediatric and surgical critical care programs. Mandatory in-house call for critical care trainees was reported by 48% of the PDs. Mandatory call was also more common among pediatric-critical care programs compared with the rest (P < .001). Advanced nurse practitioners with critical care training were reported available by 27% of the PDs. The majority of respondents believed that 24/7 coverage would be associated with better patient care in the ICU and improved education for the fellows, although 65% of them believed this model would have a negative impact on trainees' autonomy. Conclusions: Intensivist coverage 24/7 was not commonly used in US academic centers responding to our survey. Significant differences in coverage models among critical care medicine specialties appear to exist. Program director and trainee respondents believed that 24/7 coverage was associated with better outcomes and education but also expressed concerns about the impact of this model on fellows' autonomy. © 2012 American College of Chest Physicians.

%X Introduction: Sleep disorders are significantly under-diagnosed and under-treated worldwide. Practitioners' lack of sleep medicine knowledge is a contributing factor to this public health problem. This global gap in sleep medicine knowledge directly affects practitioners' ability to recognize and treat sleep disorders. To address this problem, Current Topics in Sleep Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania was developed to offer free online asynchronous sleep medicine content available for CME/CNE credit. Methods: Traditional lectures were adapted to create 11 initial online modules and included topics such as overview of sleep disorders, sleep deprivation & physiology, OSA, & portable studies. Learners enroll via an online portal available at the Penn CME website, where they review CME course requirements, review the content, take a pre and post-test and activity evaluation, and finally claim credit. Results: From February 2014-November 2015, there were 4993 total enrollments by 1718 unique users across the 11 courses published during the period. 99% of enrollments found these educational activities at least somewhat relevant to practice needs. On a Likert scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely) enrollments reported an overall average of 4.2 for the activities' ability to enhance corresponding learning objectives. Demographic data of learners shows that participants are comprised of 15% physicians, 2% nurse practitioners, 2% nurses, 1% physician assistants, and 80% other healthcare professionals. Furthermore, 37 countries are represented with 93% of learners from the United States. Conclusion: Given the dearth of sleep medicine k nowledge worldwide and lack of formal learning opportunities, adaptation of current resources to web-based format can enhance access to educational resources. Next steps include reviewing data from a commitment to change instrument to assess how the learning was applied in practice and identify barriers to application. Future directions could include incorporation of principles of instructional design into sleep medicine e-learning materials.

%X Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a common treatment modality for acute respiratory failure (ARF) in critical care. Historically, a tight-fitting mask is used to provide respiratory support. This however is not without risks to the patient. The helmet CPAP is a new product that provides the same treatment with a different method of delivery. There is minimal evidence to date explaining the patient's experience of the new helmet modality. The aim of this research study is to explore critical care patient's experience of helmet CPAP. A qualitative approach was taken utilizing descriptive phenomenological methodology. In order to obtain rich data, six interviews with cues provided the platform for data generation and collection. A thematic framework was utilized with emergent themes manually analysed using a constant comparative technique to express the experiences or phenomena of a particular event or experiences. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The overall experience was unique to each patient. The patients entrusted the health care team which made the experience more tolerable. Paradoxical themes were experienced during treatment. The themes included entrapment, confusion, helping me breathe, liberation, challenges, apprehension, relief, trust and endurance. The desire to survive the acute illness proved to be a driving factor. The study has provided an insight into the patient's experience of helmet CPAP in the critical care setting. The findings have provided a basis for policy and guideline development. It will also assist in developing future patient focused care. © 2012 The Author.

%X Purpose: youtube is the world's largest online video viewing platform, but until recently its use for radiology education has been limited. In October 2012, using the collaborative resources of Radiopaedia.org, we launched the 'Radiology Channel' to help assess the utility of youtube for delivering radiology education. Methods and Materials: Channel statistics were gathered over the initial five months (14 October 2012 to 31 March 2013) using youtube analytics. Additionally, an online survey was conducted (29 March to 31 March 2013) using the Radiopaedia.org social media network to gather respondents. Results: Sixteen radiology video tutorials and three non-tutorial videos were released over the five-month period. There were a total of 26,715 video views and 55,902 minutes watched, with the 30-day view rate rising to 8,800 by March. Videos received 505 'likes' during the period and no 'dislikes', and the channel received net 1,371 subscribers. The online survey received 576 responses: 132 radiology registrars, 118 radiologists, 109 doctors (non-radiology), 88 medical students, 87 radiographers and 42 others which included multiple radiography students and nurses. 97% of respondents agreed that youtube was an appropriate platform for radiology tutorials and 98% agreed that youtube was useful for radiology learning and continuing education. 93% agreed that modern video resolution and streaming is adequate for online radiology tutorials. 80% agreed that online radiology tutorials could be more useful than traditional tutorials. There were no significant differences in responses between radiology doctors (radiologists and registrars) and other respondents for these questions. While radiology doctors were more likely to prefer videos greater than 20 minutes compared to other respondents (6.0% vs 1.9%, p < 0.001), overall the largest proportion of radiology doctors and other respondents preferred videos between 5 and 10 minutes in length (49% vs 57%, p = NS). Respondents most often nominated greater accessibility, lower cost and greater variety as the benefits of youtube tutorials over traditional tutorials, and these feelings were significantly more common in the group not containing radiologists and radiology registrars (p ≤ 0.01 for each). Conclusion: Early 'Radiology Channel' interaction statistics coupled with positive survey feedback results suggest that youtube could prove a useful platform for radiology tutorials in the future. Our survey offers insights into the preferred video tutorial length and highlights small differences in the desires and reactions of radiology doctors compared to those with less radiology experience.

The locus was a purpose built Clinical Simulation Laboratory (CSL) where the School's newly adopted philosophy of Problem Based Learning (PBL) was challenged through lecturers reverting to traditional teaching methods. The solution, a student-centred, problem-based approach to the acquisition of clinical skills was developed using learning objects embedded within web pages that substituted for lecturers providing instruction and demonstration. This allowed lecturers to retain their facilitator role, and encouraged students to explore, analyse and make decisions within the safety of a clinical simulation. Learning was enhanced through network communications and reflection on video performances of self and others. Evaluations were positive, students demonstrating increased satisfaction with PBL, improved performance in exams, and increased self-efficacy in the performance of nursing activities. These results indicate that an elearning approach can support PBL in delivering a student centred learning experience.

%X Obesity has become a world-wide problem, resulting in a myriad of health challenges for individuals. There are increasing numbers of people who are turning to weight loss surgical procedures such as adjustable gastric banding, gastric sleeves or gastric bypass in hopes of managing their obesity. There is little information about nursing care of patients who chose surgery. The objective of this study was to explore individual experiences following weight loss surgery. Of particular interest were individuals' experiences with maintaining hydration, dietary and eating behaviors and social interactions following their surgical procedure. Participants were recruited by an invitation posted on a weight loss surgery support group website and a social media website. Using a mixed method approach we collected data with an online survey and in person focus groups. Demographic data were quantified and themes were distilled using interpretive description from focus group conversations. Our results indicate that nursing care to maintain hydration was not seen as priority for nursing intervention however there is need to develop nursing protocols for preoperative preparation, post-operative care and follow-up. Specifically participants identified a need for pre-procedure preparation, information about healthy eating patterns, the importance of celebrating milestones, social support and long term maintenance of a healthy weight. Nurses have an obligation to gain understanding and develop strategies to support people undergoing weight loss surgery. These nursing initiatives will assist registered nurses (RNs) to develop protocols for peri-operative care and long term maintenance of weight loss.

%X Introduction: The Virtual Electrosurgical Skill Trainer (VEST) is being developed as a tool for training surgeons the safe operation of electrosurgery tools in both open and minimally invasive surgery. This training includes a dedicated team-training module that focuses on operating room (OR) fire prevention and response. The module was developed to allow trainees as well as practicing surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses to interact with a virtual OR environment that includes anesthesia apparatus, electrosurgical equipment, a virtual patient, and a fire extinguisher. Wearing a head mounted display, participants demonstrate knowledge of potential fire hazards by correctly identifying the 'fire triangle' elements and then successfully containing an OR fire caused by an oxygen (O2) enriched environment under the surgical drape. Within these virtual reality (VR) scenarios, trainees learn to react appropriately to a simulated fire emergency. An initial set of validation studies, targeted at establishing the face validity of the virtual OR fire simulator, was undertaken at the 2015 Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) conference. Methods and Procedure: Forty nine subjects (n = 49) with varying electrosurgical experience participated in this Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study. The subjects were asked to complete the OR fire training/prevention sequence in the VEST simulator. The subjects were then asked to answer a subjective preference questionnaire, focused on the usefulness and fidelity of the simulator. Results: On a 5-point scale, 12 out of 13 questions were rated at the mean value of 3 or greater (92 %). Five questions were rated above 4 (38 %), particularly those focusing on simulator effectiveness and its usefulness in OR fire safety training. 33 of the 49 participants (67 %) chose the virtual OR fire trainer over the traditional training methods, such as a textbook or an animal model. Conclusions: Training for OR fire emergencies in fully-immersive virtual reality environments may be the ideal training modality, and the VEST OR fire trainer was developed for this task. The results of this study indicate a high level of importance associated with the virtual reality electrosurgical trainer by the participating physicians. The face validity of the OR fire training module of the VEST simulator was successfully established on many aspects of the simulation.

%X Objective To assess changes between 2012 and 2014 in the quality of paediatric clinical and nursing care for UK children and young people affected with seizures and epilepsies. Methods Epilepsy12, a UK wide audit, commenced in 2009 with the aim of evaluating epilepsy care against NICE and SIGN guidelines. All NHS hospital and community paediatric services managing children with epilepsy were invited to participate. National key recommendations and local action plans were made after Round 1. Round 2 was undertaken between 2013 and 2014 to assess changes since Round 1 and results are reported here. Children referred for first EEG were used to find a new cohort of eligible children aged 1 month to 16 years receiving a first paediatric assessment between January and April 2013 for afebrile paroxysmal episodes. Retrospective case-note analysis was undertaken using a specifically designed web-based platform and audit pack. Service descriptor data were collected from secondary services on census day, 1 January 2014. Patient reported experience measure (PREM) questionnaires were collected from sequential children with epilepsy and their carers/parents attending clinics between February and March 2014. Results 192/196 paediatric services enrolled. 186 units provided service descriptor data, 174 clinical audit data and 145 PREM data. The clinical cohort consisted of 3449 patients; median age 5.2 years; male: female 55:45%. Anonymised PREM data were received from 2335 parents, carers, children and young people. 45% of first assessments occurred within an acute presentation. 35% of children had epilepsy diagnosed by 12 months. 22.6% of children had a documented neurodisability. 68% of paediatric services now have at least one Epilepsy Specialist Nurse (ESN). There has been a significant increase in percentage of children having ESN input; access to a paediatrician with expertise in epilepsies; appropriate assessment, classification and investigations in 2014 compared to 2012. PREM data showed 88% (1897/2148) overall satisfaction with services; 20% thought that staff are not good at working together. Conclusion There is evidence of significant improvements in the provision of medical and nursing epilepsy care. However, many children still do not receive recommended practice and access fully resourced paediatric epilepsy services.

%X Background: This qualitative study aims to assess the perceptions of nursing staff who care for patients with severe bleeding disorders and their families. Are we meeting their needs? Do we as nurses have more to offer in service development? Aim: Our aim is to determine how nurses perceive their role now, and identify, if possible, their perception of the future role of the ward nurse in the care of these patients. Methodology: A questionnaire was designed addressing components of “in hospital” nursing care for patients' with inherited bleeding disorders. The questionnaire addresses the following: identification of specific care needs for patients; evaluation of whether the service is perceived by nurses to be meeting those needs. If not, why not?; definition of the nurse's perception of his/her role in the multidisciplinary care of these patients; and do nurses have more to offer? Staff were given a 2-week timeframe in which to anonymously answer the questionnaire. Questions were limited to 5 to increase the likelihood of staff responding. Results: Findings have not yet been collated and therefore cannot be presented at this time. Results will be qualitative in nature and, therefore, may be open to interpretation and debate. Conclusion: The nursing process must be continually assessed and evolve to incorporate the skill base of staff, develop and build on past nursing experiences, in order to provide optimum care for our patients. Qualitative data has been effective in providing a platform from which to continue.

%X The West Midlands contains three major trauma centres; Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire and University Hospital North Staffordshire, along with Birmingham Children's Hospital who provide the paediatric trauma service. Methods In April 2013 practitioners with newly developed roles in Trauma in the Emergency Department made initial contact, and in October 2013 a formal collaborative was formed, with membership consisting of anaesthetic practitioners, both Nurses and Operating Department Practitioners that are working in the ED setting as an integral part of the trauma team. Results Our poster presentation will serve to introduce the work of the collaborative to the wider clinical community. Working alongside the ED staff and the attending duty anaesthetists the practitioners engage in the clinical care of acute admissions, including but not limited to trauma, medical, burns and paediatric alerts. The primary responsibility is providing skilled assistance for Rapid Sequence Inductions and airway management in conjunction with the duty anaesthetist whilst working in an isolated area. The associated risks of providing anaesthesia in isolated sites are well documented in the NAP4 audit 'Major Complications of Airway Management ' and the RCoA paper 'Anaestheic Services in Remote Sites'. As the role in ED has developed the practitioners have accomplished the requisite skills to fully integrate into the team and care for the full range of admissions into the Resus room i.e. MIs, COPD etc. The poster presentation will be an excellent platform to promote the collaborative and its work and inspire colleagues from similar institutions in the UK. Discussion The future aspiration for the collaborative is to establish shared educational and learning opportunities, a cross site skills exchange programme and facilitate a forum for sharing experiences and improving practice, with the potential to expand and include more centres across the wider region or country. The scope for creating an accredited qualification via a university based training programme is also being explored, to allow practitioners to be formally recognised for their extended skills. The opportunity to present at the AAGBI Annual Congress will allow the collaborative to clearly demonstrate the scope of the speciality and introduce the key roles that are undertaken and how they can improve patient care, as well as setting out future aspirations to the visiting clinical cohort.

%X Introduction: A nurse-led project team initiated by the United Kingdom Oncology Nursing Society developed a blended e-learning website to facilitate nurses to further develop their confidence and competencies in a range of skills related to assessing holistic needs, thus enabling and empowering members to lead change at a local level. Objectives: Development of a Holistic HNA and care planning elearning package for nurses, via a web portal. Methods: The project team identified three areas which were integral to an HNA implementation project. These were project support information, project management skills and practical competencies delivered in a blended e-learning package containing a series of accessible video presentations, supporting documents and practical activities. The team worked with internal and external partners to ensure that a robust and inspiring programme was created. Results: http://www.hnaforcancer.com/ was launched in October 2012 as a blended learning programme that incorporates e-learning on core subjects. These are videoed presentations with supporting learning material accessed via the Members section of the UKONS website. Participants are additionally offered free UKONS membership for 1 year. Conclusions By the end of the programme the majority of participants reported improved skills in identifying and exploring holistic needs and initiating care to prevent or minimise the risk of complications. Participants had also developed their confidence and competency in new skills, including basic project management.

%X Background: Safe and effective patient handovers remain a global organisational and training challenge. Limited evidence supports available handover training programmes. Customisable training is a promising approach to improve the quality and sustainability of handover training and outcomes. Objective: We present a Handover Toolbox designed in the context of the European HANDOVER Project. The Toolbox aims to support physicians, nurses, individuals in health professions training, medical educators and handover experts by providing customised handover training tools for different clinical needs and contexts. Methods: The Handover Toolbox uses the Technology Enhanced Learning Design Process (TEL-DP), which encompasses user requirements analysis; writing personas; group concept mapping; analysis of suitable software; plus, minus, interesting rating; and usability testing. TEL-DP is aligned with participatory design approaches and ensures development occurs in close collaboration with, and engagement of, key stakeholders. Results: Application of TEL-DP confirmed that the ideal formats of handover training differs for practicing professionals versus individuals in health profession education programmes. Training experts from different countries differed in their views on the optimal content and delivery of training. Analysis of suitable software identified ready-to-use systems that provide required functionalities and can be further customised to users' needs. Interest rating and usability testing resulted in improved usability, navigation and uptake of the Handover Toolbox. Conclusions: The design of the Handover Toolbox was based on a carefully led stakeholder participatory design using the TEL-DP approach. The Toolbox supports a customisable learning approach that allows trainers to design training that addresses the specific information needs of the various target groups. We offer recommendations regarding the application of the Handover Toolbox to medical educators.

%X Forensic nursing is a nursing specialty that provides services to a variety of patient populations who have experienced violence, including interpersonal violence, sudden or unexpected death, and motor vehicle collisions. However, many critical care nurses have received the background knowledge or practical skills required to provide the level of care required by many forensic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in knowledge or practical competence exist between participants using 2 different learning modalities: medium fidelity simulation versus face-to-face lecture. Participants who were enrolled in an elective online forensic nursing science course were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The 18 intervention group participants were given three 2-hour forensic simulation sessions in the laboratory. The 17 control group participants attended 3 face-to-face lectures covering forensic science topics. All study participants also received the same forensic course content via the online Blackboard platform. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in either knowledge or practical competency. The lack of results may have been heavily influenced by the small sample size, which resulted in insufficient power to detect possible differences.

%X AIM: This article explores the importance of embodiment in nursing. It examines different sources of authoritative knowledge concerning the body and embodiment. It argues that dominant scientific and medical epistemologies of the body have displaced and marginalized embodied epistemologies, creating only a partial understanding of the embodied experiences of our patients and our own embodiment as nurses. BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years, there has been a rapid expansion of theoretical literature concerning the body and embodiment, spanning a range of disciplines. The potential of these insights to the essentially 'body-based' practice of nursing is highly significant. However, although work in this area is now increasing, theoretical and empirical investigation of the body and embodiment in nursing has remained relatively neglected. DESIGN: Discussion paper. DATA SOURCES: Conventional approaches to systematic searching of the literature were not adopted for this conceptual paper. Seminal texts predominantly from nursing and sociology accompanied by more recent sources were used as a platform for theoretical reflection and to inform development of the conceptual arguments. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The paper proposes a corporeal (re)turn to nursing practice, one that recognizes the lived embodied experience of the patient and the embodied skill and knowledge of the nurse and examines the implications for contemporary person-centred nursing practice, research and education. CONCLUSION: At a significant juncture in nursing's history, when there is greater international focus on delivering higher standards of care, the paper calls for a repositioning of the place of embodiment in nursing.

%X Objective: To recognize the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in providing inter-D continuing professional education. To describe the learning needs of adult learners seeking professional development opportunities. To report on the development process of a University continuing professional education program including facilitators and barriers. To identify online technologies that can be successfully incorporated into CPE initiatives Data Sources: Contributing factors to the development of the graduate Certificate in Stroke Rehabilitation: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2012) reports that: • In the United States the fourth leading cause of death is attributed to stroke (Miniño, Murphy, et al., 2008) as well as the leading cause of long-term severe disability. • Almost 50% of older stroke survivors will experience moderate to severe disability (Kelly-Hayes M, Beiser A, et al., 2003). • Caring for survivors of stroke cost the United States an estimated $18.8 billion in 2008 with lost productivity and premature mortality an additional $15.5 billion (Roger, V.L., Go, A.S., et al., 2012). • In Canada, Stroke is the number one cause of acquired long-term disability in the adult population as well as being the most common neurological disease requiring admission to hospital. • The incidence of stroke in North America averages 150 cases per 100,000 population per year and will increase by 1%-2% per year for the next decade as the population ages. This makes it imperative that health professionals are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skill to meet projected demands for stroke treatment. Stroke rehabilitation helps to reduce the costs associated with stroke and improves the quality of life of stroke survivors. Health care providers in rehabilitation and other professions require education on best-practices and evidence-based guidelines in stroke rehabilitation in order to increase their effectiveness and efficiency in helping stroke survivors to regain function and re-integrate into their home and community lives. Contributing factors to the development of the graduate Certificate in Pain Management: • The Institute of Medicine (Consensus Report, 2011) reports that in the United States the annual cost of chronic pain is as high as $635 billion a year in medical treatment and lost productivity exceeding annual costs for cancer, heart disease and diabetes. • Chronic pain is the most common cause of long-term disability and pain is the most common reason people seek health care. In Alberta Canada alone, the number of individuals suffering with chronic pain is projected to increase dramaticallye by about 70%-over the coming decades due to increases in the population and the age factors (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2003). • In Canada, the Institute of Health Economics (Schopflocher, 2007) estimates that each individual suffering severe chronic pain adds an additional $3500 per year in direct health care. Combining prevalence estimates and population growth predictions, this translates to an annual burden of $400 million to the Canadian healthcare system, assuming an “absence of effective intervention for individuals with moderate or severe chronic pain.” The impacts on the individual and on the health care system described by these papers do not include the impact on the family, the workplace and the community that are experienced in the presence of chronic pain. These impacts and projections make it imperative that health professionals are educated in effective, evidence-based assessment and treatment of pain conditions. Unfortunately, this is a significant gap in healthcare professional training programs. A recent survey of Canadian health professional faculties (Watt-Watson, et al., 2008) revealed that only one-third of their sample could identify specific time dedicated to formal pain content in their curricula. Surprisingly, the study also found that veterinary students received roughly five times more hours on pain related content than medical students and three times as many hours than nursing students in their undergraduate training. Study Selection: Participants in faculty CPE program offerings are working professionals from the following disciplines; Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech Language Pathology and Audiology, Nursing, Medicine, Psychology, Social Work, Pharmacy and other related health professions. Both rural and urban clinicians nationally and internationally can participate in the programs as they are fully distance based. Graduate certificate courses utilize adult learning principles where participants are expected to come prepared to engage and contribute toward learning. Online content is focused on self-directed knowledge building strategies using a combination of online lectures, self-directed study assignments, case studies, and question-and-answer sessions. In addition, students are expected to utilize the online strategies such as: 1) discussion boards 2) chat forums and 3) inter-active webinars. Online webinars are open to all rehabiliation professionals. The distance based format allows clinicians from accross the country and beyond to participate. Webinars are scheduled for one hour and participants view the live presentation after which have the opportunity to interact with the presenter for a live Q&A session. Additionally, the events are recorded and posted to the faculty website for up to one year to allow clincians to review the presentation or register to view at any time. The current focus of the online graduate radiology course is physical therapists. Since inception in Winter 2011 well over 100 clincians have participated. Expansion to a three course certificate program open to all rehabiliation and other health professionals is in progress. Data Extraction: To date post-course evaluation has consisted of course registrant evaluations which are administered within 5 days of completion of each course. The survey contains 52 items of which the majority are 5 point likert type scales. Mean responses to each item and category are analyzed. Both qualitative and quantitative data are collected. Broad categories of evaluation focus on: • Course Objectives • Online Activities • Instructor Evaluation • Effectiveness • Grading Evaluation • Workload • Suggestions for Improvement Data on participant discipline and geographic location are also collected. The first cohort of 11 students recently completed and graduated from the Certificate in Pain Management program. One year post course evaluation of graduates as well as registrant employers to determine level of knowledge translation is planned for Fall 2013. Data Synthesis: Student evaluation data is used on an ongoing basis to improve the quality of program delivery. Curriculum review of certificate programs annually and engagement in consultation to continue to improve quality. Continued evaluation of the programs including follow up with program registrants to ensure that knowledge gained through the certificate program courses is translated into practice resulting in improved client care. Conclusions: The Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta is taking a forward thinking approach to continuing professional education through provision of a variety of online educational offerings to suit the various needs of working clinicians. Faculty CPE offerings take advantage of the latest in learning technologies such as online meeting rooms where registrants can meet in real time from any location with one another or with the instructor to recorded video guest lectures provided by national and international experts who are leaders in research, management and education from a variety of disciplines. Using the same technologies experts can be recruited to conduct live webinar events from their location of preference. Providing clincians with learning development opportunities that are based on adult learning and IPE principles, are available -when and where- they want in an easily accesible format, are focused on the evidence base in each respective area and provide gra ua e level credit are some of the factors that have contributed to program success to date.

%X Background: Cataract is the leading cause of world blindness. The only available treatment for cataract is surgery. Surgery requires highly-trained individuals with expensive operating facilities. Where these are not available, patients go untreated. A form of treatment that did not involve surgery would be a useful alternative for people with symptomatic cataract who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery. If an eye drop existed that could reverse or even prevent progression of cataract, then this would be a useful additional treatment option. Cataract tends to result from oxidative stress. The protein, L-carnosine, is known to have an antioxidant effect on the cataractous lens, so biochemically there is sound logic for exploring L-carnosine as an agent to reverse or even prevent progression of cataract. When applied as an eye drop, L-carnosine cannot penetrate the eye. However, when applied to the surface of the eye, N-acetylcarnosine (NAC) penetrates the cornea into the front chamber of the eye (near to where the cataract is), where it is metabolised into L-carnosine. Hence, it is possible that use of NAC eye drops may reverse or even prevent progression of cataract, thereby improving vision and quality of life. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of NAC drops to prevent or reverse the progression of cataract. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to June 2016), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to June 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 June 2016. We handsearched the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) and the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) meetings from 2005 until September 2015. Selection criteria: We planned to include randomized or quasi-randomised controlled trials where NAC was compared to control in people with age-related cataract. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We identified two potentially eligible studies from Russia and the United States. One study was split into two arms: the first arm ran for six months, with two-monthly follow-up; the second arm ran for two years with six-monthly follow-up. The other study ran for four months with a data collection point at the start and end of the study only. A total of 114 people were enrolled in these studies. The ages ranged from 55 to 80 years. We were unable to obtain sufficient information to reliably determine how both these studies were designed and conducted. We have contacted the author of these studies, but have not yet received a reply. Therefore, these studies are assigned as 'awaiting classification' in the review until sufficient information can be obtained from the authors. Authors' conclusions: There is currently no convincing evidence that NAC reverses cataract, nor prevents progression of cataract (defined as a change in cataract appearance either for the better or for the worse). Future studies should be randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials with standardised quality of life outcomes and validated outcome measures in terms of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and glare, and large enough to detect adverse effects.

%X BACKGROUND: Studying the effect on functioning of the emergency department of disasters with a potential impact on staff members themselves usually involves table top and simulated patient exercises. Computerized virtual reality simulations have the potential to configure a variety of scenarios to determine likely staff responses and how to address them without intensive utilization of resources. To decide whether such studies are justified, we determined whether a novel computer simulation has the potential to serve as a valid and reliable model of on essential function in a busy ED. METHODS: Ten experienced female ED triage nurses (mean age 51) mastered navigating a virtual reality model of triage of 4 patients in an ED with which they were familiar, after which they were presented in a testing session with triage of 6 patients whose cases were developed using the Emergency Severity Index to represent a range of severity and complexity. Attitudes toward the simulation, and perceived workload in the simulation and on the job, were assessed with questionnaires and the NASA task load index. Z-scores were calculated for data points reflecting subject actions, the time to perform them, patient prioritization according to severity, and the importance of the tasks. Data from questionnaires and scales were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t tests using SPSS v. 21. Microsoft Excel was used to compute a correlation matrix for all standardized variables and all simulation data. RESULTS: Nurses perceived their work on the simulation task to be equivalent to their workload on the job in all aspects except for physical exertion. Although they were able to work with written communications with the patients, verbal communication would have been preferable. Consistent with the workplace, variability in performance during triage reflected subject skill and experience and was correlated with comfort with the task. Time to perform triage corresponded to the time required in the ED and virtual patients were prioritized appropriately according to severity. CONCLUSIONS: This computerized simulation appears to be a reasonable accurate proxy for ED triage. If future studies of this kind of simulation with a broader range of subjects that includes verbal communication between virtual patients and subjects and interactions of multiple subjects, supports the initial impressions, the virtual ED could be used to study the impact of disaster scenarios on staff functioning.

%X DL is a twenty-three year old lady. She was referred to our nephrology services with oedema, dyspnoea, marked proteinuria and abnormal renal function. She was diagnosed with acute lupus nephritis. Her highest blood pressure recorded was a systolic of one hundred and seventy, and a diastolic of one hundred. This was very significantly elevated from her baseline. On day six of her admission she was noticed by nursing staff to have a laterally deviated gaze. She had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which prompted admission to the intensive care unit for stabilisation, airway and blood pressure management. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was highly suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. A marked thrombocytopenia and anaemia were worrisome for intravascular haemolysis. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia was confirmed on blood film and by reticulocyte count. Her acute kidney injury was severe and necessitated initiation of renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit. The presence of target organ damage marks a more severe accelerated hypertensive presentation with a potentially worse outcome. Prompt intensive care unit admission for monitoring, intravenous antihypertensive therapy and organ support is vital. We would like to use this case to discuss the aetiology, pathophysiology and management of hypertensive urgency cases. We will use this platform to then review best practice guidelines.

%X Background and aims: Neurological observations within the paediatric critical care environment are a key part of the ongoing assessment of a critically ill child. Anecdotal evidence within our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) suggested that these were not always completed fully. Aims: This audit aimed to establish compliance within PICU and the Paediatric High Dependency Unit (PHDU). The hospital policy and the 'Neuroscience Nursing Benchmarking Group' benchmark were used as standards. Methods: To establish compliance, 20 non-sequential day's observation charts were reviewed, all patient groups were included. Frequency and percentage completion of the modified Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was recorded. In addition, an online questionnaire was sent to all PICU and PHDU clinical staff. It focussed on self-assessment of knowledge, confidence, competence and training. Results: In total 4380 hours including 62 patients was recorded. (Table Presented) Verbal/grimace scoring and specifically identification that a grimace assessment has been done is identified as poor. The 104 questionnaire responses showed a high level of confidence but lower confidence in other people's ability. 69% of responses identified that they had received training (average 6.9 years). This may be due to awareness of what constitutes training. Conclusions: The development of an e-learning programme focussing on neurological assessments of intubated patients and children with chronic neurology is been explored. A review of scoring charts is been undertaken and re-audit will be completed after 12months.

%X In March 2010 ASCIA Anaphylaxis e training was launched nationally. This project was funded by educational grants from NSW Health, Western Australia (WA) Health and industry. It was developed over a 12 month period by ASCIA members. A need for anaphylaxis training prompted the development of an e training package. Face to face training was adapted from that package. Differences exist between states. State specific resources, legislation and experience in face to face training differ. New South Wales and Western Australia are the only states who currently use the ASCIA face to face training package. Western Australia rolled out 'Train the Trainer' workshops over 2.5 days to 25 anaphylaxis 'link nurses' who in turn rolled out training to a further 160 Community Health nurses across WA. This was funded by the WA department of Health. NSW had been delivering face to face education to teachers for 6 years prior to the launch of the ASCIA training. In NSW, there were an increased number of nurses added to those who already existed in this capacity. Crucial feedback on the face to face training was received from key nursing personnel throughout NSW as well as school staff. In WA feedback was received from school staff. In NSW several changes were made to both the content and the order of the face to face slides as a result of the feedback. The transition from e learning to face to face was challenging. Since its launch, as of July 2010, over 3000 individuals have registered to use the e learning nationally. A log of FAQ and feedback has been kept since the launch.

%X Background and objective: Analyse and promote the reporting of adverse drug events (ADE), to improve the quality and safety of care to be able to control the risks. Design: A software is available on the intranet website of the institution, to enable health professionals to report ADE. The drug and medical devices commission (COMEDIMS) of the hospital, centralizes these statements and always makes a multidisciplinary and overall analysis of the event, using a collection sheet which is based on the PDCA model (Plan, Do, Check, Act). It proposes the nursing and medical teams axes of improvement. Results: In 2015, only 48 ADE were reported and analysed by the COMEDIMS, including 20 from the paediatric centre (44%), particularly sensitized to this issue. Health professionals are divided as follows: healthcare executives (60%), nurses (23%), pharmacists (11%), residential students (2%), doctors (2%) and others (2%). The main impacted steps of the drug circuit are: administration (62%), prescription (27%) and the use or implementation of a sterile medical device (4%). Identified causes include related following factors: operational tasks and procedures (37%), health professionals (31%), work environment (13%), organization and management (7%), drugs or associated medical devices (5%). The number of ADE reports, taking into account the size of the institution, remains very low. In January 2016, the COMEDIMS decided to broadcast a communication campaign to promote ADE reporting, on the hospital website via the intranet. Three months after the release, this document was viewed 1059 times, and the number of reports increased by 229% compared to the same period in 2015. Conclusion: In front of the low number of returns of adverse drug events, and relying on the charter of non-punishment, the COMEDIMS wants to increase health professionals' awareness. In our hospital, where e-learning about drug-related iatrogenesis is already available, the communication campaign with poster and analysis of adverse events seems to be a useful complementary tool to enhance awareness of medication safety concerns.

%X Background/Purpose: Royal College of Physicians 2002 guidelines(1) recommend that people aged over 65 years on long term glucocorticoids are prescribed osteoporosis prophylaxis (bisphosphonates alone, or in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplementation) in order to reduce the risk of fragility fractures. In February 2011 we audited the extent to which these guidelines were met in a district general hospital. Methods: All hospital inpatients were screened over a period of one week. Their drug charts and clinical notes were reviewed, patients were interviewed and their general practitioner contacted as needed. Patients aged over 65 years taking glucocorticoids for longer than 3 months or more than 3 short courses in 12 months were identified and the presence or absence of osteoporosis prophylaxis noted. Results: 240 inpatients were screened. 27(19 female) met the criteria for the need for osteoporosis prophylaxis. Common indications for glucocorticoid use were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=8) and polymyalgia rheumatica (n=8). Results showed that 12 (44%) of 27 patients in whom osteoporosis prophylaxis was indicated were actually receiving prophylaxis. Conclusion: These results identify a failure of clinicians to prescribe prophylaxis and/or poor patient adherence. These results are infact worse than the results from a similar audit 2 years ago 44% now vs 68% then; we are using new appriaches to raise awareness about the need for steroid induced osteoporosis prevention. In addition to presenting the findings at the hospital clinical governance meeting we are using other strategies including training of new medical staff and nurses at induction, flagging the audit results, placement of osteoporosis guidelines on the hospital intranet and spot checks by inpatient pharmacy staff with use of fluorescent stickers on drug charts to identify patients eligible for prophylaxis. We also plan to use social media to raise awareness about the need for secondary prevention of osteoporosis by using Tweeter and Facebook. We will re-audit after after 6 months to assess whether these measures have been effective.

%X This article presents and analyses a training system aiming at acquiring skills in nursing cares. The aims followed are the development: --of an active pedagogic method: learning through problems (LTP); --of the interdisciplinary and intercultural approach, the same problems being solves by students from different disciplines and cultures; --of the use of the new technologies of information and communication (NTIC) so as to enable a maximal "distance" cooperation between the various partners of the project. The analysis of the system shows that the pedagogic aims followed by LTP are reached. The pluridisciplinary and pluricultural approach, to be optimal, requires great coordination between the partners, balance between the groups of students from different countries and disciplines, training and support from the tutors in the use of the distance teaching platform.

%X Objectives: Selecting patients for an autologous or allogeneic transplant procedure is often the result of an intensive discussion with treating physicians, nurses and other caregivers. Also moral or ethical questions can be part of this deliberation. In our Hematology department, we have started to organize a monthly moral case deliberation to reflect on a specific case and to improve the quality of care within that case. Methods: Creating a platform for exploration of views, investigation of diverse opinions and to gain a better understanding of underlying motives, a moral case deliberation has been started. This moral case deliberation consists of a meeting with health care professionals who systematically reflect on one of their moral questions within a concrete clinical case from our practice. Questions can be defined as “what should we consider as the morally right thing to do for this specific patient and how should we do it rightly”. The deliberation usually takes 60 to 90 minutes, and is facilitated by a trained facilitator. Several steps or phases are delineated in which the central moral question is investigated to structure the reasoning and deliberation process. Results: Reflection on good care and decision making results in a more fundamental and personal learning process focusing on the ingredients of meaning-making and moral judgements. It also improves the understanding of the underlying motivations for decision making within the different disciplines. Conclusion: A monthly moral case deliberation creates a critical and respectful multidisciplinary consultation to improve the treatment and selection of patients before stem cell transplantation.

%X Background: The availability of continuous access to care, while important to the chronic care model, is not easily achieved in most practice settings. Advances in technology offer the potential to optimize patient-clinician collaboration and communication, and enable “just in time” care. Mobile Health (mHealth) tools enable real-time symptom tracking and automated alerts when symptom patterns change to allow timely, efficient, continuous care. We are testing a web-based mHealth platform designed to facilitate between visit symptom tracking, real-time data visualization by patients and providers, and automated data surveillance. Methods: Pediatric patients and/or parents of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were offered access to an mHealth platform, called Orchestra, via a smart-phone based app that enabled personalized daily symptom tracking, journaling, and pre-visit planning including personalized summaries of their laboratory and clinical information prior to clinic visits. Tracked symptoms were monitored via automated data algorithms and statistical process control (SPC) rules, and values outside of either a pre-specified physiologic range or that showed a significant shift from a patient's baseline triggered an automated email alert to nurse and physician teams. The Orchestra platform and its integration into clinical workflow are being developed using PDSA (plan-do-study-act) quality improvement methodology. Results: To date, 22 IBD patients have been enrolled in the platform, with an average of 4.4 total symptoms tracked per patient (range 1 to 11) with tracker frequency ranging from daily to weekly. The most common symptoms being tracked are PROMIS Fatigue (n = 9), abdominal pain severity (n = 9), and custom measures tailored to patient (n = 9). Most enrolled patients (n = 10, 45%) are using the platform to receive the Pre-visit Plan and track a few (1-3) important symptoms. Patients have been enrolled on the platform for an average of 85 days (range 4 to 132). To date, 6 patients have triggered a symptom alert to the care team either by hitting a pre-specified threshold or a significant fluctuation in their data. Each of these alerts required earlier intervention/communication by the healthcare team than was outlined at the time of the last clinical encounter and resulted in change in medical care. None of the symptom changes that triggered the alerts were independently communicated by the family or patient to the medical team, but all were rated as medically relevant and actionable changes by the care team. Conclusions: The use of individualized patient symptom tracking in this pilot application has given us an introduction to the use of direct patient interaction in daily clinical care decisions. We anticipate that the use of individualized symptom tracking in testing of therapies will allow care teams and patients to share a common language when discussing response to treatments and may allow personalization of therapies and goals based on an individual's needs or values. We anticipate that the use of direct communication with the care team in a continuous fashion may also help establish the timing of visits (or type of visits) based on a patient's individual needs and physiology and lead to improved co-production of care.

%X The handheld computer, particularly the Palm(TM), was specifically designed for rapid input and retrieval of vital information. This article, based on research conducted for an on-line forum, looks at the emerging use of handheld computers in the health care arena. Concentrating on the Palm platform, it reviews current and future capabilities while acknowledging limitations. The article then summarizes the current use within commercial areas and draws the conclusion that there are similarities to be found in the information flow within health care. The recommendation is then made, based on current literature, that this is an appropriate and viable alternative to current data gathering practices and a way of bringing information to the point of care. Finally, the suggestion is made that nurses should involve themselves in the design, development and implementation of software solutions for this platform, thereby not only allowing them a say in how applications are developed, but also in how they work, thereby ensuring that they are of maximum value to the nursing discipline.

%X BACKGROUND: Within the Belgian National Cancer Plan in 2010 320 extra psychologists, nurses and social workers were recruited. This increased the need for exchange and sharing experiences in Belgium. In answer to these needs, the Cédric Héle institute (CHi) started to create a secure online community, with access to up-to-date information, training materials and scientific research. METHOD: After a phase of exploration of needs and gathering of information, a project was developed: the launch of an online community. This community was called CHiCOM. The Minister of Welfare and Public Health, Jo Vandeurzen, decided to finance the initiative. CHi started to development of a community in collaboration with IT. Chi set up contacts with universities, key-players and experts in Psycho-Oncology, to stimulate their cooperation in CHiCOM. Currently we are testing the community. A group of professionals in oncology tries out the community. RESULTS: CHi- COM will be an online community to stimulate the exchange of knowledge between health care providers, beyond the borders of the hospitals and organizations. CHiCOM will be an easy to use and secure platform, with close quality control. CHiCOM will have these functionalities: a knowledge library with a listing of research articles and project information in psycho-oncology and a powerful search engine, a clear who's who, a news feed, a forum, a calendar with useful events and training courses, e-learning possibilities, The last alterations are made. The definitive launch is scheduled at the next Chi event, 11 December 14. CONCLUSIONS: An online community is a relatively new phenomenon within the healthcare industry. A search for similar initiatives provided little to no sites. CHiCOM wants to create an extended network with large possibilities for knowledge sharing, for professionals and researchers in oncology. This will enlarge the chance for professionals in oncology to strengthen their knowledge and skills in the specificity of the domain of psycho-oncology, not only of professionals working in hospital-care but also in homecare. CHiCOM will become a bridge of collaboration seeking and information sharing between researchers and clinicians. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Chi will stimulate the use of CHiCOM as a tool for researchers, as a platform to perform research and as a platform to establish contact with possible research collaborators. CHiCOM will give researchers a clearer view on relevant research questions, introduced by clinicians. Furthermore CHiCOM will help to establish and realize multicentre studies. The Minister of Innovation, Ingrid Lieten, already approved a research project which will make use of CHiCOM. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Researchers can announce and publish their research results directly to professionals, which will facilitate implementation in the daily practice. In addition, CHiCOM can be an answer in the search of continuous professional development, in an era where there seems a lack of time and money invested in training or networking. High-quality information for oncology professionals will be bundled in one place, and CHiCOMwill provide space for interprofessional contact and exchanges.

%X Background: Stroke care involves a costly and time-sensitive interdisciplinary approach, which requires a supportive platform in order to explore novel patient care strategies. Our initiative aims to reduce costs and poor outcomes for stroke patients through increased coordination across the continuum of care. Methods: This innovative care model includes an inpatient component, Stroke Central. Stroke Central utilizes an intra-professional team of specialists, including vascular neurologists, advance practice nurses, and a registered nurse (RN) coordinator who serves as the central contact to handle all stroke-related concerns from staff and patients. The goal of Stroke Central is to provide comprehensive monitoring of patients throughout care, resulting in early detection and intervention in any complications. The role of the RN coordinator is vital as a facilitator for Stroke Central communication, care monitoring, and ongoing education and training among patients and healthcare professionals. The RN coordinator is charged with improving compliance with standard of care guidelines throughout the continuum of care and collaborating with other team members to monitor patients both remotely and directly. Results: After initiation of Stroke Central, results show improved patient outcomes for the 434 patients seen in the first two quarters of 2013 compared with the 822 patients seen in 2012. Lengths of stay indices have decreased in cases of hemorrhagic stroke (10%), ischemic stroke (19%) and transient ischemic attacks (31%). Complication and mortality rates in hospitals have also decreased; expected complication rate index for ischemic stroke decreased 10%, while the risk adjusted mortality index for ischemic stroke decreased 40%. Initial cost analyses indicate decreased costs for the inpatient component. Conclusion: Having a dedicated staff member, as a first and continual facilitator for contact has been essential in this innovative model. Incorporating this key role into primary stroke care can lead to an overall improvement in stroke outcomes in diverse hospital settings.

%X Until recently, supportive care for cancer patients in Japan was not well organized. Not too many oncologists paid attention to the improvement of daily life of patients with advanced or terminal cancer. Oncological staffs such as doctors, nurses, psychologists, and pharmacists at hospitals in Japan did not really cooperate efficiently. Recently, however, we have begun to develop and to expand activities for supportive care of cancer patients using new concepts of treatment. At the National Cancer Center in Japan an effort is being made to expand activities in PCU, the application of Chinese acupuncture for pain relief, and the development of a virtual reality technique. A system to connect cancer centers has been established and is now being expanded to facilitate a new database on up-to-date cancer information. We have already started holding multi-institutional medical teleconferences, telepathology and teleradiology on a weekly basis, covering nine cancer centers throughout Japan.

%X Review question/objective: The objective of this systematic review is to examine the perspectives, attitudes, views and experiences of pharmacy students, pharmacy academics and practicing pharmacists towards interprofessional education and collaborative practice through quantitative and qualitative evidence. Background Interprofessional education (IPE) has been defined by the Centre for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education (CAIPE) as “two or more professions learn with, from and about each other to improve collaboration and the quality of care”.1(para1) Globally, interprofessional education has gained momentum in the last twenty years. However, this has been more pronounced in developed countries such as Canada, United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. In an IPE environment, students are provided with a structured opportunity that enables them to interact with other healthcare professionals where they acquire the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes as part of their undergraduate learning experience.2 Once they graduate, they are able to translate this into practice. The practice environment is often complex and intense, and requires a high level of interpersonal skills for the health care professional to be able to work in an adaptable, flexible and collaborative environment and to appreciate the roles of the different health care professionals.2 Health professionals learning together and understanding each other better is the way forward and has been proven by international research evidence.3,4,5,6As healthcare systems advance, the demand for collaborative work between healthcare professionals from different backgrounds increases; therefore, healthcare professionals need to develop the knowledge and skills required to work together effectively in order to positively impact on patient care. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a ground-breaking document titled, “Framework for Action on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice” in 2010.6. In this framework, WHO strongly advocated the development and integration of IPE into healthcare curricula. They emphasized the importance of adapting team based collaborative models in all the different areas of healthcare to enhance the delivery of healthcare services. Collaborative practice occurs “when multiple health workers from different professional backgrounds work together with patients, families, carers, and communities to deliver the highest quality of care”.6(p13) Therefore, collaboration involves solving challenging problems together, interacting, negotiating and jointly working with health workers from any background. This is where two or more healthcare professionals work cohesively to address patient needs. Benefits of collaborative practice include strengthening health care systems and improving patient care in terms of quality and safety provided, reducing the cost of care, shortening patients’ duration of hospital stay, and improving health outcomes.6,7In terms of pharmacy and the expanding and evolving role of the pharmacist seen in the early nineties with the emergence of the concept of pharmaceutical care concept by Hepler and Strand, 8 it is important that this role is recognized and understood by other healthcare providers and healthcare students so that there is effective collaboration and team work. With this in mind, pharmacists also need to recognize and understand other professionals’ roles. Pharmacists need to be able to assume new innovative roles centered on patient care rather than being product centered. These roles include medication reviews, chronic disease management, immunization services, well-being programs, prescribing and becoming an integral part healthcare decision making team based on evidence based practice. A number of systematic reviews on IPE exist with the first one dating back to 1999. These found no rigorous quantitative evidence on the effects of IPE.9 Table 1 summarizes the main systematic reviews to date focusing on IPE. In the above best evidence yst matic review of IPE published in 2007, most of the studies evaluated IPE that was delivered to healthcare students during their undergraduate studies. The majority of participants were from medicine, nursing and physiotherapy, with pharmacy students being less prevalent.3 This finding was echoed in another review which found that medical students were included in all the studies with high representation by nursing students, and less by students from other health care fields, including pharmacy.4 The pharmacy profession was represented in the primary literature reviewed but its perspective and inclusion was not explicit. Hence there is a need to conduct a systematic review to investigate literature that specifically explores the pharmacy perspective on IPE. It would be useful to investigate the interprofessional learning within pharmacy courses, as providing this information can potentially lead to the development of new and innovative teaching strategies which will potentially benefit health professionals. It is interesting to note that after searching the Cochrane Collaboration’s database, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports and general literature, the authors believe that no systematic review with a uni-professional healthcare perspective has been undertaken previously; therefore, this review will be unique in that it will be the first to investigate a single healthcare profession’s perspective about IPE and collaborative practice. This is the first systematic review investigating pharmacy perspectives of IPE worldwide. It is anticipated that this review will consolidate and synthesize existing findings regarding pharmacy perspectives on IPE and provide a better understanding of what shapes this perspective. It will also provide us with the platform needed to develop and implement IPE activities that are meaningful, comprehensive and unique. The outcomes of this research will provide a set of recommendations to be used by pharmacy and other healthcare educators to plan and implement innovative IPE activities that are relevant and meaningful to students.

%X Aims and objectives. A study was undertaken of the current knowledge and future training requirements of nurses in information and computer technology to inform policy to meet national goals for health. Background. The role of the modern clinical nurse is intertwined with information and computer technology and adoption of such technology forms an important component of national strategies in health. The majority of nurses are expected to use information and computer technology during their work; however, the full extent of their knowledge and experience is unclear. Design. Self-administered postal survey. Methods. A 78-item questionnaire was distributed to 10,000 Australian Nursing Federation members to identify the nurses' use of information and computer technology. Eighteen items related to nurses' training and education in information and computer technology. Results. Response rate was 44%. Computers were used by 86·3% of respondents as part of their work-related activities. Between 4-17% of nurses had received training in each of 11 generic computer skills and software applications during their preregistration/pre- enrolment and between 12-30% as continuing professional education. Nurses who had received training believed that it was adequate to meet the needs of their job and was given at an appropriate time. Almost half of the respondents indicated that they required more training to better meet the information and computer technology requirements of their jobs and a quarter believed that their level of computer literacy was restricting their career development. Nurses considered that the vast majority of employers did not encourage information and computer technology training and, for those for whom training was available, workload was the major barrier to uptake. Nurses favoured introduction of a national competency standard in information and computer technology. Conclusions. For the considerable benefits of information and computer technology to be incorporated fully into the health system, employers must pay more attention to the training and education of nurses who are the largest users of that technology. Relevance to clinical practice. Knowledge of the training and education needs of clinical nurses with respect to information and computer technology will provide a platform for the development of appropriate policies by government and by employers. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Memorial University of Newfoundland has been continuously involved in telemedicine activities since 1975. Unlike most early telemedicine programs, which did not continue after grant funding ended, Memorial made the transition to create a self-sufficient Telemedicine Centre. Key to its success was the vision and drive of its founder, Dr. Max House, and adherence to the following principles: (1) all activities were based on a legitimate need; (2) the simplest, least expensive technology was used to meet the need; (3) the network was shared by a variety of users; and (4) users were given proper training and support. Over the years, Memorial has been involved in 30 telemedicine projects, many of which became ongoing services. Although most initial activity was health related, educational activities have played an increasingly important role. In 1997, the Telemedicine Centre delivered approximately 7000 hours of programming and administered a network of 247 dedicated audioconference sites in 161 communities (168 of the sites had telewriter workstations and 75 had multimedia workstations) and eight videoconferencing sites. Approximately 70% of all programming was distant high school and university education, 20% health education, 5% clinical activities, and 5% other uses. Current clinical activities include tele- electroencephalograms, tele-ultrasonography, tele-nuclear medicine, child telepsychiatry, general teleconsultation from a remote nursing station, and general teleconsultation from an offshore oil platform. Lessons learned from more than 20 years of telemedicine experience are presented.

%X This evaluation research focused on methods for improving simulation instruction by determining if students ' knowledge about simulation subject matter improved and was retained following a simulation experience. Using a pretest/posttest approach, NCLEX-style questions pertaining to the simulation subject matter content were administered to nursing students from two prelicensure nursing courses immediately preceding the simulation, immediately following the simulation, and then again at their final examinations. These findings have helped faculty determine when their simulation instruction is effective and have provided a guide for revising their simulation teaching. While this pretest/posttest method offers insight into student learning outcomes, it perhaps more importantly creates a systematic approach for evaluating simulation instruction.

%X Introduction NICE IBD quality standard (QS81) and the IBD Standards aim to deliver high quality and safe clinical care to IBD patients throughout the UK that is patient-centred and evidence based. These aims are supported by the national biologic therapy audit. To improve and standardise the care of our IBD patients on biologic therapy we began a weekly multi-disciplinary (physicians, IBD nurses, and pharmacist) virtual biologics clinic (VBC). Here, the response to therapy is monitored (clinical scoring, well-being, laboratory results), the scheduling of investigations are coordinated, and the review and writing of prescriptions undertaken. Methods We prospectively collected data from our VBC for 8 consecutive weeks. Changes to therapy on clinical grounds were noted, and the financial implications of these changes calculated. Calculations for IFX savings were based on an average dose of 300 mg per patient plus infusion costs. The ordering of required investigations and the occurrence of adverse clinical events were recorded. Results In 8 weeks, 360 patient reviews were performed relating to 327 patients (IFX = 207, ADA = 79, VEDO = 41). Therapy was adjusted in 41/327 patients (12.5%). 5 stopped biologic therapy, 19 switched drug, 10 reduced and 7 increased therapy frequency. Net saving in prescribing was £10,928 at 8 weeks (>£65 K/annum). The coordinated prescribing of medication and pharmacy sign off improved the delivery of therapy and patient satisfaction. 23 colonoscopies, 9 MR scans, and 45 outpatient appointments to assess response to therapy at 3 or 12 months, were scheduled from the VBC. 5 complications were highlighted (recurrent infection; 2 required surgery; cancer; severe IBD flare requiring hospitalisation). In total 118/357 (36%) patients had their care altered by VBC intervention (41 adjusted therapies, 77 scheduled monitoring and further clinical input. Conclusion The VBC provides a safe platform to initiate and monitor biologic therapies and to audit practices. The introduction of a multi-disciplinary VBC has altered the management of 118/327 patients (36%) based on clinical findings, results, and NICE guidance. Significant financial savings (£65 K per annum), the streamlining of prescribing, and superior patient monitoring have helped to improve the quality and safety of care provided. The transition to biosimilar anti- TNF therapies can also be facilitated using a VBC forum.

%X Background and Purpose: Evidence-based medical education is not as causal and universal as evidence-based medicine; the advantages of new educational methods and interventions must be translated into particular contexts of use before they can be truly assimilated. Virtual patients constitute a well established and increasingly well researched design for learning and assessment but their uptake has been very uneven. Methodology: The 'Pathways for Interactive Narrative Education' (PINE) Project was established to ground the development and use of virtual patient designs in the institutions providing healthcare education in Northern Ontario. Funded by Inukshuk Wireless and an Interprofessional Education initiative at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine the 12-month project engaged 75 authors from across the province in 10 workshops and 30 small group sessions. The result is a bank of 60 freely available virtual patient cases covering topics in medicine, nursing, midwifery and interprofessional practice, each with a distinct Canadian flavour. Results: Although PINE can be considered successful in terms of the content generated, the real success is the development and transformation of healthcare education practice in the participant institutions involved. Three notable changes arising from PINE are enabling the redesign of the third year of a multisite Ontario-wide midwifery program, the redevelopment of the NOSM IPE program and the augmentation of the NOSM undergraduate medical program to make use of virtual patients in a variety of contexts. Conclusion and Discussion: PINE was able to effect change by providing a focus and a resource for faculty development and experiment outside existing programs and curricula.

%X Due to the growing importance of cities as a consequence of increasing urbanisation and of providing suitable infrastructure as well as the administrative competence for useful health promotion measures, in 1987 the World Health Organisation (WHO) founded the project 'Healthy Cities'. Vienna has been member of this network since 1988 and is one of the biggest cities thereof. Within the scope of the WHO-project 'Vienna - Healthy City' some nutrition-relevant activities such as the First Nutrition Report for Vienna (1994) or the reports about Nutrition of the Elderly in Vienna (1996) and Nutrition and Prevention in Vienna (1996) were commissioned. Since 1997 a City Health Plan for Vienna has been under construction, which priorities an activity-concept on nutrition, designed and performed by the Institute of Nutritional Sciences. The primary objective of the nutrition part of the City Health Plan is the connection of all institutions in Vienna which deal with nutrition information or consulting through establishing a 'nutrition- information-network'. The latter shall provide a contact platform and coordination centre for the participating institutions, which aligns the existing inconsistent supply of information and equips it with synergistic topics and goals. This strategy shall indirectly reduce uncertainties in nutrition-related issues and optimise the nutritional situation of all Viennese population groups. Placing a seal of approval on information materials, target-group-adjusted training of multipliers (teachers, nurses etc.) and intensive public relations are some of the network's most important implementation measures scheduled.

%X Background: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is highly effective in tissue diagnosis but may require prolonged procedure time. A multi-needle exchange platform (Beacon bnx®) allows for the passage of multiple sequential needles through a single delivery system without having to remove the system from the endoscope, thereby permitting additional needle passes to be made during concomitant specimen processing. We hypothesized that EUS-FNA with a multi-needle platform (MULTI) results in quicker FNA times compared with a traditional single-needle platform (SINGLE). Therefore, we aimed to compare the mean total FNA time and mean time per needle pass between these two platforms. Methods: A prospective observational study at a single tertiary care center was conducted from 9-11/2012. All consecutive patients referred for EUS-FNA of any lesion that required multiple (>1) needle passes were included in analysis. Data collected included patient demographics, procedure indication, type of needle used (SINGLE vs MULTI), needle gauge, total FNA time (minutes from insertion of first needle to withdrawal of last pass), total number of needle passes, and final pathology. Four endoscopists performed all procedures. Needle platform selection and number of needle passes was at the discretion of the endoscopist. Univariate statistics were performed, including Student's t test. Results: A total of 22 EUS-FNAs were performed. The mean age of patients was 66 ± 14 years; 12 (54.5%) patients were female. Pancreatic mass was the most common indication (15, 68%) (Table 1). MULTI was used in 17 cases, SINGLE in 5. The mean total FNA time was significantly lower with MULTI vs SINGLE (15.9 ± 6.6 mins vs 27.6 ± 7.6 mins respectively, p=0.003). The mean time per needle pass was significantly lower with MULTI (3.5 ± 1.1 mins vs 6.1 ± 0.38 mins, p <0.0001) (Figure 1). There was no significant difference in the mean number of passes performed between the two modalities (MULTI 4.8 vs 4.6, p=NS). The majority of needles utilized were 22 gauge (88% (37)). On site cytology evaluation was present for 19 (86%) of 22 cases, all at the onset of the first needle puncture. In 94% of multi-needle platform cases, FNA was able to provide a sample with adequate cellularity for diagnosis. The final diagnosis was malignancy in 15 of all cases (68%). Both nursing and technician support were required for rapid exchange using the multi-needle system. Conclusions: A multi-needle exchange platform decreases the FNA time by nearly 50% compared with the traditional single-needle platform. Increased efficiency of FNA may lead to shortened procedure time, reduced anesthesia exposure for the patient and enhanced endoscopic unit efficiency. These preliminary results have provided the impetus for a multicenter randomized trial, whose design is currently underway. (Figure Presented).

%X Background: Virtual reality simulators allow trainees to practice techniques without consequences, reduce potential risk associated with training, minimize animal use, and help to develop standards and optimize procedures. Current intravenous (IV) catheter placement training methods utilize plastic arms, however, the lack of variability can diminish the educational stimulus for the student. This study compares the effectiveness of an interactive, multimedia, virtual reality computer IV catheter simulator with a traditional laboratory experience of teaching IV venipuncture skills to both nursing and medical students. Methods: A randomized, pretest-posttest experimental design was employed. A total of 163 participants, 70 baccalaureate nursing students and 93 third-year medical students beginning their fundamental skills training were recruited. The students ranged in age from 20 to 55 years (mean 25). Fifty-eight percent were female and 68% percent perceived themselves as having average computer skills (25% declaring excellence). The methods of IV catheter education compared included a traditional method of instruction involving a scripted self-study module which involved a 10-minute videotape, instructor demonstration, and hands-on-experience using plastic mannequin arms. The second method involved an interactive multimedia, commercially made computer catheter simulator program utilizing virtual reality (CathSim). Results: The pretest scores were similar between the computer and the traditional laboratory group. There was a significant improvement in cognitive gains, student satisfaction, and documentation of the procedure with the traditional laboratory group compared with the computer catheter simulator group. Both groups were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly. Conclusions: This evaluation and assessment was an initial effort to assess new teaching methodologies related to intravenous catheter placement and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors. Technology alone is not a solution for stand alone IV catheter placement education. A traditional learning method was preferred by students. The combination of these two methods of education may further enhance the trainee's satisfaction and skill acquisition level. © 2003 Excerpta Medica, Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Background: The clinical use of genetic testing in ACS is limited by accessibility and turn-around-time. Nanosphere Verigene® System is a novel point-of-care (POC) genetic test analyzing 11 CYP2C19 variants within 3 hours. We evaluated the accuracy of the method to identify extensive (EM) and reduced clopidogrel (clop) metabolizers (RM) in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients by comparing the results to an established, validated laboratory-based genotyping method. Methods: 74 stable CAD patients on clop 75 mg daily were tested by clinical nurses with no genetic laboratory experience and 1 hour of basic training on the device. The patients were defined as EM (∗1/∗1∗1/∗17∗17/∗17), RM (∗1/∗2A∗1/∗8∗2A/∗2A∗2A/∗3). Genetic testing was conducted on 1 mL of whole blood using the Verigene® System and compared to an Affymetrix® DMET+ assay. Pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure to clop's active metabolite (AM) was measured and platelet reactivity (PD) was assessed with the VerifyNow™ P2Y12 system (PRU) and VASP (PRI) assays. Results: There was an overall 99.9% concordance of marker-level data between the Verigene® and the reference (DMET+) in measuring the CYP2C19 markers of interest. There was a 100% agreement between Verigene® and the reference test in classifying the patients into established EM and RM groups. The POC assay identified 59 EM, 15 RM. The EM group had significantly lower PRU (LS means 158 vs. 212; p=0.003), and PRI (LS means 48 vs. 63, p=0.01) than RM group treated with clopidogrel 75 mg. The EM group also had significantly higher AM exposure by AUC(0-last) than the RM group (LS means 12.6 vs. 7.7; p=0.0009). Conclusions: This is the first report of a POC genetic testing platform performing a comprehensive CYP2C19 polymorphism characterization in CAD patients and validating the genotypes against the PK and PD phenotype. There was a high concordance between the two platforms in measuring the star allele marker data. The POC genetic test identified EM and RM phenotypes based on 11 gene variants with high accuracy and predicted a reduced platelet inhibition in response to clop. A rapid, reliable POC CYP2C19 genetic test could make clop pharmacogenetic testing feasible for all patients.

%X Introduction: Sleep problems in young children are reported in up to 40% of families. Much of the research on sleep in young children has focused on aetiology, disorders and developing treatments. However, little is known about the typical sleep practices and beliefs of families in the Australian community, which can impact on help seeking and treatment uptake. Uptake of sleep interventions is important to understand due to the significant negative impact of poor parental and infant sleep described in the literature. Multiple paediatric sleep researchers have commented on the importance of understanding and engaging with the needs of families in order to provide acceptable, feasible, appropriate and sustainable information and interventions to lead to improved behaviour and health. Yet, no comprehensive assessments of community perspectives on sleep in young children exist in order to meet these needs. Method: An online survey of parents with children aged 6-18 months living in Australia (N = 1,828) asked about a range of sleep, child and parent variables, including child sleep behaviours, sleep information sources and use of common sleep intervention methods. Participants were recruited primarily via online social media and community organisations. Results: Descriptive data indicated low-uptake of some commonly recommended child sleep practices, such as supine sleep position (29%) and use of behavioural interventions for sleep problems, such as cry-itout (9%), controlled crying (40%) and camping out (14%). Prevalence rates of parent-reported sleep problems aligned with current literature (40%). Of 698 parents who considered sleep a problem for their child, 61% had spoken to a Child Health Nurse, 40% to a GP and significantly less to other health practitioners. Parents rated paediatric sleep information presented in postnatal classes more highly than antenatal classes. Discussion: This exploratory study reveals community perspectives and practices in relation to the sleep of young children in Australia. Some findings suggest that health information is not being sourced by parents. This may be due to a lack of education or information provision, or a misalignment with family beliefs or needs. Findings will be used, alongside other project data, to develop recommendations for improvements in information, services and interventions for families with young children experiencing sleep issues.

%X The purpose of this paper is to present our experience of activities of formation and information on security and health prevention implemented during the last 10 years in a big hospital (700 beds and 1800 employees). The formation and information activities have been developed with a multidisciplinary collaboration and implemented using many different communication techniques: formal lessons, videos, tutoring, practical activities, questionnaires and posters. For some specific working risks the chief nurse has been provided with a multimedia support in order to form and check the knowledge acquired by the staff. The final evolution of this project is an E-learning platform that can exploit the informatics system of the Hospital.

%X Background: Over the last 25 years, the transfusion medicine community has focused its efforts on preventing the transmission of infectious diseases. We have done an outstanding job in greatly reducing this risk. We are now beginning to shift more of our focus to the safety of bedside blood administration. We must implement measures to assure that the right patient is safely transfused with the right blood product every time. Study: Our hospital purchased a high fi delity human simulator which simulates authentic patient situations. The mannequin can produce computer generated physiologic responses (heart sounds, breath sounds, cardiac rhythms, etc) and has a computerized voice. The mannequin is housed in a private training room. He uses “mocked up” blood made from distilled water mixed with red food coloring. Our education department worked in conjunction with our transfusion services manager and several nurse educators to develop a blood administration simulation excercise for new nursing graduates. The learner objectives for the excercise are as follows: 1) Demonstrate nursing procedures for blood product transfusion from physician order to completion of transfusion. 2) Recognize the most common opportunities for error during the transfusion process. 3) Refl ect on ways that complacency can creep into routine procedures. The participants walk through the entire process, including checking orders in the electronic medical record, drawing the patient's sample for blood bank testing, walking to the blood bank to pick up the blood, administering the blood, and completing post-transfusion procedures. Conclusion: We have completed this excercise with several groups of new nursing graduates. The responses have been very positive. The new nurses reveal that they receive very little to no “hands on” experience with blood administration while in nursing school. They very much appreciate the chance to walk through the entire process, and they convey that their confidence level with this procedure is greatly enhanced after completing the simulation. We will continue to utilize this excercise with new nursing graduates. In addition, next year we will take this to the next level and will develop a modified version of this excercise for nursing skills fairs. Experienced nurses have expressed a desire for a hands on annual refresher in blood administration. We currently use e-Learning modules to accomplish annual nursing in-service education for this procedure.

%X Rationale: To increase focus, knowledge and interprofessional work concerning nutritional screening of hospitalised patients through an e-learning course. To integrate a nutritional strategy in the treatment plan, and support the implementation of accredited standards. Methods: The e-learning course was made available in the hospital's learning management system (LMS); a software application for administration, documentation, tracking and reporting of different IT-based programs. The course consisted of 13 multiple choice questions based on guidelines from the Danish National Board of Health. The course contains a help function, drawings, a case etc. to support different learning styles. The course is passed when all questions are answered correctly. Pilot tests showed it took 10 minutes on average to complete the course. A total of 1415 staff members among doctors, dieticians, nurses, social and healthcare assistants have been selected to complete the course over 1 1 2 years. Results: Three months after the course was launched 254 members of staff had completed the course. In May 2011 this number had increased to 825. Conclusion: There has been an increased focus on nutritional screening after the launch of the e-learning course. An e-learning course fits the busy work schedules of hospital staff, is a flexible way of learning, and is easily updated as new knowledge emerges. The course is now part of the nutrition curriculum for clinical education of health care professionals at our hospital and a part of an individual competence development strategy.

%X Little is known regarding the feasibility and efficacy of an online continuing education program for oncology nurses. The Multiple Myeloma Mentorship Program, a quality improvement project for the Institute for Medical Education and Research, was designed to meet the educational needs of oncology nurses caring for patients with multiple myeloma. Twenty-five expert nurses with expertise in multiple myeloma from 23 cancer centers in the United States partnered with 50 oncology nurses in an electronic format from July 2009 to January 2010. The purpose of the program was to educate oncology nurses about the latest treatments and strategies for optimal side-effect management for patients with multiple myeloma. Nurse mentees selected their preferred form of learning-webcast, in-person speaker, or monograph. Two live webcasts allowed for didactic discussion between mentors and mentees. During and after the program, mentors conducted informal, unscripted interviews with nurse participants to determine preferred learning format, challenges, and implications for practice. Twelve nurses preferred Web-based learning to in-person presentations, citing flexibility and convenience as reasons for that choice. Time constraints with Web-based and in-person learning were a barrier to nurse mentees completing assigned modules. Several nurses implemented practice changes as a result of the program. Nurses who participated in the mentorship program were satisfied with the content. Learning styles and format should be considered in future mentorship programs.

%X Objective. In 2015 an online SLE Survey, directed to Italian patients, was carried out by Lupus Italy to investigate perception of chronic illness and the most serious difficulties in everyday life, due to disease itself and to medications. The Survey was also designed to assess chronic pain impact and how patients deal with it. Difficulties related to quality and conditions of health-care provision in Italy were investigated as well. Design and Method. Questionnaire core items (age, gender, geographic data, disease duration, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, disability degree, care practices, etc.) were set for sample features mapping. Specific items explored subjective incidence and characteristics of pain, e.g. primary or secondary to SLE, and its treatment, if any. The online version was created through Qualtrics platform. SLE patients throughout Italy were informed by social media and other channels (mailing list, website, Facebook); running period of the questionnaire on Gruppo LES Italiano website was April 2015. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Due to data collection method, the Survey represented mainly patients having access to Internet. Results. About 550 SLE patients provided comprehensive answers, 94.7% women, 5.3% men; mean age 33 y. (14-82 y. range); 84% received first SLE diagnosis mean age 29 y.(18-42 y. range); very early diagnosis (3-4 y.) up to extremely late diagnosis (>60 y.) were reported; 36% stated comorbidity with 1 up to 6 other autoimmune diseases, mainly APS. Majority declared relevant SLE impact on life, underlining specific problems and needs at different disease stages. Stress is important and worsens illness conditions. Family relational problems are frequent. Perceived need for psychological support covers 54%, but only 25% receives specific advice from physicians. Osteo-articular pain is the main symptom reported (83%). Only 54% use drugs for pain control; physicians seem not to be fully responding to patients' request to take into account the impact of pain. Women workers face many difficulties due to combined factors, which severely reduce access to proper care: lack of dedicated care units and nursing facilities, exclusion from exemption tables for several drug categories, economic barriers and work constraints. Conclusions. Current healthcare models do not meet patients' complex needs, thus strongly affecting quality of life and doctor-patient relationship. The Survey highlights the importance of physicians' clinical competence and ability to manage patient's crisis moments, in order to deal together with the course of a chronic illness. From 2016 Gruppo LES Italiano will periodically submit an online SLE Survey to the Italian patients, with the aim of better deepening the critical areas arisen in 2015 and providing to disclose the results to all the Institutions involved in social-health policies decision-making.

%X NICE recommends that people with diabetes receive structured education and support to enable them to manage their disease. It advocates annual retinal and neuropathy screening. Our audit aimed to assess the level of diabetic awareness in patients visiting our department. We received 104 replies: 74 per cent of responders were below65 years of age and46per centweremale. Over 55per centof the patients were from ethnic minorities. In all, 53 per cent of patients had Type 2 diabetes but 18 per cent did not knowwhat type of diabetes they had; 51 per cent responders had diabetes over 10 years. Only 82 per cent of patients admitted taking medications every day. The remaining 18 per cent admitted to taking medications occasionally, never or left the questions blank. The reasons for poor compliance were too busy, forgetting, feeling sick, but most were left blank. Over 42 per cent of responders did not know their HbA1c or left the question blank. Over 23 per cent of patientsmarked three or more complications (eye, renal, feet, IHD, HTN). Nearly 30 per cent of patients were not aware of annual retinal screening and over 42 per cent of responders were not aware of an annual feet check or left the question blank. This audit suggested that our patients are not well educated. Despite educational input from specialist nurses, dietitians and doctors and education programmes (HIDAP andX-PERT) furtherwork is still needed. Future plans include patient leaflets, which meet cultural and linguistic needs within our local area. We are planning to perform another questionnaire to ask how patients want to be educated. Finally we are considering online information and e-learning platforms for patients with diabetes on the hospital website.

%X Background: The Center for Global Education Initiatives (CGEI) at the University of Maryland Baltimore's (UMB), formerly the Global Health Resource Center, was established in 2005 under the NIH Fogarty Center's “Framework Program for Global Health” grant program to build interprofessional global health capacity on graduate campuses. CGEI provides UMB faculty and students from across the seven UMB professional schools (medicine, law, social work, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy and the graduate program in life sciences) with a variety of mechanisms that encourage joint scholarship, educational opportunities, and fellowship. Structure/Method/Design: CGEI has been remarkably successful in creating a platform for faculty and students to interact and develop multidisciplinary research themes and training programs in global health through three ways: 1) an interprofessional experiential learning program, 2) an active global health interprofessional faculty council (GHIC) that convenes monthly to share and advance coordinated campus efforts, and 3) a global health interprofessional student council. Outcome: CGEI implemented a pilot interprofessional program in 2010, involving one student from each school in a six-week research program in Malawi, led by faculty members of different disciplines. After four years of interprofessional educational success, the program expanded into a broader model; in 2014 and 2015, 78 students were supported in 18 different projects in 11 countries. Primarily through GHIC, faculty members are brought together from within the University as well as with international collaborators to formulate research proposals that go across disciplines and reframe solutions for global health challenges. Faculty and students return to UMB to share their experiences with their peers which continues the excitement and demand for meaningful interprofessional experiential opportunities. CGEI has been able to effectively connect students to faculty members interested in global health across campus. Previously, students organized themselves around global health issues by schools but the groups were not engaged with one another. CGEI established a Global Student Advisory Council that brought together representatives from each school's interest group, and they now coordinate substantive events and opportunities to encourage interprofessional fellowship. Going Forward: CGEI continues to develop and evolve to support UMB faculty and students and meet the increasing demand for meaningful interprofessional global health opportunities.

%X Nurses must be prepared to care for patients following a disaster, including patients exposed to hazardous contaminants. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of virtual reality simulation (VRS) to teach the disaster-specific skill of decontamination. A quasi-experimental design was used to assign nursing students from 2 baccalaureate nursing programs to 1 of 2 groups to learn the disaster skill of decontamination-printed written directions or VRS. Performance, knowledge, and self-efficacy were outcome measures. Although students in the treatment group had significantly lower performance scores than the control group (p = 0.004), students taking part in VRS completed the skill in a significantly shorter amount of time (p = 0.008). No significant group differences were found for self-efficacy (p = 0.172) or knowledge (p = 0.631). However, students in the VRS treatment group reported high levels of satisfaction with VRS as a training method. The disaster-specific skill of decontamination is a low-volume, high-risk skill that must be performed with accuracy to protect both exposed patients and providers performing decontamination. As frontline providers for casualties following a disaster event, emergency nurses must be prepared to perform this skill when needed. Preparation requires cost-effective, timely, and evidence-based educational opportunities that promote positive outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine the benefits and long-term effects of VRS for disaster education.

The study used a longitudinal experimental design using two groups and repeated measures. A convenience sample of associate degree nursing students enrolled in a disaster course was randomized into two groups; both groups completed web-based modules; the treatment group also completed a virtually simulated disaster experience. Learning was measured using a 20-question multiple-choice knowledge assessment pre/post and at 2 months following training. Results were analyzed using the generalized linear model. Independent and paired t tests were used to examine the between- and within-participant differences. The main effect of the virtual simulation was strongly significant (p&.0001). The VRS effect demonstrated stability over time. In this preliminary examination, VRS is an instructional method that reinforces learning and improves learning retention. © The Author(s) 2012.

%X Virtual reality simulation as a teaching method is gaining increased acceptance and presence in institutions of higher learning. This study presents an innovative strategy using the interdisciplinary development of a nonimmersive virtual reality simulation to facilitate interprofessional communication. The purpose of this pilot project was to describe nursing students' attitudes related to interprofessional communication following the collaborative development of a disaster triage virtual reality simulation. Collaboration between and among professionals is integral in enhancing patient outcomes. In addition, ineffective communication is linked to detrimental patient outcomes, especially during times of high stress. Poor communication has been identified as the root cause of the majority of negative sentinel events occurring in hospitals. The simulation-development teaching model proved useful in fostering interprofessional communication and mastering course content. Mean scores on the KidSIM Attitudes Towards Teamwork in Training Undergoing Designed Educational Simulation survey demonstrated that nursing students, after simulation experience,had agreement to strong agreement inall areas surveyed including interprofessional education, communication, roles and responsibilities of team members, and situational awareness. The findings indicate that students value interprofessional teamwork and the opportunity to work with other disciplines.

%X DESIGN: A seven step instrument development design was implemented that included content validity and reliability as well as inter-rater reliability analysis. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of approximately 140 participants was drawn from two colleges of nursing at two large academic universities. The sample included senior nursing students in either their community or final practicum nursing course. METHODS: Based on a sample of 140 students who participated in a decontamination training experience using virtual reality simulation, a seven step established process for assessment of reliability and validity was implemented to develop a checklist for the skill of decontamination. RESULTS: The final instrument statistics: Content Validity Index for the overall instrument score was 0.94, Internal consistency coefficient=0.607(KR-20) and Inter-rater reliability=0.9114. CONCLUSIONS: This instrument provides a reliable and valid assessment of nurses' competency in performing the skill of decontamination offering a template for educators to develop similar tools. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nurses must competently demonstrate psychomotor skills. Few reliable and valid instruments are available for psychomotor evaluation for disaster skills, including the skill of decontamination. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and refine an instrument to measure the skill of decontamination.

%X Librarians at the Mayo Clinic developed customized Web 2.0 courses for library staff, health science faculty, and nurse educators. As demand for this type of training spread across the institution, a single, self-paced class was developed for all employees. The content covered the typical Web 2.0 and social media tools (e.g., blogs, really simple syndication [RSS], wikis, social networking tools) emphasizing the organization's social media guidelines. The team consulted with the public affairs department to develop the class and coordinate marketing and advertising. The eight-module, blog-based course was introduced to all employees in 2010. Employees completing each module and passing a brief assessment receive credit on their employee transcript. Libraries staff provided support to participants throughout the duration of the course through chat widgets, e-mail, and blog comments. The results show that even though a high number of learners accessed the course, the completion percentage was low since there was no requirement to complete the course. Deploying a single, self-paced course for a large institution is an enormous undertaking, requiring the support of high level administration, managers, and employees. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

%X AIMS OF PROJECT: To evaluate a workshop to prepare health professionals for breaking bad news in the paediatric setting. BACKGROUND: Breaking bad news can be difficult for health professionals, and it seems that few receive specific training for undertaking this challenging task. Latterly, however, there have been reports of training programmes being developed to prepare health professionals for breaking bad news, although most focus upon meeting needs of medical staff only. While doctors have a uniquely important role in breaking bad news it is evident that other health professionals, most frequently nurses, can be equally involved in this encounter. Accordingly, nurses and other professionals need training to recognize the contribution that they can make in ensuring sensitive and effective bad news disclosure. DESIGN: A one-day, multi-professional, experiential training workshop. METHOD: Forty-five participants, mainly nurses (34, 76%) and doctors (10, 22%), attended one of five breaking bad news workshops set up for staff working in a range of paediatric settings including Accident and Emergency and Intensive Care. Each of the workshops was facilitated by three facilitators from varied backgrounds. Using an experiential design, participants were supported to explore and reflect upon breaking bad news issues, which also included engagement with actors to act out realistic bad news scenarios. Debriefing, using a positive learner-centred model of feedback, provided the main platform for promoting learning. Following the workshop, participants completed an evaluation questionnaire, seeking their perceptions of the effectiveness of the workshop in enhancing knowledge and communication skills. DATA ANALYSIS: Atlas.ti, a qualitative computer data analysis software program was used to explore the evaluation comments made by participants, resulting in the generation of common themes. FINDINGS: Seven themes, including development of practice, the value of sharing, benefit of feedback, and team work, emerged from responses. All responses indicated that the workshop had been beneficial and an effective training method, with most participants (40 of 89%) indicating that they would strongly recommend their colleagues to attend a similar workshop. CONCLUSION: The educational approach reported is considered by participants to be beneficial in preparing health professionals for breaking bad news in a collaborative way.

%X Introduction: LUNAR (Lung Cancer Nurse Resource and Academy) is an educational programme available for all UK nurses working with lung cancer patients. It aims to assist nurses in the management of toxicities associated with Erlotinib. Lung Nurse Specialists (LNS) are best placed, as part of the multi-disciplinary team, to provide co-ordination and continuity of care for patients with lung cancer (Moore S 2009). Nationally the majority of patients receiving Erlotinib are reviewed by Clinicians whilst maintaining links with their Lung Nurse Specialist (LUNAR Committee meeting 04.09). Whilst these patients appear to be well supported 'in hours' by Clinicians and LNS's it raises concerns about how this group of patients are cared for 'out of hours'. The NCAG report which recommends a review of chemotherapy delivery, can be seen as an opportunity to utilise the nursing workforce more efficiently, to both contribute, and enable safe, quality care. Method: As the only Chemotherapy Nurse Specialist representative on the LUNAR committee an opportunity was identified for chemotherapy nurses and LNS's to work collaboratively across the Kent and Medway Cancer Network (KMCN) using LUNAR as a platform. Two workshops were organised for the Lung Nurse Specialists working across the KMCN. Patients need to be properly informed about treatment side effects and toxicities (Lennan E, 2009); LUNAR offers the opportunity to educate nurses on these specifics. Results: The workshops gave us an opportunity to share case studies and best practice models. As a result two models of practice have been developed in Kent: 1. LNS led review, with back-up from the Chemotherapy Nursing service 'out of hours'. 2. Chemotherapy Nurse led review 24/7, through close liaison with the LNS. The pathway has been revised to incorporate a nurse led clinic review at 2/52, following a review of the toxicities reported within the first two weeks of commencing treatment. Conclusion: A collaborative approach enables care delivery to be streamlined and standardises practice. Future plans include evaluating the service via patient and staff questionnaires, and auditing the management of toxicities.

%X Purpose: eviQ Cancer Treatments Online (http://www.eviq.org.au) provides evidence based cancer treatment information applicable to the Australian clinical environment, for cancer health professionals, primary care clinicians, cancer patients and their carers. Radiation oncology information on eviQ is tailored for radiation oncologists/ registrars, radiation therapists, nurses and medical physicists, and includes pre-treatment, simulation, dosing, target volume/contouring examples, efficacy/toxicity, side effects and patient information. Methods and materials: The eviQ platform includes a reporting mechanism to record de-identified statistical information on website usage. Registration and usage data was evaluated between Oct 2009 - Jan 2012. The development of treatment protocols complies with the eviQ Content Development Governance Framework,1 and requires clinical expertise and input from the four radiation oncology disciplines. Since October 2009 eviQ has been actively promoted throughout Australia. Results: Since the launch of eviQ in 2009, registrations have consistently increased across all content areas. Radiation oncology registrations have increased 870 % from 147 to 1426 between October 2009 and January 2012. Radiation oncologists and registrars/Fellows represented 9.7% and 7.2% respectively of all radiation oncology users. Over 60% of radiation oncologists report they have more than five years experience. The most viewed radiation oncology protocols are Head and Neck Contouring Guidelines (n = 616), Breast, Adjuvant Conservative Short Course (n = 785), Prostate, Definitive High Risk EBRT (n = 866), Colorectal, Rectum Pre-Op Long Course (n = 902), Management of Acute Skin Reactions (n = 1016) and Breast Long Course Protocol (n = 1493). Conclusion: eviQ is accessed by radiation oncology health professionals from all states and territories across Australia and internationally. Interestingly, eviQ radiation oncology content is primarily being utilised by clinicians with more than five years clinical experience. Formal evaluation of eviQ utilisation is currently underway, with provisional data suggesting radiation oncology information is utilised across metropolitan, regional and remote settings. Continued engagement of clinical experts throughout NSW and across Australia will further embed eviQ use into daily clinical practice.

%X The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) found that 65% of medical sentinel events or medical errors are associated with communication breakdowns. In addition to the JCAHO, The Institute of Medicine, in their Core Competencies for health care professional education, recommend improvement in professional communication, collaboration, and a patient-centered approach to provide safety. Consistency of opportunities for students to practice their communication and collaboration skills is limited based on the variety of clinical experiences that are available. Simulation would provide consistency in students' experiences. Students can practice giving a structured report, providing and receiving peer feedback, and obtaining patient feedback in a safe setting through a simulation experience. A structured hand-off shift report using a technique such as SBAR communication has been found to improve patient safety in health care environments. This paper examines the implementation of a simulation experience for students taking a Mental Health course in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Program to support their practice of patient and professional communication, as well as, collaboration skills with a patient-centered approach using a standardized patient simulation. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

%X Topic Significance & Study Purpose/Background/Rationale: In 2010 our BMT program restructured to merge the individual autologous and allogeneic transplant teams to form a unified Adult Transplant Service. In anticipation of the expected programmatic and patient volume growth (Table 1), we identified a need for more efficient communication amongst the staff across the patient care continuum. In this newly structured BMT program, patients frequently transition between the inpatient and outpatient care settings; however, the RN and Advanced Practice Provider (APP) staff does not rotate. Therefore, effective lines of communication are essential to provide safe and efficient patient care. Historically, there was no platform for staff to collaborate and problem solve when issues arose with continuity of patient care and flow through these diverse settings. Methods, Intervention, & Analysis: The Nurse Leader of Transplant Services facilitated a monthly Inpatient/Outpatient (IPOP) meeting in 2010 to address continuity of care and patient flow issues. The initial meetings included the small group of nurses within the transplant service and two physician collaborators. As the program evolved and clinical staff increased (Table 2), it became apparent that efficient communication across the care continuum involved more disciplines and the meeting matured into its current membership, which includes: nurses, APPs, physicians, case managers, social workers and nutritionists. A formal monthly meeting schedule was established, which includes a record of attendance and distribution of minutes. Agenda items are gathered throughout the month as questions and issues arise in daily operations. Findings & Interpretation: Since the institution of regular IPOP meetings there have been several improvements on the BMT service, evident in our forms of communication, ability to problem solve, and collegiality among the staff. This platform has allowed us to identify issues and formulate solutions in an effective, efficient manner. Furthermore, this forum for discussion and collaboration has provided insight and appreciation of the workflows and challenges encountered by the represented groups. Discussion & Implications: Our IPOP meetings allow us to adjust to the ever changing needs of our service and patients. The IPOP forum can be adapted for use in other transplant centers to provide an approach to more efficient care and communication, which ultimately can improve patient and staff satisfaction.

%X The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) uses social media to reach the hidden and hard to reach population of men having sex with men (MSM). The SMDHU INFOnurseX profile went live on www.squirt.org in May 2012. A public health nurse is available online for a total of five hours per week; Monday to Friday from 2:30pm to 3:30pm, to engage users in sexual health discussions and respond to questions. Users can interact with the PHN via instant messaging/email or the message board. Message boards are also used to communicate clinics offered by the health unit such as the Men only Drop-In clinic and the Anonymous Rapid HIV Drop-In clinic. A large percentage of MSM in Simcoe Muskoka are still not out publicly regarding their sexual orientation or practices and having a nurse online provides a discreet way for MSM to access information from a credible source. Our goal is to raise awareness among MSM about risk factors for STIs, the signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, the importance of testing, and to encourage safer sex practices. E-blast messages are another tool used to engage the online population. Approximately 2000 men receive our messages in Simcoe Muskoka and on average 300-400 people open and read our eblast message. This is a new outreach environment for public health and we have seen a steady increase in the number of MSM accessing our clinic services since May 2012. This unique initiative provides an on-going, discreet opportunity for men to ask questions and receive information in a confidential online environment. In 2014, SMDHU received the Judges Award for Innovation as part of Canada Health Infoway's Public Health Social Media Challenge for this initiative.

%X Aim: To report an analysis of the concept of perinatal bereavement. Background: The concept of perinatal bereavement emerged in the scientific literature during the 1970s. Perinatal bereavement is a practice-based concept, although it is not well-defined in the scientific literature and is often intermingled with the concepts of mourning and grief. Design: Concept Analysis. Data sources: Using the term 'perinatal bereavement' and limits of only English and human, Pub Med and CINAHL were searched to yield 278 available references dating from 1974-2011. Articles specific to the experience of perinatal bereavement were reviewed. The final data set was 143 articles. Review methods: The methods of principle-based concept analysis were used. Results reveal conceptual components (antecedents, attributes and outcomes) which are delineated to create a theoretical definition of perinatal bereavement. Results: The concept is epistemologically immature, with few explicit definitions to describe the phenomenon. Inconsistency in conceptual meaning threatens the construct validity of measurement tools for perinatal bereavement and contributes to incongruent theoretical definitions. This has implications for both nursing science (how the concept is studied and theoretically integrated) and clinical practice (timing and delivery of support interventions). Conclusions: Perinatal bereavement is a multifaceted global phenomenon that follows perinatal loss. Lack of conceptual clarity and lack of a clearly articulated conceptual definition impede the synthesis and translation of research findings into practice. A theoretical definition of perinatal bereavement is offered as a platform for researchers to advance the concept through research and theory development. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Background: Hope is widely regarded as essential to the emotional health of cancer pts, yet remains under-studied. We sought to explore the concept of hope and develop a teaching module to educate providers about the importance of hope in optimizing oncology care. Methods: We audio recorded interviews with oncology patients. Questions focused on what hope means, the role it plays in their ability to manage their illness, and ways in which they felt oncology providers could engender hope and positively impact their experience. We also interviewed oncology providers, including physicians, nurses, and social workers. Questions focused on the role they feel hope plays for their pts, whether or not they have received training in how to discuss hope, and tools they use to discuss hope with their pts. Common themes were extracted to form the backbone of a webcast-style teaching module. Results: A total of 24 volunteers were enrolled in an IRB approved protocol. One half of the subjects were pts and the other half were oncology providers (n = 6 physicians, 3 nurses, 3 social workers). Hope emerged as an important element to good quality of life in 12/12 (100%) pts. The overwhelming majority (11/12, 92%) further expressed that feeling “well cared for” as well as receiving clear, honest information about their disease greatly increased their hopefulness. Hope also was recognized as essential to pts' wellness and ability to manage their illness by all 12 (100%) of the providers. Although all providers recognized hope as essential to their pts, only the social workers reported that they had received some level of training in how to discuss hope, while the physicians and nurses felt that they had received little to no training. All providers expressed desire to contribute positively to their pts' sense of hope. Conclusions: Both pts and providers view hope as a vital element in how oncology pts manage their illness. This point of connection between providers and their pts offers a mechanism to enhance the care of patients and impact their overall experience with cancer, yet most providers have little to no training in how to discuss hope. Development of an education module is underway to help increase awareness of the importance of hope and teach providers strategies to better engage with their pts on the subject of hope.

%X Purpose: This paper presents a novel approach of computer-assisted learning for nursing education in university undergraduate courses. Background: The most innovative aspect of the proposal is the design of nursing assignments as on-line competitions. The effects of competitive e-learning versus conventional teaching methods on the acquisition and retention of knowledge were compared in a course on medical-surgical nursing. Method: A total of 116 students of mixed gender, age, computer experience and educational background in a second-year course on medical-surgical nursing participated in the study. Data were collected from nursing students at four time points. The on-line activities were carried out using a web-based automatic evaluation system. Results: The study revealed that the competitive e-learning method produced significant cognitive gains for the experimental group students in the immediate follow-up test. Nevertheless, both teaching methods resulted in similar knowledge retention in the 10-week follow-up test. Conclusion: Significant benefits were found following our approach. The work of the students could be evaluated along the course, the workload of instructors was reduced and students received immediate feedback by the on-line judge, which promoted both independent learning and reflective thinking. The approach is applicable to any other nursing educational institution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Our 24hr palliative care platform provides continuity of specialist care for patients and families. Initial contact is by phone. Most consulting reasons can be dealt with telephone advice; other times, Pal24 professionals request a Emergency Services Nurse or Doctor for a face to face assessment or intervention. In 2012, 6 educational workshops on using the Subcutaneous Route, were organized after a significant event occurred. Aim: Establish the perceived impact that SC route workshops or any other Palliative Care training Courses have had on nurses perception on their confidence when attending End of Life situations. To assess the evolution of number of Nursing Units needed mobilizing by Pal24 over last 4 and a half years. Methods: (1) A descriptive study of the number of ER nursing Units mobilized from the 24hr platform (2) Analysis of a telephone survey undertaken over a 3 day period by Pal24 professionals to 20 nurses working in Emergency Services. Results: For nearly 90.000 contacts since Pal24 went live, 410 Nursing Units were mobilized in 2011, 631 in 2012, 581 in 2013, 803 in 2014 and 410 from 1st of January to 30th of June 2015. Results from the survey have shown that 65% of nurses felt comfortable managing end of life situations always or nearly always. 70% had completed a Palliative Care training course, 50% of these, the SC Route Workshops. 50% felt that training had changed the way they worked with Medical Units. All of them would like to receive further training. Conclusions: A progressive increment in the number of nursing units mobilized is observed, in parallel with the increasing number of Pal24 interventions. This study shows how a single educational intervention can help improve perception of confident management of end of life situations and of better coordination with other professionals. Further impulse of accredited educational activities is essential to promote a continuous improvement and development of Palliative Care.

%X The Spanish society of neonatal nursing is a nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering the development of Neonatal Nursing organization. Among its objectives are the following: - Create links between the different profesionals dedicated to newborn and family care. - Ensure career advancement for all partners. - Organizing all kinds of social, cultural and scientific activities related to the activities of the SEEN and sponsor the ones organized by members. - Implement the creation of a body of knowledge through the creation of committees and commissions, constituted to deal with particular aspects of Neonatal Nursing. - To promote recognition of the specialty of Neonatal Nursing in the workplace both as an academic. Since 2004 SEEN has organized five national congresses of neonatal nursing and participated as a partner in many more, becoming a meeting point of reference for nurses dedicated to care for the newborn and his family. From this position SEEN aims to become a facilitator of development, not only as discipline but also the individual neonatal nurses, promoting research networks, providing assistance to scientific activities and collaborating in training and academic activities. By the close ties we have with national and international organizations we aim to become a platform to facilitate the international projection of the Spanish neonatal nurses.

%X OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and student acceptance of using a human patient simulation (HPS) training module focused on interdisciplinary teamwork skills. DESIGN: During their second-professional year, all pharmacy students were in enrolled in Principles of Pharmacotherapy 4: Cardiovascular Diseases and Patient Care Lab IV, a problem-based learning course. As part of the patient care laboratory, students participated in a simulated case of an acutely ill patient with a hypertensive emergency. During the simulation, students performed a history and physical examination. They then worked as a team to make treatment recommendations to the nursing and physician staff members. Following the exercise, a facilitated debriefing session was conducted. Students completed satisfaction surveys to assess the quality and effectiveness of the session. ASSESSMENT: Over 98% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they learned material relevant to their current studies. When compared to student lectures, 90% of students felt that they learned clinical patient care better when using a HPS mannequin in simulated patient scenarios. CONCLUSION: HPS-based learning offers a realistic training experience through which clinical knowledge and interpersonal teamwork skills can be taught. Students enjoy the experience and find it relevant to their future practice. Simulation-based training may teach certain topics better than traditional lecture formats and as such could help to fill gaps in the current pharmacy curriculum.

%X OBJECTIVE: This work sought to analyze the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and social networks among the university nursing faculty staff in Spain. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study using a questionnaire on ICT skills designed to comply with the research objective, which was evaluated by experts and which was subjected to exploratory analysis of principal components; the reliability of this instrument measured with Cronbach's alpha was 0.85. The information technology tool used to publish the questionnaire on line was Limesurvey. The sample comprised 165 professors from 25 Nursing Faculties and Schools from universities in Spain. RESULTS: Seventy one percent of the total surveyed used internet services to look for information, 63% used the internet as a means for formation and learning, and 72% used it as a communication platform (e-mail and virtual platforms like Sakai and Moodle). Although 51% of the teaching staff surveyed had more than 120 students registered in their courses, hypothesis testing revealed that the number of students in class is not a determining factor for the teaching staff to have greater interest to update its knowledge in ICTs. Younger professors use new technologies more profusely and the most-valued advantage of using ICTs was quick access to information. Professors perceive that after the Bologna Declaration, which requires modifying their teaching-learning processes through the new teaching methodologies, a drop has been produced in their performance and that of their peers in their area of knowledge. CONCLUSION: The nursing teaching staff is making strong efforts to confront the new challenges posed by ICTs to train the professionals of the 21st century. It is fundamental to pay special attention to improving the university teaching staff's skills in managing ICTs, promoting the implementation of the knowledge acquired.

%X Purpose: The realization of electrocardiograms (EKG) is a basic test, very common and very important in any disease, so the nursing staff in cardiology proposed to increase the knowledge of both the technical realization, and the interpretation of ECG to all the nursing staff of the Heart Unit Management in our hospital. As stated objectives we established: 1. Conduct two refresher courses for nursing in electrocardiography and Rating them. 2. Improved technique in performing and electrocardiographyc rating. 3. Increase knowledge in electrocardiographic interpretation. Method: We followed a descriptive, longitudinal study with assessment pre and post-educational training. The performance followed the following steps: Teacher training group composed of five nurses from the cardiology department. Development program to perform the two courses. Evaluation of the knowledge test before the course. Theoretical and practical classes taught by the heart unit management nursing team to support written and audiovisual materials. Assessment knowledge test after the course. And last Test of student satisfaction, and evaluation of completed test. Results: The formation courses was given for four days and with a duration of four hours, completed with e-learning exercises at home. Participation in training was a total of 24 nurses and 8 nurses assistants (n = 32). Knowledge Test: nurses evaluation: before 58%, after 85%. Nursing assistants: before 31%, after 62%. Satisfaction test: Nurses: average 9.1 points (1 to 10). Nurses assistants: average of 9.3 points. Conclusions: Surveys have shown a subsequent significant increase in knowledge of 27% nurses and assistants in 31%. Likewise it could be seen an improvement in the technique of the embodiment of the electrocardiogram. In view of the good results, the effort in the design, development and delivery of courses was a high degree of satisfaction with teachers and students, seeing a need for further teaching duties at present. We propose to expand their implementation to other hospital units. It is very important to empasize the importance of better understanding in electrocardiographyfor nurses, as we are the only proffessionals who are at the bedside 24 hours a day,every days of the year, proving essential in the earliest cardiological complications detection, adding value to this activities.

%X Despite recent and exponential improvements in diagnostic-therapeutic pathways, an existing “GAP” has been revealed from the “real world care” and the “optimal care” of patients with heart failure (HF). We present the T.O.S.CA Project (Trattamento Ormonale dello Scompenso CArdiaco), an Italian multicenter initiative aiming to explore the HF “metabolic pathophysiological model” and to improve the quality of care in HF. Research/Aims. a) To give reference values for the diagnosis of Low IGF-1 syndrome in HF patients and to evaluate the prevalence of low GH/IGF-1 activity in this population; b) To monitor HF progression with respect to change in IGF-1 activity in a 2-years multicenter longitudinal study, in order to evaluate IGF-1 as a possible prognosis marker for HF; c) To identify the correlations between IGF-1 and other hormonal values (thyroid hormones, androgen axis, insulin-resistance), as well as the correlations between IGF- 1 and morphological (ventricular volumes, ventricular mass) and functional indexes (ergospirometric parameters) in HF patients; d) To study the relation between histological parameters, myocardial gene expression profile, and the anabolic/catabolic balance in endomyocardial biopsies of HF patients undergoing cardiac surgery; e) To evaluate GH therapy in HF patients with low IGF-1 levels and a good response to IGF-1 generation test, in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial; f) To investigate possible multiple replacement therapies (GH, testosterone) and to test clinically the multiple hormonal and metabolic deficiency syndrome (MHD) model. Education/Aims. To improve the quality of care of HF patients (timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness) in different clinical settings. It consists of a specialized education continuing medical (ECM) meta-model designed by a dedicated multidisciplinary team and applied through an intensive educational year. Care/Aims. To develop a structured HF Management Program (HFMP) on the area of Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy as a continuum between the community hospital and the territorial health system serving 110.000 habitants among 13 cities. The HF out-patient clinic represents the platform of the Amalfi Coast HFMP, directed by clinical cardiologist and coordinated by registered nurse, along with multidisciplinary team (Fig. 1). Conclusions. The mission of the T.O.S.CA Project is to expand the bridge between research, education and care sharing best practices and resources in HF. (Graph presented).

%X Introduction There is significant interest in Cancer Care Coordination Program (CCCP) to improve transitions of care by improving communication between stakeholders and providing patients' assistance. Use of health information technologies (HIT) can be combined with Nurse Coordinators (NC) to improve remote patient follow-up. Objectives Describing how to design a CCCP based on HIT (through a web portal) and NC. Methods The research was conducted within the CAPRI project which included design, implementation and evaluation of a CCCP. Three studies were conducted: 1.A patient survey to understand HIT use and intention to use for their health. 2.A qualitative analysis to understand the existing care processes and define how the CCCP could prevent difficulties and facilitate coordination. 3.An analysis of home care coordination activities to identify the necessary skills and tasks to perform home care coordination activities. Results 1371 questionnaires were returned. Patient attitudes toward e-health activities were mainly positive, particularly to have an access to ER, filling out a self-test, communicating, and scheduling appointment. 43 interviews were conducted. The qualitative analysis enabled to refine the features the CCCP could offer and highlighted the need to develop decision support tools for NC. 543 calls received at the coordination platform were analyzed. The majority of patients' and professionnals' needs were related to managerial and organizational issues. Conclusions These studies identified patient's needs and the main features expected by HIT. NC should have a role as a case manager in order to prevent risky situations. Operational since June 2016, they have helped to implement the CCCP for patient treated by oral therapy.

%X Frequently misdiagnosed as obesity, lipoedema is chronic condition involving an abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks that cannot be shifted by exercise or dieting. Estimated to affect up to 11% of the female population, the condition is widely unknown by health professionals. This means women typically wait for many years before diagnosis. This allows the condition to progress unchecked, resulting in unnecessary deterioration and the development of associated comorbidities, as well as significant pain and mental anguish. A free, 30-minute Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) e-learning course created in partnership with Lipoedema UK aims to rectify this situation by educating nurses, GPs and other health professionals on how to diagnose and manage lipoedema in primary care. This article aims to describe the condition of lipoedema, how to recognise/diagnose it, current treatment options and the findings of a 240-patient survey carried out by Lipoedema UK in 2013 that included documenting the difficulties for patients in obtaining a diagnosis as well as the mental and physical effects of the condition.

%X Background/Objectives: In the UK there have been a number of cases where parents have wanted non-standard therapy in the treatment of their child; the most notorious of these was a young boy whose parents took him overseas to try and force UK authorities to finance his proton therapy against medical opinion. Whilst thismay have an isolated incident the increasing level of information available via the internet - not always accurate or relevant - is influencing the decisions made by parents in relation to clinical trials. This paper will explore the issues concerning gaining informed consent in the digital age with particular reference to the role of the research nurse. Design/Methods: A literature review has been undertaken which demonstrates a paucity of research and other published high quality data in this area. However there are some opinion papers that discuss specific cases. By including this with related research data, published anecdotal accounts and discussion within wider research team we have drawn together the threads of the arguement and made some suggestions for good practice. Results: Parents gain knowledge concerning their child's treatment and prognosis from a wide variety of sources, these include the information provided by health care professionals, disease related Face Book pages, and of course the ubiquitous google search. The quality of this information is varaible. Parents do not always have the background knowledge to judge and appraise the information the discover. As one consultant said “There's a doctor that makes me very afraid and which influences patients. It's Doctor Google”. Conclusion: Research nurses are in a privileged position to help inform parent's decision making processes. They need to understand the changes that are occuring. Social media should be embraced rather than being seen as an enemy. Examples of this are dedicated twitter or Face book accounts, or the supplementation of information sheets with newer media e.g. You Tube.

%X Background: Palliative care services are lacking in rural hospitals. Implementing palliative care services in rural and remote areas requires knowledge of available resources, specific barriers, and a commitment from the hospital and community. Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine awareness, knowledge, barriers, and resources regarding palliative care services in rural hospitals. Methods: A descriptive survey design used an investigator-developed needs assessment to survey 374 (40% response rate) health care providers (chief executive officers, chiefs of medical staff, chief nursing officers, and social worker directors) at 236 rural hospitals (<100 beds) in seven Rocky Mountain states. Results: Significant barriers to integrating palliative care exist: lack of administrative support, mentorship, and access to palliative care resources; inadequate basic knowledge about palliative care strategies; and limited training/skills in palliative care. Having contractual relationships with local hospices is a key facilitator. Respondents (56%) want to learn more about palliative care, specifically focusing on pain management, communication techniques, and end-of-life care issues. Webinar and online courses were suggested as strategies to promote long distance learning. Conclusions: It is imperative for quality of care that rural hospitals have practitioners who are up to date on current evidence and practice within a palliative care framework. Unique challenges exist to implementing palliative care services in rural hospitals. Opportunities for informing rural areas focus around utilizing existing hospice resources and relationships, and favoring Web-based classes and online courses. The development of a multifaceted intervention to facilitate education about palliative care and cultivate palliative care services in rural settings is indicated. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X Background Adverse events associated with poor dose calculation skills among nurses on paediatric wards are frequent and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. An E-learning program has successfully been implemented in one paediatric ward in Denmark and is used for competency training and revision. Purpose To evaluate a nationwide up-scaling of an E-learning program on paediatric nurses' dose calculation skills. Materials and methods The intervention contained training on dose calculation skills using an E-learning program and a teaching session provided by the hospital pharmacy. Nurses in 8 paediatric wards throughout Denmark participated. Dose calculation skills were evaluated by a “before” and “after” test containing 15 generic calculation tasks. Nurse satisfaction with study participation was evaluated by a questionnaire survey. Results Of the 97 nurses completing the “before” test, only 36 (37%) completed the “after” test and 15 (42%) of those had trained 1 h or less using the E-learning program. The questionnaire was filled in by 55 nurses. The test results showed mean scores of 75.9% (pre-training) and 79.9% (post-training) of correct answers. According to the questionnaire survey, the majority of the nurses reported: improvement in their calculation skills (30 out of 54), satisfaction with the E-learning program (33 out of 36), satisfaction with the teaching lesson (36 out of 41) and satisfaction with the collaboration with the hospital pharmacy (47 out of 53). The majority were positive towards the E-learning program, test and teaching in the future. Conclusions The study found a tendency to improvement in dose calculation skills among nurses completing both tests, despite only a little training using the E-learning program. The majority of the participants were satisfied with the E-learning program and were positive towards it as a future initiative. However, the study completion rate was low suggesting that the up-scaling model needs further development for successful implementation.

%X Brief introduction to the topic: It is recognised that teachers who are excited by new technologies may use them without considering their impact on learning. Considering 'pedagogy before technology' may lead to more rational application of technologies within proven practices and models of teaching (Beetham & Sharpe, 2007). Emerging technologies represent a paradigm shift in education allowing democratisation of information, the generation of online, global communities and portability resulting from the ubiquity of personal mobile and wireless devices. These technologies thus represent an opportunity, but it is crucial that teachers using them assume both a creative and a critical approach to their implementation. Symposium Objectives: • Showcase examples of technological innovations being used globally to teach geriatric medicine • Summarise the core educational theories underpinning the use of technology-enhanced learning in its different forms • Highlight the added value that technological innovations offer • Acknowledge the barriers that may limit widespread implementation of innovative teaching Symposium Overview: - Using innovative teaching to tackle the big issues facing geriatric medicine (Adam Gordon) - Simulation (James Fisher) - e-Learning (Desmond O'Neill) - Social Media (Joanne Pattinson) Introductory Talk: Using innovative teaching to tackle the big issues facing geriatric medicine (Adam Gordon): The demographic imperative means that all doctors need to know about assessment and management of older patients with frailty. Consensus curricula for what we need to teach undergraduates about such patients have been published but are still not taught in many medical schools (Oakley et al, 2014). At a postgraduate level, there is the dual challenge of educating non-geriatricians about how to care for older patients and what to teach as part of higher medical training in geriatric medicine. Particular challenges are: making space in overcrowded syllabuses to cover complex topics related to ageing; addressing doctors' attitudes and behaviours towards older patients with frailty and the multidisciplinary teams who support them; and ensuring consistency of teaching when presentations in geriatric medicine are variable and evanescent. Innovative teaching approaches can allow these issues to be tackled by: taking information-dense didactic teaching outside of the normal working day to make space for more nuanced issues requiring faceto- face teaching (e-Learning); providing reproducible experiences without disadvantaging vulnerable patients (simulation); and providing students with safe fora within which to explore their and others' attitudes and beliefs (social media). These topics will be considered in turn by educators from around the UK who have used technology to change how and what their students learn. Sub-section 1: Simulation (James Fisher): Simulation mannequins for medical education were first used in the 1960's, since then rapid technological advances have resulted in the development of mannequins of increasing fidelity (Cooper and Taqueti, 2008). Subsequently, the use of simulation mannequins in medical education has gained acceptance (Gordon et al., 2004). The use of simulation to teach geriatric medicine has been described with specialty trainees (Birns et al., 2012, Dasgupta et al., 2012, Mehdi et al., 2014), multi-disciplinary groups of doctors and nurses (Ross et al., 2013) and medical students (Fisher and Walker, 2014). This sub-section will: • Describe existing simulation teaching programmes, including example video footage of such teaching. • Explore how teachers can develop scenarios “reflecting the messy realities and challenges of clinical practice” (Kneebone, 2009). The aspiration is that immersive simulation scenarios, showcasing the complexity of frail, multi-morbid older patients, can act as 'threshold concepts' for learners (Meyer and Land, 2005), and thus help students develop new perspectives on elderly care. • Discuss the debrief process during learning via simula io and share a debrief model: 'debriefing with good judgement' (Rudolph et al., 2006). Sub-section 2: e-Learning (Desmond O'Neill): Teachers in geriatric medicine can struggle to find space to teach necessary theory whilst ensuring that adequate consideration is given to complex clinical issues like ethics and communication (Gordon et al., 2010, Lane, 2000, Johnson, 2004, Ruiz et al., 2007). Computer assisted learning (CAL) packages provide an effective way of teaching fact-heavy topics (Eng, 2005, Chao et al., 2012, Hills et al., 2009), allowing face-to-face teaching to focus on more complex clinical issues, without increasing the total teacher contact time (Ruiz et al., 2007, Blundell et al., 2011). This sub-section will: • Focus on the current forms of e-learning in use - taken from examples in geriatrics educational literature - ranging from basic CAL packages to podcasts. • Explore the concept of blended learning, defined as “the combination of different learning environments in order to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skills” (Duque et al., 2013), and how this can overcome problems with e-learning such as learner isolation and lack of facilitation. • Discuss how to incorporate e-learning into syllabuses as part of a blended learning approach. Sub-section 3: Social media (Joanne Pattinson): Social media can provide a means for learners and teachers to connect and share ideas, experiences and resources. Twitter, for example, is an online social networking service accessible from any Internet-capable device, that since its inception in 2006, has gained over 200 million registered users (Kassens-Noor, 2012). This subsection will: • Discuss current social media platforms used in medical education. • Consider how teachers might incorporate social media into teaching, providing practical examples and teaching tips. Exemplar geriatric medicine social media resources and users will be signposted. • Discuss and debate the potential pitfalls associated with social media in this context will be highlighted, with reference to published guidance from professional statutory bodies across the EU. Conclusion: A criticism levied against innovative teaching is that it is simply “change for change's sake”. This is a temptation to be avoided. We must always innovate for a reason. By harnessing the best of available technologies and by mapping these to identified challenges in teaching about geriatric medicine, we can help to move care for our patients forward. We have provided practical examples within this symposium. There are considerable opportunities for cross-national learning on these issues. Pan- European forums to share lessons between educators in geriatric medicine should be further encouraged. Symposium Learning Outcomes: 1. Identify the types of e-learning available and how they can be utilised in a geriatric medical education setting. 2. Recognise the advantages that a blended learning approach may have both in terms of facilitating learning of complex topics whilst also freeing up teacher time. 3. Appreciate how simulation-based learning can be incorporated into the delivery of geriatric medicine teaching on a multitude of clinical topics and to a variety of professional groups. 4. Recognise that the debriefing process is a critical component to learning derived from simulation and recall a logical framework for a structured debrief. 5. Identify the current social media platforms whose use is gaining momentum in the field of medical education. 6. Appraise the added value, and the potential pitfalls, of the application of social media in geriatric medical education.

%X Background: Educating physicians and other health care professionals about the identification and treatment of patients who drink more than recommended limits is an ongoing challenge. Methods: An educational randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the ability of a standalone training simulation to improve the clinical skills of health care professionals in alcohol screening and intervention. The "virtual reality simulation" combined video, voice recognition, and nonbranching logic to create an interactive environment that allowed trainees to encounter complex social cues and realistic interpersonal exchanges. The simulation included 707 questions and statements and 1207 simulated patient responses. Results: A sample of 102 health care professionals (10 physicians; 30 physician assistants or nurse practitioners; 36 medical students; 26 pharmacy, physican assistant, or nurse practitioner students) were randomly assigned to a no training group (n = 51) or a computer-based virtual reality intervention (n = 51). Professionals in both groups had similar pretest standardized patient alcohol screening skill scores: 53.2 (experimental) vs 54.4 (controls), 52.2 vs 53.7 alcohol brief intervention skills, and 42.9 vs 43.5 alcohol referral skills. After repeated practice with the simulation there were significant increases in the scores of the experimental group at 6 months after randomization compared with the control group for the screening (67.7 vs 58.1; P < .001) and brief intervention (58.3 vs 51.6; P < .04) scenarios. Conclusions: The technology tested in this trial is the first virtual reality simulation to demonstrate an increase in the alcohol screening and brief intervention skills of health care professionals.

%X Background. With the rapid aging of the U.S. population, the proportion of elderly adults far exceeds the capacity of geriatric trained physicians for medical care. As a result of this critical shortage, health professionals without formal training in geriatrics mostly provide medical care for the elderly.We developed and implemented an interprofessional geriatrics education (IPGE) program for non- geriatric trained clinical health professionals, to foster enhanced knowledge and skills in geriatric care, as well as techniques for teaching. Methods. As an initiative of the Virginia Geriatric Education Center, a consortium of health-related departments in 3 universities, 10 health professionals from 4 disciplines (community physicians, nursing, physical therapy and occupational therapy) were enrolled in a 40 - hour comprehensive, longitudinal, geriatrics education program using both on line and in class format, with a focus on falls, geriatric syndromes, transitions in geriatric care and geriatric pharmacotherapy. The online platform offered opportunities for shared resources and participant feedback. Participants had exit interview surveys. Results. Participants evaluated the core content of the program as useful and relevant to their daily practice. One hundred percent of participants stated that both the online and in class content met their educational needs, and an average 85% of participants stated that they intend to make a practice change as a result of the program. Additionally, the participants rated the effectiveness of the teaching sessions, the faculty and the use of audio-visuals to be above average. The Interprofessional learning environment was favorably received. Online access and time availability were sited as possible barriers to learning. Conclusion. Health professionals from 4 disciplines, without formal geriatric training were able to enhance their knowledge of clinical geriatric care. In addition, these professionals are able to implement changes in their clinical practice and teach other health care professionals in their respective communities to improve care. IPGE can be a useful tool in improving geriatric care and provides a meaningful way to train different professionals at the same time, to address the shortage in geriatrics. More research is warranted to assess the full impact of IPGE programs.

%X Background and Aims: Nurses play a pivotal role in all phases of stroke patients care. However, despite the 2013 ESO recommendations and Stroke Unit certification criteria calling for Nurse training on acute stroke care, it is not included in most stroke care agendas of the ESOEAST countries. Method: In December 2015,the ESO launched the Stroke Unit Nurse Educational Project (SUNEP) within the ESO-EAST project. Englishspeaking representatives from ESO-EAST countries, appointed by national stroke/neurological societies, were invited to a kick-off meeting followed by an e-learning and an on-site training on a certified Stroke Unit. Results: Overall, 15 Nurses and five Physicians representing 12 ESOEAST countries were selected to participate in the SUNEP project. At the 3-day kick-off meeting held in March, the 20 participants were instructed on the project and its web-based platform. Six months later, 19 participants had successfully completed the “Special Care on Stroke Units” training modules (set up under the auspices of the German Stroke Society) and visited the certified Stroke Unit at Johannes Wesling Klinikum in Minden, Germany. All costs were covered by an unrestricted grant provided by Boehringer Ingelheim. To share the experience, the participants will be responsible for organizing educational activities, giving presentations at national and local conferences, and providing hands-on trainings in 2017 to 2019. Conclusion: The ESO-EAST SUNEP, the first comprehensive Nurse training on acute stroke care in the ESO-EAST countries, fully recognized the role Nurses play in all phases of stroke care. This project is scheduled to be scaled up within both the ESO-EAST and ANGELS initiatives.

%X Background: HIV risk reduction counseling (RRC) is an essential component of HIV vaccine trial conduct; strategies to sustain high quality counseling at trial sites are needed. We sought to evaluate the impact of a novel training and support program for site RRC mentors to enhance local RRC quality assurance efforts. Methods: In November 2008, the HVTN implemented an RRC mentor training program for NIAID-sponsored sites and those contracted by Merck, Inc. to conduct the Step trial. Thirty-eight sites designated RRC mentors to participate in a multi-faceted program including an RRC protocol/worksheet, Training of Mentors workshop, monthly webinar/call series, training at HVTN Conferences, personalized and small group consultations with an RRC training expert, an online clearinghouse of RRC resources, and a newsletter. In June 2010, an anonymous internet survey was administered to 203 counseling staff from participating sites as follow-up to a baseline needs assessment survey. Mentor involvement in the HVTN-organized program, types of site-level mentoring activities, and staff perceptions of change in RRC skills were assessed. Results: The overall response rate was 60% (n = 121). Approximately half (47%) of respondents were clinicians (physician/ nurse). Ongoing RRC mentoring programs were reported by 91% (30/33) of currently active sites; virtually all mentors (97%) participated in the HVTN-organized program. At sites, mentors most frequently facilitated individual or group discussions about challenging counseling issues, provided targeted technical support, and addressed counselor fatigue. Mentors cited time constraints and scheduling problems with staff as the most common barriers to mentoring. A substantial majority (79%) of RRC staff indicated their counseling skills improved over time due to on- site mentoring/training activities with 75% directly attributing an increase in skills to the HVTN program. Conclusion: Survey respondents reinforced that a centralized, multi-faceted training program to support local RRC mentors can facilitate RRC quality assurance efforts at global vaccine trial sites.

%X Background: The Public Health Agency of Canada's (the Agency) Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections (the Guidelines) are a key resource for Canadian clinical and public health professionals. More innovative and efficient means of dissemination of such resources are needed, and clinicians increasingly look to electronic tools to update their clinical knowledge and inform practice. In 2013, guided by needs-assessments and baseline research, the Agency embarked on the multi-phase development of a mobile application for the Guidelines, in order to facilitate use and improve uptake by practitioners in clinical and other settings where they may need to reference material on a mobile device. Methods: A multi-disciplinary team assembled in August 2013 to manage the development of the mobile application. The process included a research phase (healthcare practitioner needs-assessments and environmental scans of health information technology, including the CDC STD mobile application); a planning and analysis phase; wireframe testing; an application development phase; and prototype testing by healthcare practitioners. Results: The bilingual (English and French), multi-platform (iOS 6+, Android 2.2+, Windows 7+, and Blackberry 7+) mobile application is scheduled for launch July 2014. The native software is being written in HTML 5 and will allow for offline clinical use. Guidelines content on diagnosis, treatment, risk assessment and counselling will be streamlined and adapted for the mobile environment. The mobile application will be focus-tested twice by Agency physicians and nurses during the development process. A prototype will be available for demonstration at the conference. Conclusions: Mobile applications can be used to disseminate up-to-date, evidence- informed guidelines and other resources to clinical and public health professionals. The multi-phase development process for health-related information technology requires a variety of skill sets, including technical expertise, as well as the participation and engagement of healthcare practitioners. Performance and uptake of the tool will be evaluated after the launch.

%X Nursing interventions that target motivation to adopt healthy behaviors, such as motivational interviewing (MI), can help reduce cardiovascular risk factors. While face-to-face MI training lacks accessibility, e-Learning use for MI training is promising because of the flexibility it offers. The main objective was to develop an e-Learning training in brief MI (MOTIV@Coeur) and assess its feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effect on cardiovascular nurses' perceived skills in MI and frequency of delivering brief MI. A single group prepost pilot study was conducted to evaluate MOTIV@Coeur with nurses working in a coronary care unit. MOTIV@Coeur consists of two 30 minutes sessions based on videos of nursepatient interactions. A theoretical introduction of MI is followed by clinical situations in which a nurse practitioner evaluates patients' motivation to change, and intervenes according to the principles of brief MI. The clinical situations target smoking, medication adherence, physical activity and diet. Nurses completed both training sessions online within 20 days (± 5 days). Data collection occurred at 30 days (± 5 days) following the first session. We enrolled 31 nurses (27 women and 4 men, mean age 37 ± 9) in march 2016. Feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effect of MOTIV@Coeur will be presented with descriptive statistics. The change in perceived skills and frequency of use of MI prepost intervention will be compared by a t-test for paired samples. This study will inform the design of e-Learning training programs aimed at developing clinical skills of health professionals towards the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors.

%X Preliminary results of an experiment in the area of pharmacology. Background: The B-learning improves academic performance [1]. Blended learning is very popular and well received among students [2]. Students can learn through taking the role of a teacher [3]. Methods: The experience was performed in the subject of 'Pharmacology, Nutrition and Dietetics' of the second year of the Nursing Degree during the 2009-2010 academic years at the University of Alicante (Spain). A total of 180 students enrolled were invited to perform self-assessment tests (J-click and hot potatoes) into a Moodle platform. The activities and test questions were proposed by students themselves. The role of teachers has been limited to monitor the consistency of the questions asked, respecting the characteristic form of expression and the students' vocabulary. Results: The interim results show strong trends in favour of this procedure. These findings indicate that students who participated by providing questions and solving quizzes obtain better academic performance than those who were limited to answering the tests and these, in turn, stand on that have prevented their participation in the test. Conclusions: The approach of self-assessment exercises collaboratively by students, under supervision of faculty, is shown as a useful tool and could be useful in the transition to new teaching strategies suggested by the European Higher Education Area [1].

%X In different nursing programmes, one important learning outcome is clinical reasoning (CR) skills. However, to date, there is limited number of methods available for assessment of CR skills; especially for distance-based courses. This study investigates students' opinions about the feasibility of using Virtual Patients (VPs) for assessing CR in nursing education. VPs were introduced as an assessment tool in three different nursing courses at two universities, comprising 77 students in total. Students' overall acceptance of this assessment tool, including its applicability to the practise of nursing and the potential of VP-based assessment as a learning experience, were investigated using questionnaires. Course directors used the Web-SP system to assess students' interactions with VPs and their answers regarding diagnoses, caring procedures and their justifications. Students' found the VP cases to be realistic and engaging, and indicate a high level of acceptance for this assessment method. In addition, the students' indicated that VPs were good for practising their clinical skills, although some would prefer that the VP system be less "medical" and asked for more focus on nursing. Although most students supplied correct diagnoses and made adequate clinical decisions, there was a wide range in their ability to explain their clinical reasoning processes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X In health-care education, it is important to assess the competencies that are essential for the professional role. To develop clinical reasoning skills is crucial for nursing practice and therefore an important learning outcome in nursing education programmes. Virtual patients (VPs) are interactive computer simulations of real-life clinical scenarios and have been suggested for use not only for learning, but also for assessment of clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to investigate how experienced paediatric nurses reason regarding complex VP cases and how they make clinical decisions. The study was also aimed to give information about possible issues that should be assessed in clinical reasoning exams for post-graduate students in diploma specialist paediatric nursing education. The information from this study is believed to be of high value when developing scoring and grading models for a VP-based examination for the specialist diploma in paediatric nursing education. Using the think-aloud method, data were collected from 30 RNs working in Swedish paediatric departments, and child or school health-care centres. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The results indicate that experienced nurses try to consolidate their hypotheses by seeing a pattern and judging the value of signs, symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory tests and radiology. They show high specific competence but earlier experience of similar cases was also of importance for the decision making. The nurses thought it was an innovative assessment focusing on clinical reasoning and clinical decision making. They thought it was an enjoyable way to be assessed and that all three main issues could be assessed using VPs. In conclusion, VPs seem to be a possible model for assessing the clinical reasoning process and clinical decision making, but how to score and grade such exams needs further research.

%X For Virtual Patient-based exams, several scoring and grading methods have been proposed, but none have yet been validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new scoring and grading model for VP-based exams in postgraduate paediatric nurse education. The same student group of 19 students performed a VP-based exam in three consecutive courses. When using the scoring and grading assessment model, which contains a deduction system for unnecessary or unwanted actions, a progression was found in the three courses: 53% of the students passed the first exam, 63% the second and 84% passed the final exam. The most common reason for deduction of points was due to students asking too many interview questions or ordering too many laboratory tests. The results showed that the new scoring model made it possible to judge the students' clinical reasoning process as well as their progress.

%X Background: As part of a system-wide collaborative change process, a comprehensive education needs assessment was conducted with 15 acute and rehabilitation stroke teams within the Toronto Stroke Networks (TSNs). Evidence-informed educational and knowledge translation (KT) approaches were planned to bridge identified gaps for successful implementation of stroke best practices and excellence in patient care. Purpose: The purpose of this collaborative KT process is to enable successful learning and sustained adoption of best practices for improved patient care. Methods: The Education and KT plan was launched in collaboration with local organization stroke champions to integrate feedback and stimulate engagement. Health care providers (HCPs) were oriented to the newly launched online platform, the TSNs Virtual Community of Practice (VCoP), for access to resources, ongoing knowledge exchange, and cross-system collaboration from both clinical and interprofessional perspectives. Co-creation of stroke core foundational posters facilitated team and individual competencies for select best practices and provided HCPs with an enhanced networking opportunity building virtual competence for online collaboration. Completed best practice posters and introduction of a small group learning guide and peer mentorship initiative will be launched to facilitate a team approach and enable practice change. A scheduled interprofessional event will reinforce online networking. Results: Formative evaluation of the online format has led to improved utility of the VCoP. Member checking with stroke champions has resulted in an adapted communication process with regular prompting to enable progress. Development of a strategic approach for increasing front line nurse participation was also highlighted. Further evaluation will be available at time of publishing. Conclusions: This innovative approach to enhance patient care has shown promise as an effective collaborative process. Iterative member checking with opportunity to adapt locally is key for successful system wide change.

%X Aims: A recent Care Quality Commission report highlighted deficiencies in care for vulnerable older people. Those with diabetes are particularly at risk because of the lack of knowledge and training amongst carers, a problem acknowledged both in the UK and globally. To identify the cause of the problem, the Institute of Diabetes for Older People (IDOP) explored the concerns of healthcare professionals of all grades, working in care homes and in the domiciliary sector. Methods: We recruited participants through the quality monitoring team of NHS Northamptonshire. A session was devoted to each of the following professional groups: managers/senior nurses, healthcare assistants and carers from local nursing and residential homes and from domiciliary care. Using a focus group format, 13 questionsbased on the 2010 Diabetes UK document Good clinical practice guidelines for care home residents with diabeteswere discussed by each group. Comments were documented as bullet points on flip charts, confirmed formally by the group. Results: The main concerns identified were as follows: poor communication with hospital, primary care and mental health services;lack of training among staff in diabetes and dementia; training needs were not met by available e-learning modules; inadequate support provided by the local diabetes specialist team. Conclusions: The Northampton focus groups have identified several issues of national importance. These are paralleled in the national audit of diabetes care in care homes carried out by IDOP and the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists on behalf of a national stakeholder group.

%X Use of robotics is expanding rapidly in the medical arena. Not only are a growing number of facilities purchasing robotic systems, but the number of surgeons using them also is increasing, which creates many challenges (eg, cost, training, safety). The evolution of robotics in surgery is presented within the context of virtual reality, telepresence, telemanipulation, and passive (ie, master-slave) robotic surgical systems. A new perioperative nursing role, the robotics nurse specialist, was developed and implemented at one facility. The need for a robotics nurse specialist and how this role can help the entire surgical team promote positive patient and facility outcomes also is discussed.

%X Nurses work across the healthcare system in many ways - interacting with patients in acute and community care, as well as working in public health, health administration and as researchers. Nurses' wide range of involvement with clients and caregivers across the care continuum means they frequently interact with traditional and emerging technologies in healthcare. Healthcare 2.0 technologies offer platforms with entirely new potential that previous technology, time and geography prevented. Therefore, it is critical for nurses to learn the appropriate skills to leverage the expanding possibilities and mitigate risks created by digital tools and social media. New technology enables new possibilities and can have unintended consequences. As new uses for technologies are explored within healthcare, equal consideration must be made for the potential harm. Nurses must be aware of both the benefits and risk when engaging with digital tools. New opportunities must be balanced with clients' preferences and their right to access and control their information. As health professionals navigate these challenges, lessons have emerged which need to be shared. When risk is considered and mitigated, nurses can explore and experiment with new technologies to advance healthcare and the health of patients. Understanding both perspectives will enable nurses to develop new ways to support collaboration, expand research, enhance knowledge translation, and accelerate quality improvement in healthcare. Healthcare 2.0 can surface previously hidden work and connect groups with shared interests. A selection of examples will be used to illustrate ways healthcare providers are working to advance healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. The objectives of this presentation are to highlight the opportunities of healthcare 2.0, explore the risks, and suggest ways to plan and measure online initiatives. Case studies and examples will be used to illustrate the nurses' experience with technology.

%X Social networking use has increased exponentially in the past few years. A literature review related to social networking and nursing revealed a research gap between nursing practice and education. Although there was information available on the appropriate use of social networking sites, there was limited research on the use of social networking policies within nursing education. The purpose of this study was to identify current use of social media by faculty and students and a need for policies within nursing education at one institution. A survey was developed and administered to nursing students (n = 273) and nursing faculty (n = 33). Inferential statistics included χ2, Fisher exact test, t test, and General Linear Model. Cronbach's α was used to assess internal consistency of social media scales. The χ2 result indicates that there were associations with the group and several social media items. t Test results indicate significant differences between student and faculty for average of policies are good (P = .0127), policies and discipline (P = .0315), and policy at the study school (P = .0013). General Linear Model analyses revealed significant differences for "friend" a patient with a bond, unprofessional posts, policy, and nursing with class level. Results showed that students and faculty supported the development of a social networking policy.

%X Background: Continuity of care is integral to the quality of care provided to people with cancer and their carer(s). The need to address fragmented cancer care has been addressed in part by the development of the Nurse Cancer Care Coordinator (NCCC) roles. It is imperative to provide evidence of the contribution these roles make in improving the continuity of cancer care. Aim: The aim of the project was to clarify the theory underpinning the role of NCCCs and provide a tool for ongoing evaluation of these roles. This included theory underpinning how the role works including activities performed; resources required; expected outcomes; within a given context. Methods: The project was a qualitative study comprising of a literature review and exploring the views of experts (semi-structured interviews/email questionnaire), to develop a program logic. The participants were purposely selected to represent a range of perspectives including policy-makers, practitioners, patient advocates, and researchers. Results: The diversity of NCCC roles and theory was reflected in both the literature and practice. NCCC roles and activities were identified at the individual, organisational and systems level. Discussion: A range of theories were discussed that may inform the conceptualisation of NCCC roles including Complex Adaptive Systems, Boundary Spanning Theory and Relational Coordination; and the implication for roles focusing at different levels of the system were explored. Conclusion: The increasing complexity and demand for better coordinated care highlights the need to further research how NCCCs contribute to improving equity, safety, quality and coordination of care. The project has implications for research policy and practice, and makes explicit existing the theory (based on both the literature and in practice) to provide a platform for further evaluation for development of these roles.

%X Continuity of care is integral to the quality and safety of care provided to people with cancer and their carers. Further evidence is required to examine the contribution Nurse Cancer Care Coordinator (NCCC) roles make in improving the continuity. The aim of the present study was to clarify the assumptions underpinning the NCCC roles and provide a basis for ongoing evaluation. The project comprised a literature review and a qualitative study to develop program logic. The participants who were purposively sampled included policy makers, practitioners, patient advocates, and researchers. Both the literature and participant reports found that NCCC roles are diverse and responsive to contextual influences to coordinate care at the individual (patient), organisational, and systems levels. The application of the program logic for the development of NCCC roles was explored. The conceptualisation of NCCC roles was also examined in relation to Boundary Spanning and Relational Coordination theory. Further research is required to examine how NCCCs contribute to improving equity, safety, quality and coordination of care. The project has implications for research, policy and practice, and makes explicit existing assumptions to provide a platform for further development and evaluation of these roles.

%X Background: One of the greatest benefits of Apheresis Platelet Concentrates (APCs) is a less antigenic exposure to blood donors. Therefore, it is highly important in patients with needs of repeated platelet transfusions, as haematologic malignancies, in order to prevent refractory to random-donor platelets. The University Hospital of São João in Porto has a large hematologic department, with a high level of need for APCs. To face this demand, the Blood Bank of the University Hospital of São João, implemented an apheresis platelet program in July 2010. In 2013 a total of 700 APCs were collected, applying a strict quality control of the products. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of the quality control (QC) testing performed in 2013 to the apheresis platelets components. Methods: The apheresis platelet program includes a multidisciplinary working team formed by doctors and nurses and 2 AMICUS® Cell Separator Platforms. All the APCs are leukodepleted. Both the frequency of testing and the number of APCs tested in the QC were done according to the Europe Council and the Portuguese laws. The parameters evaluated were: volume, platelet and leukocytes count and pH at the end of shelf life.(Table present) Results: The units tested meet the criteria defined by the Portuguese law and Europe Council recommendations. Only two units showed a number of leukocytes count >1× 106 (3.8 × 106 and 5.4× 106),which were discharged. Summary/Conclusions: The blood components, namely the APCs, produced by the AMICUS® Cell Separator Platform, fully meet the criteria defined by the Europe Council and the Portuguese laws. It should also be noted that the quality of these blood products reflects not only the method itself, but the entire apheresis program, including an adequate donor selection and a rigorous collection and storage procedures of the component, performed by a highly motivated team.

%X Introduction: Interprofessional collaboration among health care professionals yields improved patient outcomes, yet many students in health care programs have limited exposure to interprofessional collaboration in the classroom and in clinical and service-learning experiences. This practice gap implies that students enter their professions without valuing interprofessional collaboration and the impact it has on promoting positive patient outcomes. Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the interprofessional experiences of students in health care professional programs as they collaborated to provide health care to Guatemalan citizens over a 7-day period. Methods: In light of the identified practice gap and a commitment by college administration to fund interprofessional initiatives, faculty educators from nursing, occupational therapy, and physical therapy conducted a qualitative study to explore a service-learning initiative focused on promoting interprofessional collaboration. Students collaborated in triads (one student from each of the three disciplines) to provide supervised health care to underserved Guatemalan men, women, children, and infants across a variety of community and health care settings. Eighteen students participated in a qualitative research project by describing their experience of interprofessional collaboration in a service-learning environment. Twice before arriving in Guatemala, and on three occasions during the trip, participants reflected on their experiences and provided narrative responses to open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis methodology was used to describe their experiences of interprofessional collaboration. Results: An interprofessional service-learning experience positively affected students' learning, their growth in interprofessional collaboration, and their understanding and appreciation of health care professions besides their own. The experience also generated feelings of gratitude for the opportunity to be a member of an interprofessional team and to serve those in need by giving of themselves. Conclusion: The findings support service learning as a platform to encourage interprofessional collaboration among students in health care professional programs. The research will inform future service-learning experiences in which interdisciplinary collaboration is an outcome of interest. © 2013 Fries et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

%X Background and aims Pain management is often inadequate in emergency departments (ED) despite the availability of effective analgesics. Interventions to change professional behavior may therefore help to improve the management of pain within the ED. We hypothesized that a 2-h educational intervention combining e-learning and simulation would result in improved pain treatment of ED patients with pain. Methods Data were collected at the ED of Horsens Regional Hospital during a 3-week study period in March 2015. Pain intensity (NRS, 0–10) and analgesic administration were recorded 24 h a day for all patients who were admitted to the ED during the first and third study weeks. Fifty-three ED nurses and 14 ED residents participated in the educational intervention, which took place in the second study week. Results In total, 247 of 796 patients had pain >3 on the NRS at the admission to the ED and were included in the data analysis. The theoretical knowledge of pain management among nurses and residents increased as assessed by a multiple choice test performed before and after the educational intervention (P = 0.001), but no change in clinical practice could be observed: The administration for analgesics [OR: 1.79 (0.97–3.33)] and for opioids [2.02 (0.79–5.18)] were similar before and after the educational intervention, as was the rate of clinically meaningful pain reduction (NRS >2) during the ED stay [OR: 0.81 (CI 0.45–1.44)]. Conclusions Conduction of a 2-h educational intervention combining interactive case-based e-learning with simulation-based training in an ED setting was feasible with a high participation rate of nurses and residents. Their knowledge of pain management increased after completion of the program, but transfer of the new knowledge into clinical practice could not be found. Future research should explore the effects of repeated education of healthcare providers on pain management. Implications It is essential for nurses and residents in emergency departments to have the basic theoretical and practical skills to treat acute pain properly. A modern approach including e-learning and simulation lead to increased knowledge of acute pain management. Further studies are needed to show how this increased knowledge is transferred into clinical practice.

%X Use of Web 2.0 and social media technologies has become a new area of research among health professionals. Much of this work has focused on the use of technologies for health self-management and the ways technologies support communication between care providers and consumers. This paper addresses a new use of technology in providing a platform for health professionals to support professional development, increase knowledge utilization, and promote formal/informal professional communication. Specifically, we report on factors necessary to attract and sustain health professionals' use of a network designed to increase nurses' interest in and use of health services research and to support knowledge utilization activities in British Columbia, Canada. "InspireNet", a virtual professional network for health professionals, is a living laboratory permitting documentation of when and how professionals take up Web 2.0 and social media. Ongoing evaluation documents our experiences in establishing, operating, and evaluating this network. Overall evaluation methods included (1) tracking website use, (2) conducting two member surveys, and (3) soliciting member feedback through focus groups and interviews with those who participated in electronic communities of practice (eCoPs) and other stakeholders. These data have been used to learn about the types of support that seem relevant to network growth. Network growth exceeded all expectations. Members engaged with varying aspects of the network's virtual technologies, such as teams of professionals sharing a common interest, research teams conducting their work, and instructional webinars open to network members. Members used wikis, blogs, and discussion groups to support professional work, as well as a members' database with contact information and areas of interest. The database is accessed approximately 10 times per day. InspireNet public blog posts are accessed roughly 500 times each. At the time of writing, 21 research teams conduct their work virtually using the InspireNet platform; 10 topic-based Action Teams meet to address issues of mutual concern. Nursing and other health professionals, even those who rated themselves as computer literate, required significant mentoring and support in their efforts to adopt their practice to a virtual environment. There was a steep learning curve for professionals to learn to work in a virtual environment and to benefit from the available technologies. Virtual professional networks can be positioned to make a significant contribution to ongoing professional practice and to creating environments supportive of information sharing, mentoring, and learning across geographical boundaries. Nonetheless, creation of a Web 2.0 and social media platform is not sufficient, in and of itself, to attract or sustain a vibrant community of professionals interested in improving their practice. Essential support includes instruction in the use of Web-based activities and time management, a biweekly e-Newsletter, regular communication from leaders, and an annual face-to-face conference.

%X Research Objectives: To assess rehabilitation infrastructure in Peru in terms of WHO Health System Building Blocks. Design: Anonymous quantitative survey. Questions were based on WHO Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care and rehabilitation professionals' input. Setting: Nine large public hospitals and referral centers in Lima and an online survey platform. Participants: Convenience sample of hospital personnel working in rehabilitation and neurology, recruited through existing contacts and professional societies. Interventions: N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): This is a descriptive study and thus does not emphasize main planned outcomes. Results: Regarding 'Health Workforce,' 47% of PTs, 50% of OTs, and 22% of physiatrists never see inpatients. Few reported rehabilitative nurses (15%) or prosthetist/orthotists (14%) at their hospitals. Even at large hospitals, most reported three or fewer OTs (55%) and SLPs (72%). At hospitals without SLPs, PTs (49%) or nobody (34%) performs SLP roles. At hospitals without OTs, PTs most commonly (59%) perform OT tasks. Alternate prosthetist/orthotist task performers are OTs (26%), PTs (19%), and physicians (16%). Forty-four percent reported interdisciplinary collaboration. Regarding 'Health Services,' the most frequent inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation barriers were referral delays (50%) and distance/ transportation (39%), respectively. Regarding 'Health Information Systems,' 28% reported rehabilitation service data collection. Regarding 'Essential Medical Products and Technologies,' electrophysical agents (88%), gyms (81%), and electromyography (76%) were most common; thickened liquids (19%), swallow studies (24%), and cognitive training tools (28%) were least frequent. Conclusions: Outpatient rehabilitation services seem strong, and there are relatively adequate numbers of PTs and physiatrists. Financial barriers seem low for accessing existing services. There appear to be shortages of inpatient rehabilitation, specialized services, and interdisciplinary collaboration. These may be addressed by redistributing hospital personnel and investing in education and equipment for specialized services. Further examination of task sharing's role in Peru's rehabilitation services is necessary to evaluate its potential to address deficiencies.

%X Introduction Simulation has been increasingly utilised in medical education since the publication of Safer Medical Practice.1 Some specialities have led the way in integrating simulation training into curricula to cover technical and higher-level nontechnical skills training. To date simulation in gastroenterology has largely restricted itself to the use of virtual reality endoscopy training. Even then, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate how best to integrate this into the curriculum, so this remains untackled.2 In 2015 UCLPartners funded a Gastroenterology Simulation Fellow, based at The Homerton Hospital, to consider how best to use simulation to deliver multi-professional training across UCLP Trusts. Among the aims has been optimising trainee preparation for learning endoscopy; improving interprofessional training; addressing a need for higher-level skills training; creating sustainability in delivering training; and engaging trainees in reflective practice that is little utilised as a tool elsewhere in training. Methods Over the course of a year we are delivering 15 oneday courses from 4 UCLParters trusts. They include courses in Screen-based Endoscopy Technical Skills, Human-Factors in Virtual Endoscopy and Situational Training in Gastroenterology. The courses are open to both gastroenterology and endoscopy nurses and gastroenterology and surgical registrars, matching different courses to different training grades. We are evaluating the courses by means of written feedback using both Likert Scales and freetext. We will analyse both quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate how well received the courses were; how well they addressed specific demands of the curriculum and revalidation requirements; and whether they successfully addressed elements of the curriculum not met elsewhere. We are also undertaking faculty feedback to ascertain explore the perception of increasing simulation training in gastroenterology and identify any barriers to the ongoing delivery of training. Results Early results from the first courses seem to indicate that they were well received with high levels of enjoyment and engagement, and that there may be significant gaps in the training programme which may best be met by simulation. By early June we will have undertaken collation of all data from course feedback, and analysis as above. Conclusion The results will inform the integration of simulation into the training program and local curriculum over the coming years and how to create sustainability to achieve this.

%X BACKGROUND:: Americans are increasingly using social media (such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter) for health-related communication. Much of the previous research on social media and health communication has focused on Facebook groups related to a specific disease or Facebook pages related to an advocacy organization. Less is known about how people communicate about cancer on personal Facebook pages. OBJECTIVE:: In this study, we expand upon previous research by examining how cancer caregivers use personal Facebook pages for cancer-related communication. METHODS:: We examined themes in cancer-related exchanges through a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publically available Facebook pages hosted by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (15 852 total posts). RESULTS:: Six themes emerged: (1) documenting the cancer journey, (2) sharing emotional strain associated with caregiving, (3) promoting awareness and advocacy about pediatric cancer, (4) fundraising, (5) mobilizing support, and (6) expressing gratitude for support. CONCLUSIONS:: Building upon previous research documenting the increasing use of social media for health-related communication and support, our findings show that personal Facebook pages offer a platform for cancer caregivers to share their cancer-related experiences, promote advocacy and awareness, and mobilize social support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Providers must recognize the importance of social media as a vehicle for support and communication for families of children with cancer. Nurses should educate parents on how to appraise information obtained through Facebook using evidence-based guidelines. Providers can encourage caregivers to use Facebook as a tool for communication, information, and support.

%X BACKGROUND: The recent convergence between technology and medicine is offering innovative methods and tools for behavioral health care. Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones). METHODS: The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations-teachers and nurses-that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation. RESULTS: Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs. CG=0.5%) in chronic "trait" anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.

%X Maintaining confidence in vaccine safety is critical to successful public health immunization programs. Surveillance and assessment of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) are important for maintaining vaccine safety. The authors describe the evaluation of an initiative at Fraser Health Authority designed to enhance the role of a communicable disease nurse coordinator (CDNC) in assessing AEFI reports, in collaboration with a designated medical health officer (MHO) as required, and providing recommendations to clients and immunization providers. Previously, only MHOs performed this role. This evaluation project demonstrates this initiative's feasibility and provides a roadmap for health authorities interested in pursuing a similar model. MHOs, public health nurses and public health management expressed satisfaction with the process and the quality of the CDNC's recommendations. There was no statistically significant difference in median turnaround time for AEFI reporting date and date of recommendation, indicating this work is completed in as timely a manner by the CDNC as by the MHO. This role provides opportunity for professional growth, facilitates nursing practice to full scope, enables acquisition of specialized knowledge and provides a platform to share nursing expertise at a provincial level.

%X AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using crisis resource management (CRM) principles and high-fidelity human patient simulation (HFHPS) for interprofessional (IP) team training of students from undergraduate nursing, nurse anesthesia, medical, and respiratory therapy. BACKGROUND: IP education using simulation-based training has the potential to transform education by improving teamwork and communication and breaking down silos in education. METHOD: This one-year study used a quasi-experimental design to evaluate students' acquisition and retention of teamwork and communication skills. A convenience sample consisted of 52 students in the fall semester, with 40 students returning in the spring. RESULTS: Mean scores increased after training, and skills were retained fairly well. Any loss was regained with repeat training in the spring. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that using CRM and HFHPS is an effective pedagogy for teaching communication and teamwork skills to IP student teams.

%X Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition which contributes to poor prognosis(1). Providing prompt and effective nutritional care to cancer patients is important to improve their quality of life and increase survival. However, cancer patients report that they receive little support on nutrition management from health care professionals (HCP)(2). During a needs assessment in Ayrshire & Arran, staff expressed a need to improve knowledge and skills about nutritional care of cancer patients(3). NHS Ayrshire & Arran and Macmillan have developed and launched an e-learning programme “Nutritional care of people affected by cancer”(4). We conducted an external evaluation of the programme using qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the programme effectiveness by measuring participants' knowledge, attitudes, and confidence in nutritional care in cancer. Focus groups and structured telephone interviews with NHS staff in Ayrshire aided questionnaire development. The final questionnaires were linked to the online programme(4) and tested knowledge using case studies, assessed practice, attitudes and confidence, and evaluated the content, delivery and impact of the programme. Data was collected at baseline, after module completion (data not shown) and at 6 months follow-up. After 11 months, a total of 1125 participants had enrolled and 118 users (10%) had completed the entire programme. Baseline questionnaires were completed by 31% (n = 338) of those enrolled and 6 months follow-up questionnaires by 21% (n = 31) of those who completed the course (19% response rate). Most participants were dieticians (25% at baseline and 40% at follow-up) and nurses (17% at baseline and 27% at follow-up). At baseline>80% dieticians provided tailored nutritional plans, nutrition advice, food supplements and recommended to patients “to eat what they can” while>70% nurses referred to a dietician and provided diet advice. Screening for malnutrition was common amongst dieticians and nurses but not other HCP. Baseline nutritional knowledge was very good but only 22% of participants had correct knowledge about screening for malnutrition using a screening tool like MUST(5). Participants felt nutrition was important for cancer treatment and most (59% to 74%) felt confident in their knowledge about weight loss, nutritional screening, supplement feeds/sip feeds, treatment of side effects using non pharmacological agents, health literacy and effective provision of information. Participants, however, were not confident about knowledge on malnutrition treatment (44%), alternative/fad diets (67%) and advice on adequate sources of internet based information (50%). Attitudes towards provision of information were mostly positive. At 6 months follow-up, 88% agreed that the course fulfilled their expectations. The total course rating was good (mode 5, 1-7 scale). The majority of participants rated the course organisation/structure (stories, navigation, external links, assessment) as good whereas the content was rated as very good/excellent. Nearly half the participants said they had changed their practice such as they now refer to support groups and less were advising patients “to eat what they can” or providing standard nutrition information leaflets. An increase in confidence about their knowledge on complementary and therapeutic diets (58%) and on fad diets (55%) was reported. However, knowledge about nutritional screening was not retained by most participants. Overall the education programme has been well received but completion rates are low. The course helped participants to re-enforce knowledge, attitudes and confidence but long term knowledge in areas such as nutritional screening needs further attention.

%X Background: The Trauma Pod (TP) vision is to develop a rapidly deployable robotic system to perform critical acute stabilization and/or surgical procedures, autonomously or in a teleoperative mode, on wounded soldiers in the battlefield who might otherwise die before treatment in a combat hospital could be provided. Methods: In the first phase of a project pursuing this vision, a robotic TP system was developed and its capability demonstrated by performing selected surgical procedures on a patient phantom. Results: The system demonstrates the feasibility of performing acute stabilization procedures with the patient being the only human in the surgical cell. The teleoperated surgical robot is supported by autonomous robotic arms and subsystems that carry out scrub-nurse and circulating-nurse functions. Tool change and supply delivery are performed automatically and at least as fast as performed manually by nurses. Tracking and counting of the supplies is performed automatically. The TP system also includes a tomographic X-ray facility for patient diagnosis and two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic data to support interventions. The vast amount of clinical protocols generated in the TP system are recorded automatically. Conclusions: Automation and teleoperation capabilities form the basis for a more comprehensive acute diagnostic and management platform that will provide life-saving care in environments where surgical personnel are not present.

%X We provide a brief review and appraisal of recent and current virtual reality (VR) technology for Alzheimer's disease (AD) applications. We categorize them according to their intended purpose (e.g. diagnosis, patient cognitive training, caregivers' education, etc.), focus feature (e.g. spatial impairment, memory deficit, etc.), methodology employed (e.g. tasks, games, etc), immersion level, and passive or active interaction. Critical assessment indicates that most of them do not yet take full advantage of virtual environments with high levels of immersion and interaction. Many still rely on conventional 2D graphic displays to create non-immersive or semi-immersive VR scenarios. Important improvements are needed to make VR a better and more versatile assessment and training tool for AD. The use of the latest display technologies available, such as emerging head-mounted displays and 3D smart TV technologies, together with realistic multi-sensorial interaction devices, and neuro-physiological feedback capacity, are some of the most beneficial improvements this minireview suggests. Additionally, it would be desirable that such VR applications for AD be easily and affordably transferable to in-Home and nursing home environments.

%X We report a feasibility study of patient self-testing telemedicine for anticoagulant management using TOPCARE (Telematic Homecare Platform in Cooperative Health Care Provider Networks, developed by the European Commission for a user-friendly information society). TOPCARE comprises a Home Telematic Box (TOPCARE BOX), a central database held on a remote server and secure computer terminals in the anticoagulant clinic. The TOPCARE BOX transmits encrypted International Normalized Ratio (INR) results from the CoaguChek S monitor (Roche Diagnostics) via the patient's telephone line to the database, which is accessed by health-care professionals via the Internet. The database displays the patient's anticoagulant record, highlighting out of range results, overdue tests and quality control results. The database can also send information back to the TOPCARE box, although currently only the next test date can be transmitted. 23 patients, on long-term oral anticoagulation were recruited from the hospital anticoagulant clinic. After completing a nurse-led training course, patients tested their INR weekly on a CoaguChek S and transmitted their results via the TOPCARE BOX. The nurse specialist accessed the patient's results, electronically entered the date of the next test. Changes in warfarin dose were telephoned. Four patients dropped out early in the study and 19 patients received TOPCARE BOXs of which nine were fully functional. Unintentional software misconfiguration meant that remaining 10 TOPCARE BOXs were nonfunctional (these were later reconfigured but not reintroduced into the study). Patients successfully transmitted 222 results over a 5-month period using the TOPCARE system. Early server problems were resolved, but intermittent problems with database access persisted and five results were not received by the server. Although concerns were raised regarding technical problems, feedback from patients and staff was favourable and the system thought to be user-friendly. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that telemedicine is a feasible option for anticoagulant management, but that the technology requires thorough testing prior to installation. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Background Nurses are vital in the care and treatment of children/adults with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies (SID). For patients on long-lasting/life-long treatments, such as e g IgG replacement therapy, the nurses are often the ones who support self-care of the patients/families, take the practical decisions about the IgG therapy and the necessary equipment, and take responsibility for therapy follow-ups. The PID/SID University Education Project The education will be at advanced level, evidence-based and comprise 7.5 credit points (nursing science 4.5 medical science 3.0 points). A web based teaching and learning platform will be used, thus making it possible for nurses living/working far away from the University to participate. The medical education will cover e g pathophysiology including genetics, symptoms and diagnostic procedures, microbiology and treatment of infections; nursing education will cover e g research-based knowledge about immunodeficiency treatments, motivational dialogue techniques, patient-/family-education including compliance, and quality of life. The education will be held for the first time during spring semester 2015. Future education and graduation This is a unique University education for nurses in Swedish/ Scandinavian speaking countries. Still, the education should be considered a first stepping-stone in creating a formal graduation as an Immunology/PID Nurse. The opportunity for further courses deepening the knowledge in different areas will hopefully be possible within the European Union Higher Educational System, and possibly globally, involving INGID as the coordinating organisation.

%X Introduction: COPD mortality secondary to respiratory failure in the UK is double the European average (NHS England, 20151). Following this report, the BTS recommend the need to improve emergency oxygen (O ) administration and respiratory failure management. This management need was highlighted by the findings of our hospital O2 Audit where only 33% of patients received formally prescribed oxygen. Aim and Methods: To establish the extent of staff knowledge of O prescribing in respiratory failure, a cross-sectional survey of 100 healthcare professionals within our acute Trust was undertaken. Results: Healthcare staff (Nursing - 36%, medical - 50%, allied professions - 14%) completed a questionnaire survey. 49% reported receiving no respiratory failure training and 46% lacked education on O therapy. 92% considered O to be a drug, however 49% failed to identify a venturi valve as a controlled O device with 40% not knowing how or when to use it. ABGs showing Type I Respiratory Failure were correctly interpreted by 75% of participants, however only 38% recognised Type II Respiratory Failure with compensation. Participants: (80%) recognised the need for education though not via e-Learning provision. Study days, ward based learning or a combination were the preferred option (43%). Conclusion: Education is essential to improve O management and the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory failure. A trust-wide staff education programme to improve patient management and safety has now been developed and will be audited post implementation.

%X BACKGROUND: Little has been written about using human patient simulation to teach primary care management to large groups of nurse practitioner (NP) students. This article describes an innovative design for simulated clinical experiences based on a game show format. METHOD: This large-group design was conceived as a way to overcome several challenges, particularly limited faculty resources, to integrating simulation into NP education. Progressive variations evolved from this foundation, including the use of observer-participant groups; initial and follow-up visits on the same simulated patient; and mentor-mentee collaborations. RESULTS: Student comments, while consistently positive about the simulated clinical experiences, have been used to guide revisions to strengthen the simulation program. CONCLUSION: The innovative large-group design enabled faculty to use simulation to enhance students' skills in primary care management. Faculties with similar challenges might find these strategies useful to replicate or adapt.

%X This article explores a case of the implementation of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in an undergraduate preregistration nursing program in a Canadian school of nursing. A small practice collaborative project to develop reusable simulation resources for team-based simulations is described, using HFS technology. Considerations for effective learning resulting from faculty and student evaluations of the project are discussed. Students identified positive learning experiences and indicated that real-time patient status changes proved valuable to them. Also, using these techniques offered a safe environment for improving competence. The use of reflective debriefing appeared to be a focal area for learning that requires emphasis in the planning of HFS experiences. This template, team-focused learning approach also appeared to offer a cost-efficient strategy for HFS.

%X Background: Call volumes reported by most US poison centers (PC) have been decreasing for 5 years or longer, despite increased population. Historically, more than half of PC calls have concerned children-5 years of age. The reason for this decrease in PC calls remains unknown. Objective: To establish whether call volume changes differ by age groups and types of call, during the period 2000-2010. Methods: Call volumes to one large PC and to one large pediatric nurse advice center (PNAC) were analyzed by age of patient, site of call, and type of call. The PC served the entire state. The PNAC, operated as a free service during 2003-2008 by the children's health care system with-95% regional market share of pediatric inpatient and ED care, served the state's largest metropolitan area (47% of state population). PC data from 2000-2010 was utilized; PNAC data was only available for 2003-2008. US Census Bureau annual population estimates for the state by age group were used. Results: During years 2000-2005, estimated child population-5 yr (CL5) increased 16% while call volume about CL5 from homes to the PC was level and from healthcare increased 11%. PNAC CL5 volume decreased 6% from 2003 to 2005. During 2005-2010, CL5 population decreased 0.5% while CL5 calls to the PC from homes decreased 11.3%, and from healthcare increased 12.5%. PNAC CL5 calls decreased an additional 13% from 2005-2008. During years 2000-2005, estimated adult population-65 yr (AG65) increased 10% while calls about AG65 increased 37%. During 2005-2010, AG65 population increased 19% while calls about AG65 increased 6.5%. Discussion : The trend of decreased PC volume is predominantly driven by calls from homes about children-5 years old. The same decrease in call volume from lay callers has affected the area's largest PNAC as well. Call volume about older adults (Table presented) increased as did population. This trend may reflect a change in information seeking practices by young adults as compared to older adults. Most of the parents of the children-5 years are younger adults who have been raised during an era of technological change and ascendancy of the internet and social media, and who have been shown to be more likely to have internet access. Given that the trends observed span across different types of health call centers, the etiology is not specifi c to PCs and the need for their services. Further study is needed about these trends.

%X Adverse drug events are common in the intensive care unit setting. Despite the existence of many long-standing safety principles (such as the "five rights") and new mechanisms to promote medication safety, there is still a gap between practice and the goal of patient safety. This is the result of the many human and system factors that impact care delivery. Research supports the role of the nurse as having a positive impact on patient outcomes. Future research requires the evaluation of new strategies and technologies to support safe medication administration. For example, patient simulation is being used to teach student and novice nurses principles of medication administration in a "safe" setting that more closely resembles the clinical environment. The Institute of Nursing repeatedly has stressed the need to address the organizational, technical, and human issues that impact patient safety, with an emphasis on the need to transform the nurse work environment to keep patients safe. This transformation will require a new level of interdisciplinary research and nursing involvement to address better care for our patients and, in particular, reduce adverse drug events.

%X Background Care homes identified within Telford and Wrekin PCT with high ambulance and A&E attendances - a high number due to falls. Aim - to detect those with AF reducing the number of falls (a known cause). • Incentive introduced - highly qualified district nurse i.e. case manager visited both homes during week to monitor/observe residents, detect early signs/symptoms of illness commencing treatment if required or referring to GP • Training programme provided to care workers - aim to reduce ambulance call outs, reduce hospital admissions, empower care home staff, develop more proactive approach to management of illness. • Train the trainer package, e learning package developed Methodology A Cross-sectional study involving observation of 18 care home population at one specific point in time was conducted with the aim - to provide data on entire population under the study, also a descriptive study (neither longitudinal nor experimental) describing: the absolute risks/relative risks from prevalence of AF some feature of the population i.e. prevalence of AF to support inferences of cause and effect Result • Development of basic skills to detect irregular pulse across all levels of staff working within care home • Low cost training materials, e learning package being developed with BOOTS Chemis • Prevention of stroke from undetected A • Improved patient experien • Reduced hospital patient admission • Reduced calls to ambulance service • Empowered workforce able to take on proactive management of the prevention of diseas Number of irregular pulses detected along with those who went on to receive clinical / pharmaceutical intervention Engagement of care home staff and managers has been sought to enable this project to take place. Engagement of GPs is continuing to ensure they understand the importance of following up the calls from care homes Conclusion Patient groups within care homes are the very elderly within our society, their needs are not always identified. This project puts them at the forefront of the campaign to ensure all those with AF are detected, managed appropriately and a STROKE prevented.

%X Background & Hypothesis: Online e-learning such as continuing medical education (CME) and continuing professional development (CPD) has been used widely as a mode to train healthcare workforce and to enhance patient care. This study is a bibliographic analysis of literature on this topic. Methods: A systematic review is underway to synthesise evidence on online e-learning for healthcare professionals (HCPs). Medline (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane (Wiley), Psychinfo (Ovid), ERIC (Ovid), Cinahl (Ebsco) and Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters) were searched for studies on online eLearning for postregistration professionals from 1990 to 2015. Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cluster RCTs were included. Results: Of the 2668 articles included for full text screening, 252 fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 55% of these articles were published in the last 5 years, and the number of articles has increased by 278% from 2004-2014. The years 2012 (n = 43) and 2013 (n = 35) had the highest numbers of articles. The 252 included articles were published in 172 journals, of which 43 journals published 2 or more articles. The majority of these studies were conducted among doctors (52%) and nurses (26%) and were published in the surgical (8%), paediatric (8%), emergency medicine (5%) and nursing journals (5%). Among the doctors, 58% physicians, 17% surgeons, 15% paediatrics, 5% each from obstetrics and gynaecology and psychiatry. Discussion & Conclusion: There is a substantial body of evidence on use of online e-learning for training postregistration professionals, specifically doctors. However, its effectiveness and quality of evidence is yet to be ascertained.

%X Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of whole arm chromosome probes is a robust technique for mapping genomic regions of interest, detecting chromosomal rearrangements, and studying three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes in the cell nucleus. The advent of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and whole genome amplification (WGA) allows obtaining large quantities of DNA from single cells. The increased sensitivity of WGA kits prompted us to develop chromosome paints and to use them for exploring chromosome organization and evolution in non-model organisms. Here, we present a simple method for isolating and amplifying the euchromatic segments of single polytene chromosome arms from ovarian nurse cells of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. This procedure provides an efficient platform for obtaining chromosome paints, while reducing the overall risk of introducing foreign DNA to the sample. The use of WGA allows for several rounds of re-amplification, resulting in high quantities of DNA that can be utilized for multiple experiments, including 2D and 3D FISH. We demonstrated that the developed chromosome paints can be successfully used to establish the correspondence between euchromatic portions of polytene and mitotic chromosome arms in An. gambiae. Overall, the union of LCM and single-chromosome WGA provides an efficient tool for creating significant amounts of target DNA for future cytogenetic and genomic studies.

%X The National Quality Forum (NQF) Safe Practices are a group of 34 evidence-based Safe Practices that should be universally used to reduce the risk of harm to patients. Four of these practices specifically address leadership. A recently published book, 7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis, offers practical advice on how to lead in crisis. An analysis of how concepts from the 7 lessons could be applied to the Safe Practices was presented nationally by webinar to assess the audience's reaction to the information. The objective of this article was to present the information and the audience's reaction to it. Recommendations for direct actions that health care leaders can take to accelerate adoption of NQF Safe Practices were presented to health care leaders, followed by an immediate direct survey that used Reichheld's "Net Promoter Score" to assess whether the concepts presented were considered applicable and valuable to the audience. In a separate presentation, the challenges and crises facing nursing leaders were addressed by nursing leaders. Six hundred seventy-four hospitals, with an average of 4.5 participants per hospital, participated in the webinar. A total of 272 safety leaders responded to a survey immediately after the webinar. A Net Promoter Score assessment revealed that 58% of those surveyed rated the value of the information at 10, and 91% scored the value of the webinar to be between 8 and 10, where 10 is considered a strong recommendation that those voting would recommend this program to others. The overwhelmingly high score indicated that the principles presented were important and valuable to this national audience of health care leadership. The 2010 environment of uncertainty and shrinking financial resources poses significant risk to patients and new challenges for leaders at all levels. A values-grounded focus on personal accountability for leading in crisis situations strongly resonates with those interested in or leading patient safety initiatives.

%X Background: More than 7.5 million children younger than age five living in low- and middle-income countries die every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity and to improve quality of care by improving the delivery of a variety of curative and preventive medical and behavioral interventions at health facilities, at home, and in the community. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of programs that implement the IMCI strategy in terms of death, nutritional status, quality of care, coverage with IMCI deliverables, and satisfaction of beneficiaries. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE, Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EbscoHost; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Virtual Health Library (VHL); the WHO Library & Information Networks for Knowledge Database (WHOLIS); the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science; Population Information Online (POPLINE); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); and the Global Health, Ovid and Health Management, ProQuest database. We performed searches until 30 June 2015 and supplemented these by searching revised bibliographies and by contacting experts to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. Selection criteria: We sought to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-after (CBA) studies with at least two intervention and two control sites evaluating the generic IMCI strategy or its adaptation in children younger than age five, and including at minimum efforts to improve health care worker skills for case management. We excluded studies in which IMCI was accompanied by other interventions including conditional cash transfers, food supplementation, and employment. The comparison group received usual health services without provision of IMCI. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened searches, selected trials, and extracted, analysed and tabulated data. We used inverse variance for cluster trials and an intracluster co-efficient of 0.01 when adjustment had not been made in the primary study. We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results: Two cluster-randomised trials (India and Bangladesh) and two controlled before-after studies (Tanzania and India) met our inclusion criteria. Strategies included training of health care staff, management strengthening of health care systems (all four studies), and home visiting (two studies). The two studies from India included care packages targeting the neonatal period. One trial in Bangladesh estimated that child mortality may be 13% lower with IMCI, but the confidence interval (CI) included no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.10; 5090 participants; low-certainty evidence). One CBA study in Tanzania gave almost identical estimates (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.05; 1932 participants). One trial in India examined infant and neonatal mortality by implementing the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illness (IMNCI) strategy including post-natal home visits. Neonatal and infant mortality may be lower in the IMNCI group compared with the control group (infant mortality hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.94; neonatal mortality HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; one trial, 60,480 participants; low-certainty evidence). We estimated the effect of IMCI on any mortality measured by combining infant and child mortality in the one IMCI and the one IMNCI trial. Mortality may be reduced by IMCI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93; two trials, 65,570 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials (India, Bangladesh) evaluat d utritional status and noted that there may be little or no effect on stunting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06; 5242 participants, two trials; low-certainty evidence) and there is probably little or no effect on wasting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; two trials, 4288 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The Tanzania CBA study showed similar results. Investigators measured quality of care by observing prescribing for common illnesses at health facilities (727 observations, two studies; very low-certainty evidence) and by observing prescribing by lay health care workers (1051 observations, three studies; very low-certainty evidence). We could not confirm a consistent effect on prescribing at health facilities or by lay health care workers, as certainty of the evidence was very low. For coverage of IMCI deliverables, we examined vaccine and vitamin A coverage, appropriate care seeking, and exclusive breast feeding. Two trials (India, Bangladesh) estimated vaccine coverage for measles and reported that there is probably little or no effect on measles vaccine coverage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; two trials, 4895 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with similar effects seen in the Tanzania CBA study. Two studies measured the third dose of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine; and two measured vitamin A coverage, all providing little or no evidence of increased coverage with IMCI. Four studies (2 from India, and 1 each from Tanzania and Bangladesh) reported appropriate care seeking and derived information from careful questioning of mothers about recent illness. Some studies on effects of IMCI may report better care seeking behavior, but others do not report this. All four studies recorded maternal responses on exclusive breast feeding. They provided mixed results and very low-certainty evidence. Therefore, we do not know whether IMCI impacts exclusive breast feeding. No studies reported on the satisfaction of mothers and service users. Authors' conclusions: The mix of interventions examined in research studies evaluating the IMCI strategy varies, and some studies include specific inputs to improve neonatal health. Most studies were conducted in South Asia. Implementing the integrated management of childhood illness strategy may reduce child mortality, and packages that include interventions for the neonatal period may reduce infant mortality. IMCI may have little or no effect on nutritional status and probably has little or no effect on vaccine coverage. Maternal care seeking behavior may be more appropriate with IMCI, but study results have been mixed, providing evidence of very low certainty about whether IMCI has effects on adherence to exclusive breast feeding.

%X Virtual reality (VR) has been demonstrated as an effective tool to help people overcome a variety of anxiety disorders. In this case study, the use of VR as a distractor to alleviate pain and anxiety associated with an invasive medical procedure for a pediatric cancer patient was explored. An A-B-C-A design during four consecutive medical appointments in an outpatient oncology clinic compared no distraction (A), non-VR distraction on a computer screen (B), and VR distraction with a head set (C). Behavioral observations of distress by the researcher and reports of pain and anxiety by the patient, parent, and nurse were taken before and during the procedure. The child's pulse was monitored throughout the procedure. The findings from this case study suggest benefit from using VR distraction, as indicated by lower pain and anxiety ratings, reduced pulse, and fewer observed behavioral indices of distress. The need for larger scale studies and application of VR with younger children is discussed in the context of confirming effectiveness of this technique and providing more generalizable information about efficacy.

%X Objective: To pilot and test the feasibility of a novel technology to reduce anxiety and pain associated with an invasive medical procedure in children with cancer. Method: Children with cancer (ages 7-19) whose treatment protocols required access of their subcutaneous venous port device (port access) were randomly assigned to a virtual reality distraction intervention, a non-virtual reality distraction, or treatment as usual without a distraction. The researchers obtained assessments of the child's pain and anxiety from the parent, child, and unblinded nurses. Pulse rate was monitored throughout the procedure, and behavioral indices of distress were recorded, as observed by the researchers. Results: Reductions in pain and anxiety were found for children who used the virtual reality distraction in comparison with the no distraction condition as evidenced by lower pulse rate and reports of pain by nurses. No significant differences were found for the non-virtual reality condition versus the no distraction condition on pulse rate. Conclusions: These findings suggest that virtual reality may be a useful tool for distraction during painful medical procedures, but further studies are needed to test potential efficacy and feasibility during other, more distressing medical procedures with larger sample sizes.

%X Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common and fastest growing genetic disorder in the UK. NICE guidance highlights the importance of training in effective pain management and recognition of secondary complications that occur in this setting. Simulation can lead to substantial learning gains that can transfer to actual patient care, however high fidelity patient simulation (HPS) which aims to provide a strong physical resemblance to a real life situation is expensive to implement in terms of resources and time and is not widely available. Preliminary investigations in our department suggest that recreating the physical reality of a scenario may be less important than the narrative (semantic) and emotional reality. A high degree of scripting in the scenario and protocolised debrief were also found to be of value. In this study we have investigated the use of low fidelity simulation to train haematology ST3 grade on emergency sickle protocols at induction to their SpR training programme. A group of senior haematology clinicians selected three scenarios of increasing difficulty based on an acute painful sickle crisis, acute chest syndrome and biliary sepsis. The cases were based on real-life scenarios where exemplary management would improve patient outcome. Cases were piloted in a HPS facility to confirm a high degree of semantic reality. Anonymised real data from these cases included blood tests, observation charts, and blood gas meaurements. A protocolised debrief was designed based on hospital protocols /National guidelines/ recommendations of national clinical care reports. The minimum number of portable props were used including 1. Oxygen mask 2. Syringes marked with doses of opiates and naloxone 3. A doll 4. Drug charts 5. Fluid balance charts 6. observation charts 7. Results of blood tests 8. CXR 9. A mobile phone 10. Fluid bags (see fig 1.). Two investigators were involved: one acting as the voice of the doll and the other acting as a nurse whose role included giving results of investigations that were requested. Effectiveness of teaching was evaluated with a questionnaire. Nine trainees attended and all responded to the evaluation. Baseline experience was variable: all had managed acute painful crises before (median number 20, range 2-50) but experience with acute chest syndrome and abdominal complications was zero for the majority. The semantic reality of the scenarios was confirmed as high. 7/9 felt the scenarios recreated the emotional reality of managing a sickle crisis: professional interactions with the nurse, a sense of time pressure and availability of equipment such as charts and results played a part in this. The physical reality was not considered high with the seminar room environment and unrealistic doll contributing to this. Nonetheless despite the lack of physical reality and considerable baseline experience in managing acute painful crises, all participants considered the teaching to be useful (2)/very useful (7) and pitched at the right level (9/9). 8/9 felt that it was a safe environment to make mistakes. 8/9 felt more confident as a result of the teaching. The most frequent theme in free-text comments was gratitude. Low fidelity simulation for haematology emergency protocol training represents a feasible and effective teaching strategy with low costs. Its strengths rest on using relevant teaching cases pitched at the right level with a high degree of semantic reality.

%X This article presents the design and evaluation of an interprofessional multiple-patient simulation between nursing and graduate dietetic students. Dietetic students' completed surveys were observed, scored, and debriefed during 3 patient simulations, and submitted plans of care. Fifteen of the 16 students agreed that the simulation enhanced interprofessional communication skills. Plans of care improved after debriefings, and 37 of the 39 nursing students who completed the simulation with dietetic students said the experience helped them learn the dietitian's role. Interprofessional simulations provide a practice opportunity for students to deliver clinical care in a safe setting. Debriefing is formative in improving nutrition care process skill.

%X The need for reform in nursing education has been clearly defined. The difficulty has been in finding ways to facilitate the process.This article describes an innovative web-based virtual community. The Neighborhood, used to promote conceptual learning across a new curriculum at the University of New Mexico College of Nursing. The Neighborhood features 30 fictional characters that represent various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and demonstrate a range of health and psychosocial problems. These characters interact with various community agencies in numerous health care settings. The Neighborhood has strong links to three well-founded teaching strategies: storytelling, case-based learning, and interpretive pedagogy. Because the cases unfold over time, in much the same way problems develop in real life, ongoing exposure to a concept is permitted, facilitating deep understanding.

%X Purpose: Cultural competence is an expectation of professional practice, yet effectively teaching this concept to nursing students is challenging. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of a virtual community as a teaching application to foster cultural awareness among nursing students. Method: This correlational study involved the collection of two surveys from 342 first-semester students from five baccalaureate nursing programs that used The Neighborhood virtual community during one semester. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Findings and Conclusions: Results suggest that use of the virtual community may have contributed to cultural awareness among student participants. There was a significant correlation between frequency of use and cultural awareness. Virtual communities may represent a useful teaching application for cultural competence in nursing education. Further research is needed to specifically test cultural competence education strategies using a virtual community platform. © The Author(s) 2012.

%X Background/Case Studies: For a BC, effecting change in a Transfusion Service can be a challenge. An MDAto PBM was developed. Study Design/ Methods: The tactic was to divide the MDA into 8 sections. Section 1: The Transfusion Safety Officer (TSO) Workshop 2-day course covered transfusion safety. Faculty was composed of six physicians board-certified in Transfusion Medicine and the hospital TSO. A senior-level medical technologist served as program director. Continuing education was available for medical technologists, nurses, and physicians. The workshops were offered in several cities. Participants were provided evaluations for speakers and the overall program. Section 2: Resource binders were created for each TSO participant and included slide sets, bibliographies, PBM newsletters, scientific papers, regulatory guidelines, TSO job descriptions, and other items of interest. The binders were to be used as a platform to build a PBM library. Section 3: The TSO Users Group (UG) served to maintain momentum after the workshop. It was available to all participants and was held as a webinar every 2 mo. The agenda consisted of a brief survey, which included pertinent issues raised by the participants and which allowed for the sharing of interesting cases and best practices. Section 4: Benchmarking data were obtained and compiled from surveys with results provided at the UG meetings. Section 5:. The PBM newsletter was published quarterly. It was edited and reviewed by the BC physicians' group. Once the topic was selected, the newsletter presented a literature search and summary, offered best practices, and closed with a bibliography. Section 6: White papers were written by the BC physician team; they addressed in-depth pertinent and sometimes controversial transfusion topics, such as CMV-negative vs. leukoreduced products. Section 7: Regional PBM Teams were created, consisting of a physician, a medical technologist, and a nurse. These teams were designed to be deployed quickly and efficiently to area hospitals in response to a variety of PBM requests. Section 8: the PBM web portal is on the BC's password-protected Scientific, Medical and Technical website; itwas created to serve as a library for surveys, TSO UG meeting minutes, presentations, and articles of interest. Results/Findings: From 12/01/12 to 03/31/14, the following was accomplished (Table). The PBM newsletters addressed transfusion thresholds for major components, alternatives to allogeneic transfusion, PBM in surgery, and the needs of Jehovah's Witness patients. TSO workshops and UG evaluations had favorable outcomes. Conclusion: Implementation of MDA to PBM as a value-added (no charge) service allowed for significant hospital participation and was well-received by the end-users. Resources were made available to initiate and maintain a hospital-based PBM program. (Table Presented).

Simulation-based medical education (SBME) focuses on obtaining clinical skills in psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains and is superior to the traditional style of education with improved outcomes of knowledge, skills and behaviors and demonstrable effects for patient-related outcomes. A stroke simulation study at our center showed significant improvements in the cognitive and affective domain of new residents and this next phase aims at incorporating members of the multidisciplinary stroke team. Hypothesis: SBME improves stroke emergency performance, particularly for inexperienced stroke team members. Methods: Eight neuro ICU nurses participated in a high fidelity patient simulation of an in-hospital ischemic stroke eligible for IV tPA. The nurse independently managed every nursing task including a focused patient assessment, verifying and evaluating vitals and treating appropriately, expediting labs, managing common obstacles and coordinating care with the stroke team. Nurses completed an affective survey, pre- and post-test cognitive assessment and debriefing with feedback. An evaluator completed a real-time checklist of pre-defined tasks and the subject participated in a review of their performance with the stroke team. Results: Subjects showed a 19.4% improvement in the cognitive assessment post-simulation (p=0.02). The affective survey showed nurses were confident in their ability to perform the NIHSS. While there was no significant change in the affective domain post simulation due to the subject groups being too small for statistical comparison, recognition of normal parameters (labs and vitals) for treatment of stroke showed an improvement of 6.25%. Conclusion: SBME can facilitate the acquisition of technical skills and non-technical skills such as team work, communication, decision-making and cognizance of personal limitations. This pilot demonstrated that nurses can benefit in the cognitive domain through simulation and feedback indicated that a stroke simulation with increased interaction among stroke team members, with defined roles would add to the fidelity of the simulation.

%X Objectives: High-fidelity patient simulation provides lifelike medical scenarios with real-time stressors. Mass casualty drills must construct a realistic incident in which providers care for multiple injured patients while simultaneously coping with numerous stressors designed to tax an institution's resources. This study compared the value of high-fidelity simulated patients with live actor-patients. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted during two mass casualty drills in December 2006 and March 2007. The providers' completion of critical actions was tested in live actor-patients and simulators. A posttest survey compared the participants' perception of "reality" between the simulators and live actor victims. Results: The victims (n = 130) of the mass casualty drill all had burn-, blast-, or inhalation-related injuries. The participants consisted of physicians, residents, medical students, clerks, and paramedics. The authors compared the team's execution of the 136 critical actions (17 critical actions x 8 scenarios) between the simulators and the live actor-patients. Only one critical action was missed in the simulator group and one in the live actor group, resulting in a miss rate of 0.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01% to 4.5%). All questionnaires were returned and analyzed. The vast majority of participants disagreed or strongly disagreed that the simulators were a distraction from the disaster drill. More than 96% agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend the simulator as a training tool. The mean survey scores for all participants demonstrated agreement that the simulators closely mimicked real-life scenarios, accurately represented disease states, and heightened the realism of patient assessment and treatment options during the drill with the exception of nurse participants, who agreed slightly less strongly. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that simulators compared to live actor-patients have equivalent results in prompting critical actions in mass casualty drills and increase the perceived reality of such exercises. © 2008 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

%X Nurse educators are challenged to keep up with highly specialised clinical practice, emerging research evidence, regulation requirements and rapidly changing information technology while teaching very large numbers of diverse students in a resource constrained environment. This complex setting provides the context for the CaseWorld project, which aims to simulate those aspects of clinical practice that can be represented by e-learning. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of CaseWorld, a simulated learning environment that supports case based learning. CaseWorld provides nursing students with the opportunity to view unfolding authentic cases presented in a rich multimedia context. The first round of comprehensive summative evaluation of CaseWorld is discussed in the context of earlier formative evaluation, reference group input and strategies for integration of CaseWorld with subject content. This discussion highlights the unique approach taken in this project that involved simultaneous prototype development and large scale implementation, thereby necessitating strong emphasis on staff development, uptake and engagement. The lessons learned provide an interesting basis for further discussion of broad content sharing across disciplines and universities, and the contribution that local innovations can make to global education advancement.

%X Objectives: To assess tolerance and willingness for patients to participate in leukapheresis studies for HIV immunology. Leukapheresis collection allows the harvest of large quantities of PBMCs to provide sufficient cells to perform complex immune assessments. Methods: Patient recruitment was done using oral information provided during scientific and community-based conferences and by word of mouth. A signed ethical consent was obtained from each participant. Serological and hematological analyses including HIV, CMV, HBV, HCV as well as CBC, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts were performed. The procedure consists of removing PBMCs from blood by a peripheral vein using Cobe Spectra equipment performed by a research nurse. Results : Since January 2010 to November 2013 a total of 295 leukapheresis procedures have been performed that include healthy donors (n=110, including 41 CMV+ donors), HCV infected (n=11) or HIV patients (n=174). HIV-infected patients included primo-infection (n=10), non-treated viremic (n=40), ART-treated (n=64), long-term non-progressors (n=23), and 37 patients receiving immunotherapy: autologous dendritic cells (n=24, ARGOS study) or IL-7 (n=13, Inspire II study). The procedure was well tolerated and no serious, immediate or delayed side effects were noticed. Participants were mostly men (n=247 [87%]) with a mean age of 46±12 years from Caucasian (n=222 [90%]) and African descents (n=25 [10%]). Patient's characteristics were anonymously registered in the McGill University Health Centre database. The total volume collected was 200 mL containing around 10×109 to 15×109 of WBCs and up to 150 mL of plasma during a three hour collection. Conclusions: The leukapheresis unit represents a unique way to collect large quantities of WBCs and has significantly contributed to important findings in clinical, immunological and virological aspects of HIV pathogenesis and immunotherapy.

Specifically, the results describe the tension and hostility which was predominating in clinical settings when the research was conducted. The reactions of both degree and non-degree nurses to the changes in nursing education are put forward. It is suggested by the author that while work environments have been characterised by destructive behaviours, nurses' verbalising their reactions to this situation, have provided a platform to deal more constructively with personal and professional change.

%X Introduction: Distress screening is advocated as standard practice in many guidelines. There is uncertainty regarding feasibility and acceptability of its implementation in routine practice. Objectives: To develop tailored pathways to integrate systematic distress screening in an oncology department and to evaluate feasibility and acceptability, referral practice and distress. Methods: The Distress Thermometer (DT) and its Problem List (PL) of the National Cancer Coalition Network (NCCN) was selected to implement distress screening in consecutive outpatients with newly diagnosed breast-, colon-and prostate-cancer. Pathways and roles of nurses as coordinators were outlined. A patient questionnaire and staff interviews were used for evaluation of satisfaction, acceptability and feasibility. Results: 102 patients were asked to participate, 85 (83%) returned the DT and 80 (94%) returned the satisfaction-questionnaire. The majority of patients were females (87%), mean age 61 years (sd 13, 32-95). Mean distress score was 4 (range 0-9); fatigue and anxiety were occurred most frequently (60% and 54%). Few patients wished referral to psycho-oncology or social services (3%), some (5%) already had psychological support in place before screening. Satisfaction with the procedure was rated high/very high by 97% of patients and 87% said that they could easily communicate their problems. Nurses judged their screening role feasible and satisfying. Conclusions: Implementation of nurse-coordinated distress screening appears to be an acceptable and feasible way to integrate systematic, psychosocial oncology care. However, referral rates to other services remain low. Screening provides a platform for communication about distress between patient and primary care team.

%X OBJECTIVE: Telehealth and telenursing are becoming the new reality in studying nursing. Little is known whether undergraduate nursing students receive adequate education on telenursing for patient care. The aim for this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of nursing students toward telenursing. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Students of nursing faculties from medical universities in Poland were invited to complete a survey about telehealth and telenursing. The survey was conducted utilizing a Web-based surveying platform ( www.mini-ankiety.pl ). RESULTS: We surveyed 308 undergraduate students of nursing faculty-291 females (94%) and 17 males (6%)-from medical universities in Poland. There were 116 students in their first year (course) (38%) and 96 students each in the second and third years (31%). Most of the students (220 [71%]) in the study group were in the age range from 20 to 23 years. The accurate definition of telemedicine was identified by 251 (82%) respondents. The definition of telenursing was recognized properly by 230 (75%) respondents. Of the students, 207 (67%) would anticipate telenursing service implementation into the national healthcare system, and 214 (69.49%) would appreciate the addition of telenursing classes to the curriculum. Students from a few universities showed significantly higher willingness to introduce telenursing classes into nursing curriculum and the intention to use telenursing services in their future nursing practice. The difference among universities could be influenced by regional e-health initiatives. This study has shown the rise of trust in technology along with the increase in the year of nursing study. CONCLUSIONS: The current generation of university students of nursing seems to be well educated in medical informatics and technology use. They are better prepared for and open to information society membership, including the practice of telehealth. The advancement in university education has an influence on positive attitudes toward telenursing and may become a milestone in the development of e-health in Poland.

%X In February, 2016, WHO released a report for the development of national action plans to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, the catastrophic consequences of inaction, and the need for antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship combined with infection prevention comprises a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to optimise use of antibiotics. Efforts to mitigate overuse will be unsustainable without learning and coordinating activities globally. In this Personal View, we provide examples of international collaborations to address optimal prescribing, focusing on five countries that have developed different approaches to antibiotic stewardship—the USA, South Africa, Colombia, Australia, and the UK. Although each country's approach differed, when nurtured, individual efforts can positively affect local and national antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Government advocacy, national guidelines, collaborative research, online training programmes, mentoring programmes, and social media in stewardship all played a role. Personal relationships and willingness to learn from each other's successes and failures continues to foster collaboration. We recommend that antibiotic stewardship models need to evolve from infection specialist-based teams to develop and use cadres of health-care professionals, including pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers, to meet the needs of the global population. We also recommend that all health-care providers who prescribe antibiotics take ownership and understand the societal burden of suboptimal antibiotic use, providing examples of how countries can learn, act globally, and share best antibiotic stewardship practices.

%X The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and suitability of virtual reality (VR) as a pain distraction for pediatric intravenous (IV) placement. Twenty children (12 boys, 8 girls) requiring IV placement for a magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scan were randomly assigned to two conditions: (1) VR distraction using Street Luge (5DT), presented via a head-mounted display, or (2) standard of care (topical anesthetic) with no distraction. Children, their parents, and nurses completed self-report questionnaires that assessed numerous health-related outcomes. Responses from the Faces Pain Scale-Revised indicated a fourfold increase in affective pain within the control condition; by contrast, no significant differences were detected within the VR condition. Significant associations between multiple measures of anticipatory anxiety, affective pain, IV pain intensity, and measures of past procedural pain provided support for the complex interplay of a multimodal assessment of pain perception. There was also a sufficient amount of evidence supporting the efficacy of Street Luge as a pediatric pain distraction tool during IV placement: an adequate level of presence, no simulator sickness, and significantly more child-, parent-, and nurse-reported satisfaction with pain management. VR pain distraction was positively endorsed by all reporters and is a promising tool for decreasing pain, and anxiety in children undergoing acute medical interventions. However, further research with larger sample sizes and other routine medical procedures is warranted. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X The use of high fidelity human simulation has exploded into the nursing education context over the last decade. In Ontario, Canada an innovative Critical Care e-learning program was established in 2007 to create accessible critical care education for nurses across Ontario and Canada. The program has a three-pronged approach including online, simulation and practicum components. The purpose of this paper is to present lessons learned during the last five years of development and growth of this program. The paper will focus on the use of simulation to build confidence and prepare registered nurses for critical care nursing practice. In addition, subsequent development of a network of ten simulation partners that deliver critical care simulation will be discussed. High fidelity simulation delivery in the critical care context will be explored and the use of summative or 'high stakes' simulation competency evaluation will be elaborated on. © 2012 Royal College of Nursing, Australia.

%X Background: Cancer experts engage in public communication whenever they promote their research or practice, respond to media inquiries, or use social media. In a changing communication landscape characterized by new technologies and heightened attention to cancer controversies, these activities may pose ethical challenges. This study was designed to evaluate existing resources to help clinicians navigate their public communication activities. Methods: We conducted a systematic, qualitative content analysis of codes of ethics, policy statements, and similar documents disseminated by professional medical and nursing societies for their members. We examined these documents for four types of content related to public communication: communication via traditional media; communication via social media; other communication to the public, policy, and legal spheres; and nonspecific language regarding public communication. Results: We identified 46 documents from 23 professional societies for analysis. Five societies had language about traditional news media communication, five had guidance about social media, 11 had guidance about other communication domains, and 15 societies offered general language about public communication. The limited existing guidance focused on ethical issues related to patients (such as privacy violations) or clinicians (such as accuracy and professional boundaries), with less attention to population or policy impact of communication. Conclusions: Cancer-related professional societies might consider establishing more specific guidance for clinicians concerning their communication activities in light of changes to the communication landscape. Additional research is warranted to understand the extent to which clinicians face ethical challenges in public communication. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

%X Background. The assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) is a Medical goal; it is used in clinical research, medical practice, health-related economic studies and in planning health management measures and strategies. The objective of this project is to develop an informational platform to achieve a patient self-assessment with standardized QoL measuring instruments, through friendly software, easy for the user to adapt, which should aid the study of QoL, by promoting the creation of databases and accelerating its statistical treatment and yet generating subsequent useful results in graphical format for the physician analyzes in an appointment immediately after the answers collection. Methods. First, a software platform was designed and developed in an action-research process with patients, physicians and nurses. The computerized patient self-assessment with standardized QoL measuring instruments was compared with traditional one, to verify if its use did not influence the patient's answers. For that, the Wilcoxon and t-Student tests were applied. After, we adopted and adapted the mathematic Rash model to make possible the use of QoL measure in the routine appointments. Results. The results show that the computerized patient self-assessment does not influence the patient's answers and can be used as a suitable tool in the routine appointment, because indicates problems which are more difficult to identify in a traditional appointment, improving thus the physician's decisions. Conclusions. The possibility of representing graphically useful results that physician needs to analyze in the appointment, immediately after the answer collection, in an useful time, makes this QoL assessment platform a diagnosis instrument ready to be used routinely in clinical practice. © 2012 Gonçalves and Rocha; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

%X ISSUE: Hand hygiene (HH) compliance direct observation requires observer training and validation. To improve care and prevention of infections in children with cancer worldwide, HH compliance is essential. Direct HH compliance observation is part of the World Health Organization (WHO) HH multimodal improvement strategy. In a situational analysis, we identified lack of training and validation of HH compliance observers at our international partner sites. PROJECT: We first developed and recorded a 10-week online Spanish course for viewing at our website. Second, we designed a database using the Epi Info TM7 to enter and analyze HHcompliance observation data. Then, we delivered the course using: (1) individualized online training (asynchronous distance learning method), and (2) on-site training by retrieving and Projecting the online course. We trained in HH theory and field practice. The theoretical component had four modules based on the WHO educational materials. The 6-week field practice consisted of 4 weeks of 20-minutes daily observations, and 2-weeks of data entry and analysis. RESULTS: Eighty healthcare workers (HCWs) from 47 healthcare facilities in 8 Latin American countries enrolled in the training course. Forty three participants completed both components. Thirty participants completed the theoretical component only and 7 withdrewfrom the course. Of the 80 HCWs, 84% (67) were nurses, most of them infection preventionists (n=41). Significant knowledge transfer was documented for both delivering Methods (Table1 & 2). Participants carried out 1260 direct HH monitoring sessions and reported more than 18,000 HH opportunities (Table 3). Fortythree participants successfully used the database. In 18 healthcare facilities, direct HH compliance monitoring was conducted for the first time. LESSON LEARNED: E-learning is a promising tool to train and validate direct HH compliance observers in low and middle income countries. An online educational platform, local leadership and ementoring are essential to implement this novel approach in this setting. (Table Presented).

%X Topic Significance & Study Purpose/Background/Rationale: The University of Virginia (UVA) has adopted the BE SAFE initiative with the commitment of providing a safe environment for patients and staff, the BE SAFE platform utilizes the A3 process improvement tool to standardize and optimize workflow to eliminate waste and unnecessary practices, thereby increasing quality, value, and safety. In support of the BE SAFE initiative we utilized A3 methodology to examine the fragmented chemotherapy stem cell mobilization process. Methods, Intervention, & Analysis: A multidisciplinary team was assembled including an A3 facilitator, pharmacist, physicians, transplant coordinators, and patient access personal. We used the A3 problem solving tool to review the current state, visually illustrating the process using Microsoft Visio, identify the root cause and analyze breaks in communication. Findings & Interpretation: Communication breaks included improperly scheduled patient appointments, incomplete documentation, limited time with patients to provide education, poor communication between departments as patients transitioned through the system, patient anxiety, as well as limited access to outpatient services. Discussion & Implications: A standardized process was implemented to ensure chemotherapy mobilization orders were signed in a timely manner. The schedule of patient education was initiated at initial evaluation and continued throughout mobilization. A tentative calendar with a flow diagram is provided and reviewed with patients and caregivers frequently. Pharmacists were integrated into the education plan to allow for more support for patients and caregivers regarding medication regimens. The Mobilization Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) found on the UVA intranet is now being used to provide education to staff including apheresis, infusion, and hematology-oncology inpatient nurses. Patient Access created a registration process for weekends and holidays. Ongoing 1:1 education will continue as needed as staff members and/or resources change. This project demonstrated that the use of a standardized problem solving format is useful for optimizing processes. In an effort to measure outcomes the plan is to implement a questionnaire pre and post mobilization which will include rating the following: education received, ease of process and understanding related to educational material and did these interventions increase your knowledge about stem cell transplant mobilization or was additional information needed.

%X Aim. The purpose of this study was to explore the development of critical thinking for students who received instruction using high-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) versus low-fidelity simulation (instructor-written case studies). Background. Simulated patient care environments have become increasingly more sophisticated in nursing labs, with HFPS fast becoming the standard for laboratory teaching/learning. Method. A convenience sample of first-semester associate degree nursing students participated in this quasi-experimental study. One group of students received weekly HFPS patient simulations and the other group received weekly case studies. Both groups took a pre- and posttest using the Health Studies Reasoning Test Results. Both groups showed an increase in critical thinking skills; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the HFPS and case study groups. Conclusion. Results suggest that high- and low-fidelity simulations are both associated with increases in critical thinking scores.

%X Aims: Following the introduction of competency-based training in 2007, the Paediatric Palliative Care Medicine curriculum was produced by the education subgroups of the RCPCH British Society for Paediatric Palliative Medicine and the Association of Children's Hospice Doctors. This document informs training and assessment of doctors who encounter paediatric end of life care or children with life-limiting/life threatening conditions. With the European working time directive and reduction in hours to 48 per week, there is less time for teaching. This abstract describes setting up an e-learning module in Paediatric Palliative care. Methods: An initial funding bid to National Health Service (NHS) West Midlands was successful with further funding for animation obtained from the Department of Health Paediatric palliative care monies. At an initial meeting of key regional Paediatricians and specialist nurses identified through the West Midlands Paediatric Palliative care network, module content was agreed using the Paediatric palliative care curriculum as guidance. By tender bids, a media company was selected who produced examples of e-learning modules and a script template. Over 18 months, scripts were written and consensus reached on fi nal content at a 1 day review meeting attended by 7 members of the initial group. The module has involved close liaison with ACT (Association for Children's Palliative Care). Results: 22 modules with over 60 animations and audio clips have been produced. A sample will be demonstrated. Interactive exercises are a key feature. The modules can be used in any order, healthcare professionals can select modules according to their own learning needs and they form part of a blended approach to learning. From April 2011, these modules can be accessed free of charge via the NHS West Midlands or ACT websites. Conclusions This e-learning resource for paediatric palliative care is an important and timely project to enhance training and education for high quality paediatric palliative care. E-learning is growing in importance due to reduced working hours and increasing technological capabilities. This resource, blueprinted to the palliative care curriculum, is applicable not only to regional Paediatricians but also nationally and internationally. Unlike a book, important amendments will be made without significant time delay.

%X The Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) are innovative approaches to strengthening the academic and clinical training of physicians and nurses in Sub-Saharan African countries, which are heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS. Begun in 2010 by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief with the National Institutes of Health, investments in curricula, innovative learning technologies, clinical mentoring, and research opportunities are providing a strong base to advance high-quality education for growing numbers of urgently needed new physicians and nurses in these countries. The MEPI and NEPI focus on strengthening learning institutions is central to the vision for expanding the pool of health professionals to meet the full range of a country's health needs. A robust network of exchange between education institutions and training facilities, both within and across countries, is transforming the quality of medical education and augmenting a platform for research opportunities for faculty and clinicians, which also serves as an incentive to retain professionals in the country. Excellence in patient care and a spirit of professionalism, core to MEPI and NEPI, provide a strong foundation for the planning and delivery of health services in participating countries.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Recent ACGME resident duty hour guidelines increased frequency of transfers in patient care thus imposing the need to create an efficient, safe and standardized hand-off process. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1. Improve Patient Safety - The clinical handover is one of five key areas identified under the World Health Organization Alliance for Patient Safety High 5 s Project. 2. Improve efficiency - Verbal handovers are associated with loss of all data, written handovers lose 31% of data, and a combination of written and verbal handover results in minimal loss of data. The medical model of handover stresses on standardization and a minimal dataset. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Ours is a 440- bed community based teaching hospital with resident teams following patients from admission to discharge. A cross-cover or night float team takes care of overnight events, with communication between the teams established via this electronic tool. Our focus was to create an electronic standardized handover tool that avoids redundancy and provides consistent, easy access to data while improving patient safety and decreasing errors during transitions of care. The goal was to transfer information on patient presentation, current status, and anticipatory guidance. This custom-built HIPAA-compliant online module was created within Microsoft SharePoint®. Built-in automation pulls patient demographics and allows for simultaneous viewing and editing capability by all care providers including physicians, nursing, and pharmacy staff. During the identification of handover fields to be included in the module, key areas common to different departments were identified. This led to the creation of a collaborative electronic handover to augment verbal transaction. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVEMETRICSWHICH WILL BE USEDTOEVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Adverse patient safety events were monitored as a measure of success with initial goal at implementation being to maintain patient safety at the same level as before implementation. User feedback was taken into consideration to assess the user friendly nature of this module and make updates. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE “FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED”): Allowing for a team-based approach streamlined care and provided a complete picture of the patient. The electronic clinical handover successfully identified unstable patients and clinical concerns, forwarded pending tasks, and provided anticipatory guidance. Furthermore, psychological and social needs could be addressed. Patient safety events did not show any deterioration after implementation and are being monitored to ensure further improvement. Feedback from users showed increasing familiarity with the module improved efficiency with less time being spent on preparing a hand off. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Our solution provides a standardized and a streamlined dataset, collaboration within the patient care team, and an electronic platform that is HIPAA-compliant. This defines and establishes a separation between the handover and the clinical content in electronic medical records. This provides a consistent handover process, yet affords flexibility for mobile solutions. Technology allows for advanced capabilities, such as instant messaging, web-based group meetings, and audio and video uploads, making this method truly distinctive. Our tool lays the foundation for a reliable patient-centric handover. This unique implementation of teambased approach is innovative in the realm of patient safety. Our copyrighted application will be expanded to other institutions within our network.

%X BACKGROUND: A government funded pilot project was finalized in the beginning of 2013. The aim was an integrated cancer rehabilitation, addressing, assessing and meeting the physical, psychological, social and existential needs of cancer patients and their significant others independent of cancer site and stage of the disease.The innovational process, which included the active participation of patients, significant others and medical staff, have delivered new services, resources routines and a plan for implementation and continuing development. METHOD: Within one hospital, with different processes for cancer care based on diagnosis, a project group with the mission to develop services, resources, routines and support to foster integrated cancer rehabilitation was created. Through the active use of social media channels and reference groups patients, significant others and medical staff could take an active role in the development.In the model physicians and nurses routinely address, assess and meet patients different needs of cancer rehabilitation through the whole cancer care process and a multi-professional cancer rehabilitation team supports the medical staff. The model was tested and evaluated in a small scale. RESULTS: After evaluation in reference groups, clinical practice and focus groups run by innovation science researchers the model was adjusted and, together with an implementation plan, presented to the Hallands Hospitals board of directors. Following the positive response the next step is to implement the model across the regions three hospitals. This should be conducted as an implementation study.The following has been developed: • A multi-professional cancer rehabilitation team • Routines for addressing and assessing patient's needs • Routines for the providing of cancer rehabilitation services • Routines for documentation • Educational resources • Individual care plans • Quality indicators for evaluation and further development CONCLUSIONS: There's a need for research from the multi-scientific approach of innovational sciences to draw forth organizational, social and technical innovations concerning cancer rehabilitation. The development and implementation of these innovations needs to be conducted close to clinical practice and include stakeholders to take an active role in the innovation process.Through national guidelines we can define the “what” should be done when it comes to cancer rehabilitation. When it comes to putting the guidelines into practice the next step is to define the “how”, “when” and “who” and this should be done within the context where it shall thrive. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: How can we create working models for integrated services that really can put science and policy into practice? This project has been initiated and conducted within clinical practice but has evolved into a model which gives a perfect platform for research on the innovation and implementation of integrated cancer rehabilitation services. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: How can clinicians get policies and guidelines to work in their unique context? How can cancer care work together with cancer survivors to facilitate an innovational process that will evolve cancer care services that can face the needs of cancer survivors that today stand as unmet needs?.

%X Objective: TOXlearning, the UK clinical toxicology e-learning resource developed by NPIS Edinburgh, went live in September 2005 providing training on using TOXBASE® ; additional modules were added in July 2008 (Management of the poisoned patient) and September 2010 (Management of patients involved in chemical incidents). The objective of this work was to identify users'usage patterns, and assess their experience of the resource. Methods: Web usage statistics were analysed. All users since 2005 were e-mailed a quality assurance questionnaire and returns analysed. Results: At 30/09/11 3270 individuals had registered since the site's launch; 2905 completing modules on the first unit, 690 the second, 161 the third. Users have training-level access to TOXBASE®, the UK clinical toxicology database. The top TOXBASE® monographs accessed closely matched the main substances covered in the first module (e.g. antifreeze/ ethylene glycol, paracetamol, ferrous sulphate, etc). As newer modules came online covering different topics, hits on corresponding monographs rose up the ranks (e.g. from the second module digoxin rose from 77th to 18th; from the third module sulphur mustard and carbon monoxide ranked for the first time). Only 2425 users'e-mail addresses remained valid; 59.4% (1439) “official” addresses/40.6% (986) private accounts. Responders were ambulance staff 28.1% (37), nurses 21.2% (28), doctors 18.1% (24), NHS 24/Direct 16.6% (22), and other 15.9% (21). All user types responded similarly and positively when asked to grade statements concerning ease of access, attractiveness of resource and ease of navigation. On a scale of 1 - 6 (1 = disagree completely/6 = agree completely) they agreed “a lot” or “completely” that learning was pitched at the right level (75.0% [99]), and that the subject matter was interesting (88.6% [117]). On a scale of 1- 5 (1 = very poor/5 = very good) 93.3% (124) rated their overall satisfaction 4 or 5. Conclusion: As potentially 7 years could have passed since first registration the response rate (5.6% [135]) was, as expected, low. A large proportion of users registered using private e-mail accounts to facilitate learning from home. Users took the opportunity to use training-level access to TOXBASE® to support their e-learning activities. Irrespective of user type respondents indicated a high degree of confidence and satisfaction with the resource.

%X Nurse educators claim accountability to ensure their students are prepared to assume leadership responsibilities upon graduation. Although front-line nurse leaders and nurse executives feel new graduates are not adequately prepared to take on basic leadership roles, professional nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) deem leadership skills are core competencies of new graduate nurses. This study includes comparison of a leadership-focused multi-patient simulation and the traditional leadership clinical experiences in a baccalaureate nursing leadership course. The results of this research show both environments contribute to student learning. There was no statistical difference in the overall score. Students perceived a statistically significant difference in communication with patients in the traditional inpatient environment. However, the students perceived a statistical significant difference in teaching-learning dyad toward simulation.

%X In the United States, medical care consumes approximately $1.2 trillion annually (14% of the gross domestic product) and involves 250,000 physicians, almost 1 million nurses, and countless other providers. While the Information Age has changed virtually every other facet of our life, the education of these healthcare professionals, both present and future, is largely mired in the 100-year-old apprenticeship model best exemplified by the phase "see one, do one, teach one." Continuing medical education is even less advanced. While the half-life of medical information is less than 5 years, the average physician practices 30 years and the average nurse 40 years. Moreover, as medical care has become increasingly complex, medical error has become a substantial problem. The current convulsive climate in academic health centers provides an opportunity to rethink the way medical education is delivered across a continuum of professional lifetimes. If this is well executed, it will truly make medical education better, safer, and cheaper, and provide real benefits to patient care, with instantaneous access to learning modules. At the Center for Advanced Technology in Surgery at Stanford we envision this future: within the next 10 years we will select, train, credential, remediate, and recredential physicians and surgeons using simulation, virtual reality, and Web-based electronic learning. Future physicians will be able to rehearse an operation on a projectable palpable hologram derived from patient-specific data, and deliver the data set of that operation with robotic assistance the next day. © 2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

%X BACKGROUND: Webinars has become an innovative and popular media for clinicians to obtain information/education at their fingertips Psychiatry constitutes only one part of a cancer center's mental health team as the highest trained and least available resource. Social workers are more plentiful and could be used to improve utilization of psychiatric services. We developed an interactive educational program for Social Workers to enhance their skills in identifying, interviewing, documenting and triaging patients for depression. (face-to-face & webminars). METHOD: A 6 week, (face-to-face & webinar versions) interactive SW Depression educational module was developed. A template was developed to ensure inclusion of clinically relevant material appropriate for SW: safety, symptoms and severity. Modalities of face-to-face teaching included PowerPoint, ARS (audience response system), videotaped case with MSE writing assignment and live feedback, model patient interview with case discussion, and observed live patient interviews with feedback. We used a mixed method approach to develop and evaluate the program that included a needs assessment, pre and post SW self efficacy measures, and class/instructor evaluations. The Webinar version of the series was delivered via Blackboard. RESULTS: The interactive educational series was piloted in fall 2010. Feedback identified a need for on-going continuing education of new SW a webinar version of the series was developed via HOPEBOARD (Blackboard). Thus allowing, continued and standardized education of SW's. Evaluation data was collected to ensure the program is being implemented as intended, identify areas for curriculum improvement and to gain feedback on each sub-topic. Multi-variate analysis are being used to evaluate and cross compare perceived efficacy of curriculum between those that completed face to face module versus online module. And to bring forth additional insights for development of future programs centered around delirium and suicide. CONCLUSIONS: This curriculum integrates learning with the fundamentals of psychosocial care in depressed cancer patients; by improving the participants skill capacity and enhancing their self efficacy to identify, assess, document and triage depressed cancer cases. The curriculum was implemented and formatively evaluated amongst 25 social workers in the fall 2010 and summer 2011. The results of the evaluated guided revisions to the curriculum and initiated a quick response to the development of an online educational series for new social work staff that can also be adapted for nursing staff. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The purpose of this study was to develop, implement and formatively evaluate innovative approaches to continued enhancement of depression curriculum for social workers in a cancer setting through the development of face to face and online educational modules. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is not clear if the Depression education module improved SW psychiatric triage. It did increase SW awareness and identification of patients with depressive symptoms, reflected in increased email/verbal communication between SW/psychiatry around clinical issues. And increased clinical collaboration between SW/psychiatry around assessment and triage of patients. Thus, a larger percentage of patients could be reached with appropriate level of intervention. This positive benefit provides a foundation for building and expanding a solid clinical programs.

%X Traditionally, companies have managed their constituencies with specific processes: marketing to customers, procuring from vendors, developing HR policies for employees, and so on. The problem is, such processes focus on repeatability and compliance, so they can lead to stagnation. Inviting your constituencies to collectively help you solve problems and exploit opportunities--"co-creation"--is a better approach. It allows you to continually tap the skills and insights of huge numbers of stakeholders and develop new ways to produce value for all. The idea is to provide stakeholders with platforms (physical and digital forums) on which they can interact, get them to start exploring new experiences and connections, and let the system grow organically. A co-creation initiative by a unit of Becton, Dickinson and Company demonstrates how this works. A global leader in syringes, BD set out to deepen its ties with hospital customers and help them reduce the incidence of infections from unsafe injection and syringe disposal practices. The effort began with a cross-functional internal team, brought in the hospital procurement and supply managers BD had relationships with, and then reached out to hospitals' infection-prevention and occupational health leaders. Eventually product designers, nurses, sustainability staffers, and even hospital CFOs were using the platform, contributing data that generated new best practices and reduced infections.

%X BACKGROUND: Online learning is frequently used in continuing professional development for qualified nurses and midwives. It is frequently assumed that the same package is appropriate for different groups of learners and that by reducing the need for tutorial input, tutorial time is saved. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the suitability of an online learning resource for suitability in continuing professional development for midwives. Originally developed for use as part of a work-based package for a specific audience, there had always been plans for more general use of the resource with other groups of health workers. DESIGN: Sequential mixed methods study. SETTING: English universities. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy university tutors. METHODS: Online questionnaire and in-depth interviews. FINDINGS: Tutors did not consider that the online learning materials would be suitable for a wider audience without significant adaptation. They thought that uptake would increase need for tutorial input. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the pitfalls of removing learning from the context of practice. Technology customised to meet the needs of one group of learners probably does not have the potential for transfer to another group without significant adaptation. Those responsible for designing e-learning should take into account the needs of all the different audiences for whom the resource is intended from the outset, with consideration for the context in which learning will be applied to practice and how students will be supported. If the same package is to be used by different audiences and in different settings, tutors and students will require explicit instructions of how they should use the resource and depth of knowledge and level of competency that should be attained at the conclusion of the programme.

%X Background: In 2000, the Joint Stroke Strategy Working Group (Ontario) devised a blueprint for stroke care for Ontario. Included in the proposal were funded Secondary Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPC's) to provide timely access to diagnostic services, evidence based medical treatment and nurse-led risk reduction interventions. Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) opened one of the first prevention clinics in the province in 2000, and in 2006, a second part time clinic in Hamilton was funded. HHS and St. Joseph's Hospital Hamilton enjoy a partnership that includes a central referral process, bi-monthly administrative meetings, physician crossover, the collaborative development of teaching materials and performance and evaluation measures based on Canadian Best Practice Stroke Recommendations. Methods: The Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network SPIRIT SPC Module (2007) provides a platform for monitoring and evaluation of care. From April 2007 - March 2010 3,842 patients were referred to SPC's. Results: Almost half (48.9%) of those cases were deemed “Non- strokes”. 675/1507 (44.8%) were referred from Emergency Rooms ; 433/1507 (28.7%) were from family practice. The overall median wait time from stroke event to SPC visit was 29 (IQR 20 - 45), in cases triaged as urgent, the median dropped to 8 days (IQR 6 -15). 94.1%of non elective referrals were deemed to be assessed “on time” according to the 2008 Canadian Best Practice Stroke Recommendations. Conclusions: Best practices in stroke care have been translated into practice and stroke prevention services have grown in Hamilton, Ontario.

%X Background. Untrained laparoscopic camera assistants in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) may cause suboptimal view of the operating field, thereby increasing risk for errors. Camera navigation is often performed by the least experienced member of the operating team, such as inexperienced surgical residents, operating room nurses, and medical students. The operating room nurses and medical students are currently not included as key user groups in structured laparoscopic training programs. A new virtual reality laparoscopic camera navigation (LCN) module was specifically developed for these key user groups. Methods. This multicenter prospective cohort study assesses face validity and construct validity of the LCN module on the Simendo virtual reality simulator. Face validity was assessed through a questionnaire on resemblance to reality and perceived usability of the instrument among experts and trainees. Construct validity was assessed by comparing scores of groups with different levels of experience on outcome parameters of speed and movement proficiency. Results. The results obtained show uniform and positive evaluation of the LCN module among expert users and trainees, signifying face validity. Experts and intermediate experience groups performed significantly better in task time and camera stability during three repetitions, compared to the less experienced user groups (P <.007). Comparison of learning curves showed significant improvement of proficiency in time and camera stability for all groups during three repetitions (P <.007). Conclusion. The results of this study show face validity and construct validity of the LCN module. The module is suitable for use in training curricula for operating room nurses and novice surgical trainees, aimed at improving team performance in minimally invasive surgery. © The Author(s) 2013.

%X Background: Transfusion in the UK is safe, however, errors involving medical staff in the decision making or prescribing of blood products continues to occur. This is despite three yearly competency assessments being required by all staff clinically involved in the blood transfusion process. Aims: This qualitative research aims to better understand how doctors are currently educated in transfusion medicine. To explore how the delivery of transfusion education could be improved and to examine the role of competency assessment in transfusion practice for this population. Methods: Focus groups were held with healthcare personnel to explore views and experiences concerning education and competency assessment in transfusion medicine. Doctors from all disciplines and stages of training were included, in addition to personnel with practical experience of transfusion education. Participant contributions were audio-recorded, transcribed and categorised into current education, ideal education and competency assessment. Analysis of recurrent themes created specific guidance on when, what, who and how to deliver transfusion education. Focus groups continued to be held until no new themes were emergent from data analysis. Results: A total of eight focus groups were held involving 53 participants. Healthcare personnel included medical undergraduates through to consultant doctors, plus advanced nurse and transfusion practitioners. It was clear from the focus groups that formal transfusion education for doctors is most commonly delivered on-line as part of mandatory hospital (Trust) induction and is viewed as a 'tick-box exercise'. In the clinical setting, education of junior doctors occurs through cascade training from senior clinical or nursing staff. Recurrent themes from focus groups highlighted the following recommendations: • Deliver transfusion education to undergraduates, first year doctors (FY1) then every 3 years to all clinicians. • Mandate transfusion education and deliver in 'protected time' away from clinical practice. • Focus on the practicalities of transfusion and tailor to the stage of training and clinical role of the recipient. • Deliver education face-to-face by a good educator who is knowledgeable in transfusion and understands the recipient's clinical role. • The Hospital Transfusion Committee should be responsible for quality assuring Trust-wide delivery of transfusion education. Ensure transfusion resources and guidelines are easily accessible. • Establish a nationally recognised, multi-disciplinary transfusion course, to addresses the principles and theories of transfusion medicine. Use small-group, case-based teaching/discussion and simulation training e.g. for acute transfusion reactions, massive haemorrhage management, to promote inter-professional collaborative learning. • Incorporate clinical competency assessment into the national course. • Outside of this setting, attempting competency assessment was not seen to be beneficial, other than in practical skills such as prescribing for junior doctors. Conclusion: Within the UK, the current method of e-learning in transfusion medicine is ineffective. There is significant scope to improve the way transfusion education is delivered to doctors and other healthcare personnel. This could be achieved by adopting a nationally recognised, multidisciplinary transfusion course, which would employ face-to-face teaching tailored to differing learner styles. Combined with clinical competency assessment, this course would enhance delivery of Patient Blood Management and optimise safe transfusion practice.

%X Objectives: To provide evidence-based guidance on how transfusion education should be delivered to junior doctors by employing established qualitative research methodology. Background: There is a global call for increased transfusion education for doctors to support the delivery of evidence-based practice. Education is reported as an effective measure to improve transfusion practice, although there is a paucity of research evaluating how this should be effectively delivered. Methods: Serial focus groups with junior doctors and relevant healthcare professionals explored experiences of, and reactions to, education and competency assessments in transfusion, which were audio-recorded and transcribed. Temporal and final analysis, performed by two independent assessors, informed subsequent recruitment, analysis and challenging of emerging theories - until saturation was reached. Results: Eight focus groups were held involving 53 personnel, 77% of whom were junior doctors. Current transfusion education for doctors in the UK is reliant on e-learning and 'cascade training' (on-the-job from senior clinicians/nursing staff). E-learning is viewed as a 'tick box exercise'. There is a call for relevant and practical continuing education delivered face to face by good educators in an environment away from clinical practice. Preferred methods include small group and simulation learning based on real-life cases. In contrast to practical competency, the assessment of clinical competency is deemed unfeasible. Conclusion: Current methods of transfusion education employed in the UK are unsatisfactory to ensure safe transfusion practice. Ongoing education is deemed necessary throughout career progression, and suggested improvements include increased emphasis on face-to-face teaching and simulation training. Employed educational methods and decision support tools require appropriate evaluation.

%X The idea for this research and practice development project emerged from the production of a recently published book of recovery narratives, written by a community of people broadly working in the mental health recovery movement. • The research component of this project, described in this paper, sits within: narrative inquiry as a moral endeavour in the human sciences; the pedagogy of suffering in the sociology of health and illness; and mental health narrative recovery. • Two inter-related data sources will be used in the research. The first is chapters contributed by authors to the book. The second is interview data from those authors. • Integrative textual and interview transcript analysis will extend to the end of 2012. • The research component of this project represents a commitment to a mental health nursing practice allied to recovery as narrative healing as opposed to forms of psychiatric nursing which endorse and tacitly support abuses committed in the name of institutional psychiatry. This paper, part one of a two paper report, describes key aspects of the research context of an ongoing practice development project, conducted on two UK sites. The paper begins with a discussion of the project's origins within a community of people working in the recovery paradigm, including the contributory strand of the first author's recovery and survivor writing. The discussion then turns to three inter-related areas within which the research component sits and which provide it with philosophical, theoretical and conceptual coherence. Each area will be unpacked and its significance explained. This will provide a platform for discussing the focus, methodology and methods of the research, and related assumptions governing both data collection and analysis. The paper concludes with a research commitment to a mental health nursing practice allied to recovery as narrative healing. Links are made to the second paper which describes the context and specifics of a Writing for Recovery project for users, survivors and carers. This shares with, and builds on, the overall project's research context and its assumptions. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing.

%X Background: Medical education, professional networking and communication are changing as social media becomes more integral to the lives of academics, doctors, health care professionals and patients. Social media (SoMe) is gaining popularity as a platform for informal, user-directed learning; the ease with which educational material and discussion can be accessed from multiple devices is key to this. Aims: We aimed to develop a hematology-oriented presence within SoMe. We wanted to promote Hematology as a specialty willing to engage in international and truely multi-disciplinary dialogue via the most modern platforms. We also wanted to create an educational dialogue that would allow interested parties, from the smallest to largest institutions, to participate in teaching and the dissemination of knowledge. Methods: We chose Twitter, a free, widely used SoMe microblogging website as it allows instant dissemination and discussion of educational material. Our Twitter profile (@TeamHaem) contains a short biography of who we are and our objectives. @TeamHaem established a Twitter presence by 'following' education and medical professionals, enabling us to see their status updates. We subsequently asked them to 'tweet' about us; therefore gaining our own followers. We created case-led discussions, which evolve over time and are designed to be topical and relevant to our followers, targeting their various skill sets and levels of expertise. We used a blogging website to create the backbone of our case and Twitter to lead the discussion. Images, such as blood films, radiographs and marrow histology can be posted in addition to links from journal articles. Any follower can contribute or can simply watch the case developing. We react to followers' suggestions and encourage evidence- based discussion, closing each case with a summary. We moderate discussion and explicitly refrain from offering medical advice. Results: @TeamHaem has been operational since 2012 and we currently have 1296 followers from 112 countries around the world, including doctors, nurses, students, pharmacists and biomedical scientists. We have published 32 interactive cases so far. We have also presented at medical education conferences and participated in the twitter coverage of various hematology conferences, including The Americal Society of Hematology 2014 congress which was the topic of over 20,000 tweets. We have encountereed numerous difficulties with this project, including technological literacy, compliance with confidentiality and SoMe guidelines, time management and promotion of the service to non-Twitter users. These obstacles have been overcome by following published guidelines, seeking advice from senior colleagues, presenting at local and national meetings and publishing in specialty specific newsletters. Summary and Conclusions: Hematology is a specialty that is frequently scientifically ground-breaking. Many in the field are interested in methods of sharing knowledge and promoting the specialty, as well as learning from colleagues. @TeamHaem is an entirely novel programme which has succeeded in developing an international network for professionals and students working in Hematology. We have over 1000 followers from more than 100 countries and continue to curate high quality educational networks and debate for the Hematology community.

%X In 1999 the Scottish Government Health Department (SGHD) published a health service circular recommending that all staff involved in the transfusion process were supported by training and education (MEL1999(9)). A further health service circular launching the NHS Scotland (NHSS) Better Blood Transfusion (BBT) Programme in 2003 reinforced this recommendation (NHSHDL(2003)19)). To assist NHS Scotland hospitals implement the recommendations, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) developed the Learnbloodtransfusion (LBT) continuing education programme. The aim of the LBT education programme is to assist all staff involved in the transfusion process provide high standards of care to patients, improve transfusion practice and minimize risk to patients and practitioners. The LBT programme is delivered using a variety of teaching methods including: face-to-face teaching programmes, written support and self-directed learning materials, and an interactive eLearning resource, www.learnbloodtransfusion.org.uk. The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland Clinical Transfusion Standards recommend the Module 1: Safe Transfusion Practice as mandatory for all staff involved in the transfusion process in Scotland (www.nhshealthquality.org). The Learnbloodtransfusion programme has been developed by UK subject experts and currently includes the following modules: 1. Module 1: Safe Transfusion Practice 2. Module 2: Blood Component Use 3. Module 3: Appropriate Transfusion Practice 4. Good Manufacturing Practice for Hospital Blood Banks The Scottish Clinical Transfusion Advisory Committee has recommended that all staff involved in blood transfusion revalidate their training every two years. In 2009/10 over 23,000 of eligible NHSS staff, (e.g. 34% of doctors, 62% of nurses, 67% of phlebotomists, 46% of porters and clinical support workers) held a valid training certificate for Module 1: Safe Transfusion Practice; approximately 60% of the target indicator for all staff in NHS Scotland hospitals. A number of initiatives have been used to maximise user uptake in the hospitals including local training agreements owned by the hospital clinical managers, regular training reports disseminated to all NHS Hospital Transfusion Committees and clinical managers by the BBT Transfusion Practitioners (TPs) and review of individual training certificates as part of the practitioner's annual performance review meeting. In 2010, we have added new functionality to the eLearning Learner Management System (learnPro NHS™) that allows the BTT Transfusion Practitioners and clinical managers to identify staff with valid, elapsed (a defined grace period in which staff can renew their training), or expired training records, targeting learners via automated emails advising them their training is about to expire. The BBT programme has also committed to a promotional programme in 2010, developing a communication strategy targeting the promotion and revalidation of blood transfusion education. Promotional materials included individual messaging e.g. staff pay slips, revalidation memos, dissemination of promotional items (pens, pencils, mouse mats) and centrally produced posters and leaflets promoting the LBT web address and key message; staff must have current, valid training to participate in the transfusion process. Each hsopital is encouraged to use the promotional materials at promotional and regular training events. The NHSS Better Blood Transfusion remains committed to supporting all staff in Scotland achieve training appropriate to their role and to monitoring effectiveness.

%X Aim: To carry out a post-impact evaluation of a cross-infection control CD-ROM, developed for NHS dental teams as a continuing professional development e-learning tool. The program was commissioned by the Department of Health and developed by a project team through the UK Committee of Postgraduate Dental Deans. The Dental Practice Board had originally sent one copy of the CD-ROM to each dental practice in England in 2004. Method: A quantitative statistical analysis of the results of 326 online respondents to the learning package and a survey of 118 dental practitioners drawn from the Dental Practice Board database. Results: Practitioners felt the CD-ROM in this instance was well-designed and appropriate for their needs. It is inclusive and accessible to a wide range of dental professionals including nurses and hygienists. Conclusions: This form of continuing professional development is popular with dental practitioners, although it should not be the only form of continuing professional development available. However, whilst the project was generally regarded as successful, there were problems with the distribution of the CD-ROM.

%X Objectives: 1) Examine the use of a virtual learning environment for the delivery of pandemic flu patient surge functional drills for emergency department (ED) nurses and hospital incident command personnel, and 2) Explore the use of a multi-user virtual environment to enable a team-based approach to patient triage during a surge in health care utilization. Virtual environments can support an approach to learning that emphasizes student-centeredness and enables learning to be related to context and practice. In collaborative learning theory, the learner is seen as an active participant in the learning process, constructing knowledge through interaction with peers and instructors. Within the multi-user virtual environment, a user can interact by virtue of an avatar, a computerized character that represents the user. The avatar manipulates and interacts with objects in the virtual world. These virtual worlds are shared spaces where an entire organization of learners can simultaneously experience the same standardized yet evolving online world. These characteristics make virtual worlds more like the real world and less like the static, intermittent, stand-alone exercises and games used in traditional emergency preparedness training. We will present the results of our pilot studies to develop a curriculum for ED nurses and hospital incident command staff to deal with a large influx of patients. We will also present our curriculum and show how students learned to: 1) function in their job class in a virtual world; 2) obtain Healthcare Incident Command System (HICS) training; 3) practice Emergency Severity Index and START (simple triage and rapid transport) triage on simulated virtual patients; 4) perform several functional team exercises; and 5) visualize and evaluate their own performances during the functional drills. We will show video clips (machinimas) of the virtual lessons. We will also discuss our lessons learned including improved team communication, planning, team decision-making, and the ability to visually debrief. We hope that participants will come away with a new appreciation for how this immersive teaching method can support the delivery of disaster management education through all phases of the cycle (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery).

%X Professional development opportunities for nurses are increasingly being offered in the online environment and therefore it is imperative that learning designers, nurse educators and healthcare organisations consider how best to support staff to enable Registered Nurses to capitalise on the resources available. Research participants explored educational strategies to support digitally differentiated nurses' engagement with professional development activities in an online environment through a participatory action research project that collected data over a 16 month period through six focus groups before being analysed thematically. The reality of work-based, e-learning while managing clinical workloads can be problematic however specific measures, such as having a quiet space and computer away from the clinical floor, access to professional development resources from anywhere and at any time, can be effective. A 'one-size-fits-all' approach to resources offered will not meet the needs of diverse staffing groups whereas heutagogical learning offers tangible benefits to Registered Nurses seeking professional development opportunities in this context. Apparent proficiency with technological skills may not reflect a Registered Nurse's actual ability in this environment and face-to-face support offered regularly, rather than remedially, can be beneficial for some staff. Implementing specific strategies can result in successful transition to the online environment.

%X The Association of American Medical Colleges has called for an increase of 30% in matriculation in United States medical schools to treat the growing number of elderly patients with chronic illnesses. However, increasing the physician supply is unlikely to address the underlying problem, that being the growth of chronic disease, which necessitates a shift in orientation from treatment to management and prevention. This shift will in turn require a change in the makeup of health care providers. Instead of more physicians, more nonphysician professionals must be trained so as to aggressively coordinate comprehensive chronic disease care. A disease management model led by physicians, but including advanced practice nurses and other professionals, offers the opportunity to enhance efficiency, improve quality, reduce hospitalization, and meet evidence-based mandates. Such a workforce transition can become the inaugural step in converting the entire health care system from treatment based to prevention and management based. In conclusion, the position of the Association of American Medical Colleges should be a platform for discussion. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Background/Case Studies: For several years the Transfusion Committee discussed and investigated how to utilize blood components more appropriately and conservatively. The motivation to accelerate the project was based on a transfusion-associated sentinel event at our facility. To eliminate internal bias, an independent blood management consulting company was hired to provide guidance, analytic skills, education and direction in pursuing change. Study Design/Methods: Project initiation involved developing and sharing a blood management strategy. A webinar introduced nursing staff to their comprehensive role in blood management and transfusion safety. Data collection for analysis consisted of patient level data, blood component costs, annual utilization by component type, wastage, transfusion reaction rate/type, sample rejection rate and routine phlebotomy volume. From the patient data submitted, a representative number of medical records was chosen for further in-house analysis. The consulting group representatives' first on-site visit focused on 2 days of chart review, direct observations and interviews with Perfusion, Blood Bank, Nursing management and Hospital executive management. Information gleaned during this phase finalized opportunities for improvement (OFI) recommendations. Results/Findings: The process from data/information collection to recommendation proposal occurred quickly. Results were discussed in multiple settings to individual groups, first to Hospital executive management, followed by consulting group on-site peer presentations to specific groups: physician to physicians, nurse to nursing, physician to Pathology leadership. Recommended OFIs for change consisted of: 1) Training Opportunities-specialized training for physicians, nurses and patients; 2) Proper Component Usage-modify transfusion criteria, informed consent form and audit accordingly; 3) Reduce Risk to Patient-ensure both standardized product administration and adverse event identification and follow-up; 4) Pre- and Perioperative Practices-identify and manage anemia to prevent unnecessary transfusion in elective surgery; 5) Synergy-interdisciplinary communication to focus on common goals: patient safety and quality outcomes; 6) Blood Conservation-reduce wastage and unnecessary transfusions; 7) Sustainment-identify project champions and hire a Blood Management Coordinator. Conclusion: By design, the project moved quickly. Keeping up the momentum in our academic medical center may be a challenge. Given the multiple OFIs identified, the Transfusion Committee prioritized the projects for initial implementation: Education & Communication, Iatrogenic Blood Loss, Pre-Surgical Anemia Management and Transfusion Guideline Refinement. Implementation workgroups were deployed and the work began. And the journey continues.

%X Background During the morning medicines round, an 82-year-old resident received another resident's treatment by mistake. The nurse's aide realised her mistake and warned the charge nurse upon her arrival. The doctor was informed and the appropriate surveillance was implemented. That same evening, following a significant decrease in alertness and low blood pressure, the resident was admitted to intensive care. The following morning, the resident was declared dead. A root cause analysis was performed with the support of the “Regional Platform of Support for the Management of Adverse Events”. Purpose To demonstrate the benefits of a root cause analysis in the management of serious adverse events. Material and methods The root cause analysis was performed using the Orion method. This method includes the following steps: i) data collection, ii) chronology of events, iii) identification of gaps, iv) identification of contributing and influencing factors, v) development of action plan, vi) drafting analytical report. Results The root cause analysis was performed by medical and paramedical professionals as well as management representatives. Corrective actions were proposed: i) ensure “double-check” patient's identity by writing a drug distribution procedure and training all staff members, ii) raise team awareness by sharing this feedback (posters, scenario analysis), iii) identify drug distribution boxes with a photo ID, iv) expand the workspace, v) improve the working conditions of the agents (new organisation, risk study). Conclusion As a result of the root cause analysis, corrective actions involving all concerned agents have been implemented. These actions not only helped to make drug administration safer but also to educate the teams, set up more secured work environments and to develop identity monitoring. Systematising the practice of root cause analysis is required in nursing homes as part of the continuous improvement of quality and the safety of patient care. The pharmacist plays an important role in this new risk management.

%X Health-care professionals need an appropriate genetics knowledge base to care for patients and their families. However, studies have indicated that nurses and midwives lack the requisite genetics knowledge to practice effectively and safely, with a paucity of resources to address their educational needs. This paper describes an action research study aimed at developing an online genetics resource for students and practitioners in a range of health professions. A literature review of current health-care genetics education was undertaken. In the first phase of the action cycle, a sample of nurses and midwives were surveyed using a questionnaire to discover their perceived learning needs and the acceptability of an e-learning approach. Using the findings, an online resource for health professionals was developed, by means of a life stage structure to expedite accessibility. The developmental process leading to the construction of clinical case studies in this resource (including theory, ethical, and practical issues) and the evaluation strategy are discussed. © 2007 The Authors; Journal Compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

%X Introduction The recent report on future models of care for pharmacy1 highlighted that, community pharmacy has not been fully integrated into primary care teams. This may be because other health care professionals (HCPs) do not fully understand the role of the CP.1 Better integration of CPs with other HCPs on clinical teams is seen as important for enabling the extension of the pharmacist's role and may improve patient care.2 This study aimed to explore CPs', GPs' and PNs' perceptions of teamwork in order to better understand what might improve CP integration. Methods A survey of CPs, GPs and PNs in southwest England. Closedand open-ended questions were developed from a pilot study with pharmacists. Respondents were asked whether they considered themselves part of a MDT, then about their MDTs or whether they would like to be part of a MDT. Benefits and barriers to multidisciplinary work were also explored. The survey was available online or in paper format. Recruitment was through primary care research networks, professional journals and networks, Twitter and direct contact with practices/ pharmacies. Data were entered into SPSS for statistical analysis; content analysis was used with free text responses. Ethical approval was granted by University. Results One hundred sixty-two CPs, 214 GPs and 147 PNs responded; response rates could not be calculated we did not know how many viewed study advertisements or social media. However 589 online and 219 postal surveys were requested or distributed. Nearly all GPs (99%) and PNs (98%) considered themselves part of a MDT, compared to 78% of CPs. Of those who felt part of a team, 56% of GPs and 57% of PNs counted a CP on their team, while 85% of CPs included GPs and PNs on their teams. The most commonly cited reason by GPs and PNs for not considering a CP on their team was lack of face-to-face contact. Main reasons for including a CPwere valuing the CP's expertise in medicines and their knowledge of patients. Many also stated the CP had a key role in conducting and monitoring patient care. The main reason for not feeling part of aMDTwas lack of contact with other HCPs. Almost all not on a team wanted to be. The main benefits of MDTs were improved patient care and efficiency. For CPs and PNs a key barrier was poor communication, whereas GPs mainly reported a lack of time for meetings. Discussion The proportion of CPs who considered themselves part of a MDT was encouragingly high; however there still is a lack of acceptance of CPs as team members among GPs and PNs. Although the study was small, differences between groups can help explain why better integration has not occurred. In order to integrate CPs into primary care teams, other HCPs need to be made aware of the benefits that CPs bring to team working. CPs also need to be made aware of the importance that GPs and PNs place on face-to-face communication and recognise that some in-person communication is likely to be necessary for integration into the MDT.

%X Background: An eLearning program (PEDALO) was developed in 2014 to support the acquisition of clinical reasoning and clinical judgement skills in nurses new to the NICU. Measurement of outcomes in eLearning programs is often limited to practitioner responses and self-evaluation, measuring the translation of learning to clinical setting remains difficult. Confidence was seen as a potential outcome measure in evaluating knowledge translation in the PEDALO program. Method: The validated C-Scale tool (Grundy:1993) was incorporated in the eLearning program to assess the nurses' confidence before and after completion of the modules and six weeks after completion of the program. Confidence was assessed against 5 comments using a Likert scale. A total score of 25 indicated high confidence and a score of 5 low confidence. Results: 14 nurses (10 novice and 4 experienced) tested the program. Pre eLearning program completion confidence ranged from 14 to 21 with a mean 17.5. Post program scores ranged from 8 to 25 with a mean 17.2. Six weeks after the completion of the program confidence ranged from 15 to 21 with a mean 16. Conclusion: Clinical education program are required as these results support what may be expected across learners with higher confidence prior to completing an educational program with an immediate decrease in confidence following completion of the program as what is and is not known becomes apparent and a further decrease in the following weeks as this knowledge is tested in the clinical setting.

%X Background. Non-technical skills (NTS) are cognitive, social and personal resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task performance. Six core NTS are relevant to endoscopy: teamwork, communication, situational awareness, decision making, leadership and professionalism. The need for NTS competence is acknowledged by gastroenterology organizations such as CAG and ASGE but there is minimal evidence supporting the effectiveness of curricular NTS training. Aims. To assess the effectiveness of a simulation-based curriculum in NTS on novice endoscopists' performance of simulated colonoscopy. Methods. 20 novice endoscopists were randomized to 2 groups. The conventional training group received 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic sessions on colonoscopy theory and 6 hours of simulation-based training (SBT) that started on bench-top simulators (low fidelity) and progressed to virtual reality (VR) simulators (high fidelity). Hours 5 and 6 of SBT were integrated scenarios wherein participants interacted with a standardized patient and nurse while performing a VR simulated colonoscopy. The NTS group also received the same didactic sessions with hour 6 focusing on NTS, and 6 hours of SBT that progressed from low- to high-fidelity simulators, including integrated scenarios. Prior to each integrated scenario, participants reviewed a checklist of relevant core NTS concepts. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately after training, and 4-6 weeks post-training. The primary outcome was NTS performance during an integrated scenario test, measured by OSANTS, an assessment tool for NTS in surgery modified for endoscopy. Secondary outcomes were attitudes towards NTS measured by TEAMSTEPPS, a validated questionnaire of NTS perception; and global performance and communication during integrated scenarios respectively assessed using ISGRF and ISCRF, two previously validated rating scales. Results. The NTS group outperformed the conventional training group on the integrated scenarios immediately after training and 4-6 weeks after training, in terms of NTS specific performance (p < 0.003), global performance (p < 0.04) and communication (p < 0.01). The NTS group regarded NTS more positively as compared to the conventional training group (p < 0.003). Conclusions. A colonoscopy simulation-based curriculum focused on NTS improved NTS performance, communication and global performance during simulated colonoscopy encounters, and attitudes regarding NTS. Further research should evaluate the impact of a NTS curriculum on clinical colonoscopy performance.

%X Purpose: The challenges on cardiovascular nursing are to provide holistic evidence based care. Literature confirms the necessity to address this topic. Several studies show that nurses tend to be the controlling part in nursepatient interaction and refrain from investigating the patients' points of view in health care matters. Nurses must recognize patients' specific needs and experiences related to living life with disease. Literature point out to pay attention to nurses values, reflection and communication competences. The aim is to challenge this in a clinical setting - an acute cardiology ward receiving patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI in a 3-day inpatient stay. Methods: Following activities have been conducted: (1) A systematic literature search - (2) A pilot test of an evidence based worksheet - (3) Communication training - (4) Patient feedback. (Ad 1) Systematic literature search has been carried out focusing patients' needs and experiences. (Ad 2) Zoffmann (2004) has developed a nurse-patient interaction method, Guided Self-Determination (GSD). This method is designed to guide patients as well as professionals in their interaction based on semi-structured worksheets, which was tested among 15 patients. (Ad 3) As part of GSD, Zoffmann recommends communication training. All nurses in the ward conducted a training programme based on communication techniques. Focus was mirroring, active listening and values clarification. (Ad 4) Discharged patients were invited to a meeting, where they explained their needs and experiences during the acute admission. Results: The worksheet became a platform for the planning of the individually based care. The patients' needs varied from practical implications relating to their disease, to coping and to existential thoughts but also to individual needs, the nurses were not able to predict. The nurses had some barriers. By handing over the sheet the power is transferred to the patient. Most of the patients gave positive feedback and felt more ready to cope with the situation. Feedback from discharged patients provided knowledge, too, significant for the professional interaction. The analysis of the results from the literature search will be a part of an overall nurse intervention to meet the patients' needs for health care in the acute phase. Conclusions: If we want a theoretically and research driven practice, validated methods exist to improve holistically based care.

%X The inadequate use of syringe pumps can jeopardize patient safety, and syringe pump trainings are conducted to manage this risk. A critical step in this risk management process is the learning success of trainees. In the present paper, we compared an e-learning approach with standard classroom training in learning success effectives, trainees' opinion on the trainings, and investigated the relation between technological affinity and learning success. The results showed that e-learning was as effective as classroom training but nursing students' confidence in using the pump and satisfaction with the training was decreased for e-learning compared with classroom training. We discuss the results in context of the nursing e-learning literature. Finally, we discuss the literature for risk identification, risk analysis, risk treatment, and risk monitoring and control in the context of syringe pump training and add the lessons learned from the evaluated e-learning program.

%X Introduction: Every year new pupils with Haemophilia start primary school. Being a rare disorder, there is a lack of knowledge amongst teachers about how to manage tricky situations resulting in high levels of anxiety for teachers, parents and pupils. A nurse from the Norwegian Centre travels to the local school to give talks about haemophilia and necessary supportive care needed. Long distance travels in Norway and the geographical spread of schools make this approach very resource heavy. With the advent of widely accessibly information technology, this presentation describes the setting up and content of an e-learning course for teachers. The e-learning course is aimed at both building knowledge on haemophilia for teachers in primary school and addressing any anxiety teachers may have about the support required by pupils with haemophilia. Methods: Using a web-based course a 30 minutes teaching programme has been developed and offered free of charge to teachers in Primary schools who have a new pupil with haemophilia. The programme includes: 1. What is haemophilia 2. Normal coagulation 3. Symptoms and treatment 4. What to be aware of 5. Where to find necessary and applicable knowledge 6. Short test-yourself exercises 7. Phone number of the centre for questions 8. The course is available from www.sjeldnediagnoser.no Results: The course has been available for 3 years and has given very good results. The teachers and the parents were told to contact the centre if things went wrong or the anxiety still was high. This has not happened at all. The teachers can take the course together or by themselves and it can be taken several times or they can repeat parts of it. Discussion/Conclusion: Experienced strengths of this approach will be presented and can be summarised as: 1. To make haemophilia better known, a variation of channels can be used 2. E-learning is cheap, easy to use and much less time consuming 3. The course can be taken several times or they can repeat parts of it.

%X Background Errors occur frequently during the medication process, from prescription to administration. They can lead to severe damage for patient health, particularly with injectable (IV) drugs. Purpose To evaluate the impact of a self-made e-learning lesson, focused on the safety of IV drug preparation and administration, on the ability of nurses and pharmacy students to detect errors voluntarily placed in a simulated patient's room ('room of errors'). Material and methods • Selection of 11 errors related to IV drug preparation and administration based on reported incidents. Study design: number of errors detected in 15 min in the 'room of errors' by nurses and pharmacy students before and after an e-learning lesson (30 min). • Evaluation of the impact of the e-learning on the mean number and type of detected errors (±SD), globally and in both populations. • Satisfaction evaluation (standardised questionnaire). Results • 28 participants (16 nurses/12 pharmacy students) were enrolled. The mean number of detected errors increased significantly after completion of the e-learning (4.6 ± 2.3 vs 2.6 ± 1.8; p < 0.0001). The e-learning had a greater impact on the detection of administration errors compared with preparation errors (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.5); p = 0.001). • Nurses: after e-learning, the mean number of detected errors increased (5.5 ± 2.5 vs 3.3 ± 2.0; p < 0.0001). The probability of detecting a preparation error (that was not detected before e-learning) was lower (21.6%; 95% CI 12.1 to 35.8) compared with administration errors (34.7%; 95% CI 20.5 to 52.4). • Pharmacy students: after e-learning, the mean number of detected errors increased (3.3 ± 1.1 vs 1.8 ± 1.1; p = 0.0001). The probability of detecting a preparation error (that was not detected before e-learning) was very low (3.8%; 95% CI 1.0 to 14.1) but higher for administration errors (27.3%; 95% CI 17.2 to 40.4). • Satisfaction evaluation: most of the participants (100% of nurses, 83% of pharmacy students) appreciated this concept of learning but it was judged more suitable for nurses' practice. Conclusion The e-learning lesson significantly improved the number of detected errors, particularly of administration errors. Long term impact and usefulness of this innovative pedagogic approach for continuing education should be evaluated in the future.

%X Faced with increasingly complex clinical situations, nurses must respond with accurate clinical judgment. But del Bueno (2005) reports that only 35 percent of new graduate nurses exhibit entry-level expectations of the necessary critical-thinking skills. Croskerry (2003) argues that clinicians' education should be directed at developing cognitive strategies that reduce errors in clinical decision-making. A challenge for nurse educators is finding activities to help students analyze their thinking as they address clinical problems. The author describes an assignment, given to third-year baccalaureate students, that used both online learning and high-fidelity patient simulation. Through discussions with instructors and peers, as well as personal reflection, students gained insight into both their sound and faulty critical thinking and clinical decisions.

%X Introduction: Medicine connected takes an important place in daily life and medical practice and the care of patients, especially in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: Our aim was to study the impact of the web-based personal record MSdialog® medical device on the exercise of inhealth professionals practice and measure its contribution to patient care, during in consultation or in therapeutic patient education session in France. Patients and methods: This is an observational qualitative study. A survey was sent to a health care professionals group using MSdialog® in the monitoring of patients treated with interferon beta-1a subcutaneously with Rebismart2® injector. These health care professionals were asked to provide their opinion on the platform and its tools since its launch in France. Results: Surveys concerning MSdialog® were sent to 10 neurologists (hospital and private practice-based), 12 nurses and 3 health managers, all specialized in therapeutic patient education. The surveys showed that MSdialog® has a positive effect (95%), with assistance in consultation (90%) and a better involvement of patients (91%), without increasing consultation time (62%). Adherence to treatment was recorded in 75% of users. The most used health surveys available on MSdialog® are those assessing the mood, fatigue and quality of life. Discussion: The use of the MSdialog® platform allows better recording of treatment adhesion. It also provides a deeper evaluation of patients through the proposed health questionnaires as fatigue, pain and quality of life. This platform could eventually be opened to all MS patients and include other aspects such as cognitive activities, developing currently on Msdialog®. Conclusion: MSdialog® is a new virtual medical approach. It allows health care professionals to perform support for MS patients in the follow-up, adhesion monitoring and in the evolution of chosen qualitative scales.

%X Nurse educators are incorporating computerized patient simulators into curricula with increasing frequency. Although several studies have focused on implementation and a framework for designing simulation using patient simulation, discussion of pre-training planning for simulation is limited. This article highlights some of the seminal literature from the science of training and discusses principles most applicable to nursing education. A key principle that is critical to successful training is the pre-training analysis. A framework and checklist were derived from the training literature review and are proposed to assist nurse educators in performing a pre-training analysis when planning simulation activities. This analysis will help educators define the knowledge, skills, and attitudes appropriate for the simulation experience. The tools are intended to complement existing strategies for planning simulations to provide a more comprehensive approach to simulation, resulting in a targeted and effective use of the teaching strategy.

%X Simulation techniques such as virtual patients (VPs) are valuable tools for teaching and learning a range of clinical proficiencies. Compared with other forms of simulation, however, the reported use of VPs within nursing is limited. Descriptions of simple, low cost methods for the development of VP devices could help facilitate their wider implementation and use in nursing education and training. In order to encourage broader use of VP technologies within nursing, this paper aims to expand current knowledge of VP creation by reference to the development of two virtual mental health patients produced for a multilingual e-learning course for European mental health nurses. Focusing on narrative VPs, the paper provides a brief overview of various types and potential uses of VP techniques, along with central elements of good practice in VP development. The five phase development framework used in the creation of the two VPs is presented. Processes detailed include the design and construction of case scenarios and multimedia components, in addition to initial usability and validity testing. VPs like those described here are a relatively inexpensive way of integrating virtual simulation technology into nursing education, particularly within online, blended and/or cross-cultural learning environments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X This paper discusses the use of simulation in nursing education and training, including potential benefits and barriers associated with its use. In particular, it addresses the hitherto scant application of diverse simulation devices and dedicated simulation scenarios in psychiatric and mental health nursing. It goes on to describe a low-cost, narrative-based virtual patient simulation technique which has the potential for wide application within health and social care education. An example of the implementation of this technology in a web-based pilot course for acute mental health nurses is given. This particular virtual patient technique is a simulation type ideally suited to promoting essential mental health nursing skills such as critical thinking, communication and decision making. Furthermore, it is argued that it is particularly amenable to e-learning and blended learning environments, as well as being an apt tool where multilingual simulations are required. The continued development, implementation and evaluation of narrative virtual patient simulations across a variety of health and social care programmes would help ascertain their success as an educational tool. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of virtual reality distraction on pain among patients with a hand injury undergoing a dressing change. BACKGROUND: Virtual reality distraction can effectively alleviate pain among patients undergoing a dressing change. Clinical research has not addressed pain control during a dressing change. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial was performed. METHODS: In the first dressing change sequence, 98 patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 49 cases in each group. Pain levels were compared between the two groups before and after the dressing change using a visual analog scale. The sense of involvement in virtual environments was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis, which determined the relationship between the sense of involvement and pain level. RESULTS: The difference in visual analog scale scores between the two groups before the dressing change was not statistically significant (t = 0·196, p > 0·05), but the scores became statistically significant after the dressing change (t = -30·792, p < 0·01). The correlation between the sense of involvement in a virtual environment and pain level during the dressing was statistically significant (R(2) = 0·5538, p < 0·05). CONCLUSION: Virtual reality distraction can effectively alleviate pain among patients with a hand injury undergoing a dressing change. Better results can be obtained by increasing the sense of involvement in a virtual environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Virtual reality distraction can effectively relieve pain without side effects and is not reliant on a doctor's prescription. This tool is convenient for nurses to use, especially when analgesics are unavailable.

%X Background: The WMPRS is based in the United Kingdom. Hosted by Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) in collaboration with University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust (UHNS), it was launched in September 2009. WMPRS coordinates approximately 1000 referrals annually for West Midlands children who may require transportation from their local hospital to Paediatric Intensive Care (PIC). WMPRS provides a single referral point 24 hours per day. A core team of four senior nurses were employed during June 2009 to establish the retrieval service. Aim: WMPRS needed to complete a 24 hour team with rotational nurses from BCH and UHNS PICs. Governance, financial, human resource and contractual requirements between BCH and UHNS had to be approved, and the nurses needed to be prepared to work on a new type of retrieval service. Results: Negotiations between BCH and UHNS began in June 2009. A three year Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the supply of 2 senior UHNS PIC Nurses was signed in October 2009. The SLA formed a firm contractual platform upon which to reliably ensure that retrieval nurses from UHNS were part of WMPRS from the beginning. Staff from both PICUs completed a standardized nursing induction package upon beginning their rotation. Similar arrangements were established internally between WMPRS and BCH PICU. Implication: The establishment of a rotational nursing team arises from the contractual SLA and requirement for all nurses to complete standardised induction. The core nursing team directed the rotational team to competence and independent practice, completing the workforce in only 7 weeks.

%X Although diseases of the lymphatic vessels have a high incidence, their physiopathological background has been quite neglected and only a relatively small number of medical professionals is dedicated to them. Doctors wishing to specialise in Lymphology are confronted with the scarce and irregular offer of postgraduate training. Additionally, professional associations of physicians in the European Union do not recognise the medical specialisation in Lymphology as a possible component of the official postgraduate curriculum. However, some of the most important innovations in the field of Lymphology originated in Europe. In almost every European country societies exist, that promote Lymphology among clinical doctors, researchers, physiotherapists and nurses. Patients are often organised in help groups. The Hannover Medical School is planning a virtual platform to provide e-learning in Lymphology. Only if all professionals dealing with lymphedema patients, as well as lymphedema patient associations, join efforts in awareness raising will it be possible to interest other medical professionals and be recognised by professional associations. This can be the first step into passing knowledge to new coming generations, improve the interest in Lymphology research and providing excellent care on a broad geographical basis to the millions of patients suffering from lymphedema. This initiative will be financed by the European Union through the Erasmus Lifelong Learning Programme (PoLyEurope). Suggestions and participation are most welcome.

Multiple studies have shown that not only do MDRs reduce communication errors but they also lead to improved patient outcomes including the reduction of hospital length of stay, the prevention of infections, and the reduction of ventilator time. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rounds in an academic teaching institution and gain an understanding of the obstacles faced by those participating in them. Hypothesis: While most will uniformly agree that having multidisciplinary rounds will improve patient care, we hypothesized that there are numerous pitfalls and challenges of this method as it relates to an academic training center. Methods: In our institution, a survey of forty individuals, including nurses, residents, and fellows (at various shifts) was performed in an effort to obtain a candid perspective of the current MDR practices in our ICU. Results: Through statistical analysis,there were several areas that were identified as common shortcomings of MDRs in an academic teaching institution. The majority of participants identified at least one or more problematic areas with our current multidisciplinary rounding system. The most common areas of dissatisfaction were related to team size, teaching, time constraints, and the number of interruptions.Additionally, through observing rounds for a few days, it was determined that on average MDRs in our academic center were interrupted once every 3.5 minutes. Conclusions: Through recognition of these challenges, it will hopefully lead to the improvement of MDRs in academia and in turn foster better clinical decison making and ultimately improve patient care and outcomes. These results have served as a platform for changing the rounding structure at our institution and will hopefully demonstrate an improvement in patient care and education through future analysis.

%X Introduction The National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA) 2012 estimated 15.3% of inpatient beds were occupied by patients with Diabetes, who on average spend longer in hospital than a patient without Diabetes, despite both being admitted for the same indication. Complications arise from incorrect or delayed timing of pre-prandial Insulin. All rapid and intermediate acting Insulin's have a specific timeframe in which they should be taken prior to a meal to optimize glycaemic control. The timeframe is set by the manufacturers and stipulated in the summary of product characteristics. The National Patient Safety Alert (NPSA)1 recommends systems are in place to enable hospital inpatients to self- administer Insulin where feasible and safe. Methods The sample was obtained from 29 medical wards at a regional university hospital between 12-19th November. Within each ward, patients with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 Diabetes were identified using the inpatient list and confirmed by the presence of a Think Glucose Sticker in the patient notes.Wards in which patients were admitted for 24 hours or longer were sampled. Patients over 18, deemed competent to understand and retain the purpose of the audit and who were able to consent to participation were included. Initially 70 inpatients were identified, however after excluding non-insulin dependant patients and those with impaired cognitive function and incompletely filled questionnaires the final sample size consisted of 29. Eligible patients were requested to record the exact time of their meal and when they received their Insulin in a data collection questionnaire over a 24 hour period. The questionnaire also requested patients to document their preference to who administers their insulin. Results Eighty-seven meal times were analysed, from a sample of 29 patients each recording three meals a day. 41% of patients had their Insulin administered by a nurse during their hospital stay, whilst 59% self- administered Insulin. For 49 (56%) meals, the timing of insulin administration failed to meet the audit standard; to ensure patients received Insulin within the manufacturers recommended start time prior to a meal. The average delay in administration was 10 minutes after the manufacturers recommended time, however by 30 minutes, all sampled patients had received their Insulin. Nurses were accountable for 62% of meals administered outside the recommended time, and patients responsible for 53%. 79% of patients preferred to selfadminister whilst in hospital. Discussion Findings show a poor adherence in administering Insulin within the manufacturers SPC recommend times. However patients who self-administered showed greater adherence to meeting the standard, compared with nurse led Insulin administration. Of note, the audit did not account for observer bias from patients completing the questionnaires as part of Hawthorne Effect. Results show a clear inclination towards selfmedicating, however majority of patients were frustrated at being unable to freely access their Insulin prior to meals, and being dependent on scheduled medication ward rounds before receiving their Insulin dose. There is debate as to whether delayed insulin administration has an adverse effect on a patient's health. All health-professionals that prescribe, handle or administer insulin must now complete a mandatory NHS Diabetes E-learning module on the safe use of Insulin. Further research would be required to prove its effectiveness and positive impact on patient outcomes.

%X Objective: To provide evidence regarding existing partnerships between academic pharmacy and primary care that focus on training practitioners in patient-centered health care (PCHC). Data sources: The report of the 2009-10 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Professional Affairs Committee identified 25 current U.S.-based examples of PCHC that incorporate the training and preparation of both student pharmacists and pharmacy residents. Summary: The most frequently reported health care delivery model was an ambulatory care clinic followed by a Department of Veterans Affairs or military hospital clinic. Pharmacists worked alongside a variety of other health care providers in these settings. Collaboration occurred most commonly with family and internal medicine physicians but also with specialists such as psychiatrists, obstetricians/gynecologists, hematologists/oncologists, and other health care providers (e.g., nurses, physician assistants, dieticians, social workers). Conclusion: In light of the increasing demand for primary care services, pharmacists' documented ability to address these needs and the resulting benefits to patients, providers, and systems in these models, developing strategies for promoting pharmacist integration into PCHC is essential. Academic pharmacy provides a valuable platform for this integration through its expert faculty clinician involvement in care and practice-based research and student pharmacist and pharmacy residency training.

%X Interprofessional collaboration is vital to the delivery of quality care in long-term care settings; however, caregivers in long-term care face barriers to participating in training programs to improve collaborative practices. Consequently, eLearning can be used to create an environment that combines convenient, individual learning with collaborative experiential learning. Findings of this study revealed that learners enjoyed the flexibility of the Working Together learning resource. They acquired new knowledge and skills that they were able to use in their practice setting to achieve higher levels of collaborative practice. Nurses were identified as team leaders because of their pivotal role in the long-term care home and collaboration with all patient care providers. Nurses are ideal as knowledge brokers for the collaborative practice team. Quantitative findings showed no change in learner's attitudes regarding collaborative practice; however, interviews provided examples of positive changes experienced. Face-to-face collaboration was found to be a challenge, and changes to organizations, systems, and technology need to be made to facilitate this process. The Working Together learning resource is an important first step toward strengthening collaboration in long-term care, and the pilot implementation provides insights that further our understanding of both interprofessional collaboration and effective eLearning.

%X Context The quality improvement project was undertaken at a District General Hospital and included staff who care for seriously sick or injured children including doctors and nurses working in general paediatrics, accident and emergency and anaesthetics. The appropriate initial assessment and resuscitation of serious ill and injured children together with on-going reassessment and emergency management are essential for reducing morbidity and mortality. Problem There was no integrated multi-disciplinary team (MDT) paediatric resuscitation training and several paediatric serious incidents had involved more than one department. Simulation training increases the acquisition of skills and provides a platform to review performance and make errors without compromising patient safety. Both the Department of Health and RCPCH recognise the importance of simulation training in improving patient safety through reducing human and system errors. High fidelity manikins can be monitored which significantly adds to their realism. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes A retrospective review was undertaken by a paediatric trainee of all the paediatric serious incidents during a ten year period to identify common themes and key recommendations. The development of MDT resuscitation training was one of the principle recommendations to improve the emergency assessment and care provided to children. Intervention MDT paediatric resuscitation training sessions involving healthcare assistants, nurses, doctors and other allied healthcare professionals from general paediatrics, accident and emergency and anaesthetics were planned several months in advance through a consultation process. Dates and times were chosen to maximise trainee availability and minimise disruption to routine services. For MDT training in accident and emergency, strategies were implemented to ensure patient safety at all times. Resuscitation officers provided support and resuscitation equipment. The hospital switch board was notified so a simulated paediatric crash call could be initiated through the hospital paging system. Scenarios were developed based upon previous paediatric serious incidents to review whether key recommendations had been successfully implemented and sustained. The focus was on familiarisation with paediatric resuscitation equipment, drugs and guidelines in real time as well as teamwork, communication and leadership skills and dynamics between and within the different specialties. A pilot paediatric simulation MDT training session was also undertaken in the Education Centre. Strategy for change MDT paediatric resuscitation training was coordinated through the paediatric and emergency departments as well as the hospital resuscitation committee. Anonymous feedback through questionnaires was collected from participants. Measurement of improvement The MDT paediatric resuscitation and simulation training received very positive feedback: “Excellent scenario, felt more real than other simulated scenarios I have attended.” Participants found the MDT simulation training much more realistic than weekly departmental resuscitation training with 79% strongly recommending the simulation training compared with just 33% for the weekly departmental training. Effects of changes MDT paediatric resuscitation training was successfully implemented. A business case was developed for the purchase of a paediatric simulation manikin to improve the reality of the training. Lessons learnt MDT paediatric resuscitation training is a very valuable tool for improving teamwork and paediatric resuscitation skills. Paediatric high fidelity simulation training can enhance this further through providing a more realistic experience. Message for others MDT resuscitation training should be routine practice in district general hospitals. Basing scenarios on previous serious incidents is a useful way to review previous key recommendations. A business case can be developed by demonstrating improved experience through a pilot high fidelity simulation trainer.

%X Introduction: In 2014 the BMT and haematology units at the University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust combined and a new purpose built ward was created to care for all haematology and transplant patients. It was identified at a very early point in the amalgamation that the BMT nurses and the haematology nurses each had their own individual nursing skills and knowledge base. The challenge would be to ensure all the nurses on the unit had appropriate access to education so that the BMT nurses were competent and felt safe and skilled in caring for haematology patients and the haematology nurses were appropriately trained to care for transplant patients. The Haematology Clinical Nurses Specialists and Education Sister decided that a Journal club, alongside formal education sessions, would be an effective learning tool to assist in providing up to date, quality education to a large group of nurses with a variety of clinical skills and experience. Method: The literature recognises that a journal club facilitates discussion and evaluation of new research and considers the application to practice and improvement in patient care. The advantages of using a journal club are that members of the group can update knowledge, learn to evaluate the strength of the evidence, promote implementation of new knowledge into practice and improve patient outcomes. With over registered 50 nurses to include within the education sessions, a formal meeting would not be practical and so the idea of an E- Journal Club was formulated. The essence of the E- Journal club was that relevant journal articles would be emailed to all members of the group and discussions on the articles would be held via an on line platform as well as at weekly, informal ward based sessions. Results: The initial E- Journal club was for all staff nurses on the ward. A review of the programme using staff feedback was undertaken 4 months later and the E-Journal club was reported to be a useful, interactive and educational resource. The feedback also identified that the health care assistants were also keen to be involved in the E- Journal club and had their own educational needs. At this point the E- Journal club was extended to include all members of staff on the haematology and transplant unit. Conclusion: The E-Journal club has shown to be an effective and useful educational tool for informing, updating and facilitating learning for staff nurses and health care assistants on a busy haematology and BMT unit. The E- Journal club has prompted discussion about nursing change, reacted in a timely manner to ward nursing issues and been a wellreceived resource to deliver effective and appropriate education.

%X Aim: The aim of the thesis Portraying hope among women with newly diagnosed gynaecological cancer is to examine hope experienced the day the woman get diagnosed with cancer. Hope is also closely linked to hopelessness, and the day you get a cancer diagnose can be a day of emotional chaos and a feeling that one has lost control over life. The feeling of hopelessness can easily appear. However, precisely because hope is a part of life, hope is present, in one form or another. Background: Helping a patient to find hope in illness and suffering is one of the cornerstones of humanistic-oriented nursing where also dignity, respect, integrity and caring are overarching values. Knowledge of how patients themselves feel hope at the time of diagnosis will enhance the nursing knowledge base and will increase understanding and opportunities for clinical nurses. Cancer is a common and often life-threatening disease and also the word cancer have a stigmatizing meaning. Gynaecological cancer is one of the most frequent cancers among women. Methods: This qualitative study was carrying out at a surgical unit at a Danish University Hospital, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of hope. The data collection is based both on interviews and drawings. Fifteen women, all diagnosed with gynaecological cancer, were interviewed the same day they received their diagnosis. Semistructured interviews were chosen in order to investigate the informants lived experiences of hope. Data was analyzed using a phenomenological and a visual approach. Results: In this thesis hope as collected in a synthesis showing three sides, an internal, an external and a commotional force are belonging together, and where hopelessness is seen as a dark shadow in a circumference of the triangle shaped design. The findings discovered of the close relationship between hope and hopelessness supports the need for nurses and other health care to supports patients find hope starting from time of diagnosis. Perspective and Implication: New in this study is to use interviews and drawings in combination and that hoped stimulated by external force loaded from the nature. Drawings and conversations about the drawings gave a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of “experience of hope.” This study, which creates new knowledge about patients' experiences of hope in general and describes hope in newly diagnosed gynaecological cancer, are importance for clinical nursing practices. The results may create a platform for discussion between nurses and compared with their own experiences. Perhaps crayons and drawing paper could be included as standard in clinical nursing practices when interview with patients about hope or other existential topics are actual. A combination of interview and drawing could have a therapeutic and explanatory of those involved. Hope could give life force - whether the patient has newly diagnosed or otherwise in need of support and nursing care.

%X Introduction and Objectives National audits show oxygen prescribing is still not consistently safe and appropriate, despite the 2008 BTS Emergency Oxygen Guidelines. The aim of this study was to assess whether medical students taking Final MBBS examinations are able to prescribe oxygen safely and appropriately. Methods A 2012 medical school Final MBBS Objective Structured Clinical Examination station assessed oxygen prescribing. Candidates were presented with one of two clinical scenarios requiring an oxygen prescription on a drug chart; Scenario 1: 72-year-old patient with COPD, and Scenario 2: 72-year-old hypoxic patient without respiratory disease. Prescriptions from 227 out of 363 students taking MBBS were retrospectively assessed against BTS standards using the criteria; correct target saturation range, oxygen flow, device and frequency of delivery. The remaining prescriptions were not available for analysis. Prescriptions were classified as 'safe/unsafe' and 'perfect (met all standards)/imperfect' by a respiratory nurse specialist. Results 66/122 (54%) of candidates wrote the correct saturation range for the COPD scenario, compared with 42/105 (40%) for scenario 2. Oxygen flows were correct in 74/122 (60.6%) of COPD and 4/105 (3.8%) of scenario 2 prescriptions. The flow was appropriate for the device in 91.2% (207/227) and prescriptions specified 'continuous' oxygen in 60.8% (138/227). 59/122 (48.4%) prescriptions for COPD were safe and 26/122 (21.3%) 'perfect' compared with 19/105 (18.1%) safe and 0/105 (0%) perfect prescriptions for the hypoxic patient without respiratory disease. 185/363 (51%) students passed this station with overall year pass rate for finals 96% (349/363). Conclusions This study demonstrates an important unmet need in undergraduate education as competence in, and safety of, oxygen prescribing by otherwise successful MBBS candidates was poor. Of the prescriptions available for analysis, only half used appropriate target saturations. Half of prescriptions for COPD scenario were safe but only one in five met all BTS standards. No prescriptions for hypoxia without respiratory disease met all standards and one in five was safe. We believe that this reflects the undergraduate teaching focus on oxygen in COPD. We recommend introducing a compulsory undergraduate e-learning module on oxygen delivery and prescribing as newly-qualified doctors need to be able to prescribe oxygen safely.

%X Introduction and Objectives National audits show oxygen prescribing is not consistently safe, despite BTS Emergency Oxygen Guidelines. We previouslyidentified that medical students were unable to safely prescribe oxygen at final MBBS examinations.1 A compulsory e-Learning module was introduced to address this unmet educational need. We assessed the impact of this intervention in 2013. Methods An Oxygen Prescribing Final MBBS OSCE station was used in 2012 and 2013. In 2013 candidates (350) completed a new compulsory oxygen e-Learning module. Candidates in 2012 (227) had not. In 2013 the exam prescription chart also included an oxygen prescription section. Each year, candidates were presented with one of two clinical scenarios. Scenario 1: 72-year-old patient with COPD, and Scenario 2: 72-year-old hypoxic patient without respiratory disease. Oxygen prescriptions were assessed against BTS standards across a number of domains. They were classified as 'safe/unsafe' and 'perfect/imperfect' by a respiratory nurse specialist. Results Some improvements were seen in both scenarios (See Table 1), particularly prescription of the correct target saturation range. In 2012 40% (42/105) prescribed correct range for the non-COPD scenario; in 2013 this was 98% (154/156). Conclusions Introducing an oxygen e-Learning module and BTS-recommended oxygen prescription section resulted in improved competence and safety of oxygen prescribing with significant improvement in correct target saturation ranges. However, students still have gaps in equipment knowledge and a high proportion did not prescribe oxygen safely for a patient without respiratory disease. The e-Learning module was undertaken by students at a point close to examinations; moving this earlier in the year may lead to better engagement and improve the understanding of oxygen prescribing in non-COPD patients, emphasised in the module. Safer prescribing is enabled by oxygen prescription sections with target range saturation choices but equipment education is also needed. Adverse consequences of incorrect oxygen use continue to cause patients harm. Ensuring undergraduates have the practical knowledge and skills to prescribe oxygen safely is essential.

%X NICE guidelines emphasise the need for a confident, early diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ Myalgic Encephalitis (CFS/ME) in Primary Care with management tailored to the needs of the patient. Research suggests that GPs are reluctant to make the diagnosis and resources for management are currently inadequate. This study aimed to develop resources for practitioners and patients to support the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME in primary care. Semi structured interviews were conducted with patients, carers, GPs, practice nurses and CFS/ME specialists in North West England. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed qualitatively using open explorative thematic coding. Two patient involvement groups were consulted at each stage of the development of resources to ensure that the resources reflect everyday issues faced by people living with CFS/ME. Patients and carers stressed the importance of recognising CFS/ME as a legitimate condition, and the need to be believed by health care professionals. GPs and practice nurses stated that they do not always have the knowledge or skills to diagnose and manage the condition. They expressed a preference for an online training package. For patients, information on getting the most out of a consultation and the role of carers was thought to be important. Patients did not want to be overloaded with information at diagnosis, and suggested information should be given in steps. A DVD was suggested, to enable information sharing with carers and family, and also for those whose symptoms act as a barrier to reading. Rather than use a top-down approach to the development of training for health care practitioners and information for patients and carers, we have used data from key stakeholders to develop a patient DVD, patient leaflets to guide symptom management and a modular e-learning resource which should equip GPs to diagnose and manage CFS/ME effectively, meet NICE guidelines and give patients acceptable, evidence-based information.

%X Management of the critical patient in the undergraduate teaching of medicine is an important part of first aid, intensive care medicine and anaesthesiology. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of the interactive learning opportunities which are offered to students at the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University (MF MU): the use of the virtual patient (interactive algorithms, clinical scenarios), the standardised patient, skills training on patient models, simulators with an embedded computer model or videoconference streaming from operating theatres. These teaching methods have become part of undergraduate teaching of medicine, dentistry and nursing. Since the year 2007, 43 interactive learning algorithms have been created at MF MU in the Czech-English version. The process of creation takes two semesters and is performed by groups of 2-3 students of medicine under the supervision of a physician. The created algorithm is in the form of a Flash object freely accessible online through the AKUTNE.CZ portal (www.akutne.eu). The clinical scenarios represent real cases of patients with severe sepsis hospitalized on ICUs participating in EPOSS (eposs.registry.cz; Data-based evaluation and prediction of outcome in severe sepsis). Videoconference streaming from operating theatres to teaching rooms enables a large number of students to watch a rare surgical procedure without entering the operating theatre. Advanced patient simulator by CAE Healthcare® has been used for four years at MF MU to practice team leadership and communication skills in the subjects of first aid, intensive care medicine and emergency medicine. We present an overview of methods that can enrich undergraduate education of acute medicine, along with instructions for their implementation into the curriculum.

%X The quest for a standardized terminology that can meet the varying needs of healthcare practice, and requirements for secondary use, is ongoing. The number of potential users and the number of potential uses for standardized terminologies make collaborative development, rather than the traditional de jure approach, an imperative, and there appears to be significant worldwide interest in this area. In this article we describe an initiative of the International Council of Nurses (ICN), ICNP C-Space (Collaborative Space), which utilized a social media platform to encourage and facilitate global collaborative development of its terminology, the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP(®)). We report on several years of experience of managing the platform and provide valuable lessons on collaborative terminology development. Our experience suggests that web-based platforms such as ICNP C-Space certainly offer the promise of a broader, wider-reaching, and more inclusive community of contributors to the terminology development process. However, there are also potential limitations for which we provide practical recommendations.

%X Introduction: The sElf management anD support proGrammE (EDGE) project, will test the efficacy of a multi-component mobile health (mHealth) intervention in improving quality of life in COPD patients. An internet-linked tablet computing device has been developed intended for use by people with varying computer skills, ensuring data quality and integrated within clinical care to deliver self-management support. We report the results of 6 month cohort study in which the acceptability and feasibility of the platform was examined. Methods: 23 patients (diagnosis of COPD, > 40 years of age, MRC dyspnoea scale ≥ 2, smoking history > 10 pack years) used the mHealth system to keep a daily symptom diary (questions including general well-being, cough, breathlessness, sputum quantity and colour) and use of medications. A thirty second period of data transmission from a pulse-oximeter allowed daily collection of pulse rate and oxygen saturation data. Additional self-management support was provided via software modules: (i) personalised self-management plans (ii) brief-video clips with educational advice on managing COPD and treatments (including medicines use, inhaler technique, physical activity and mood management) (iii) brief messages from patient's respiratory nurse. Results: Of 23 participants consented, 18 patients (10 men, age range of 50- 85 years) completed 6 months follow-up and were included in the analysis. On baseline questioning all had different levels of computer skills. 78% of participants completed their diaries and measured their oximetry on at least 5 days/week. Participants completed daily symptom score and medication use diaries, and took oximetry readings on an average of 77% of trial days (range 40-98%). 16 patients accessed video clips (mean 3.89 times, range 0-11). All 14 video clips were accessed (mean 8.5 times, range 1-12): the most popular video was “How to use an MDI inhaler” . Video clips about inhaler technique, exercise and pulmonary rehabilitation and mood management were watched a similar number of times (means of 4.7, 5.8 and 3.7 times respectively). Self-management plans were accessed by all patients (mean 9.78 times, range 3-40). 17 patients accessed messages from respiratory nurses (mean 29.7 times, range 0-169). Conclusion: These findings confirm that daily use of the mHealth platform is feasible and acceptable to people with COPD to report daily symptoms and medicines use, and to measure simple physical parameters such as pulse oximetry. In addition, features to support self-management such as video clips, self-management plans and respiratory nursing messaging were accessed by the majority of patients.

%X Background: UK public health policy strongly advocates dietary change for the improvement of population health and emphasises the importance of individual empowerment to improve health. A new and evolving area in the promotion of dietary behavioural change is 'e-learning', the use of interactive electronic media to facilitate teaching and learning on a range of issues including health. The high level of accessibility, combined with emerging advances in computer processing power, data transmission and data storage, makes interactive e-learning a potentially powerful and cost-effective medium for improving dietary behaviour. Objective: This review aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adaptive e-learning interventions for dietary behaviour change, and also to explore potential psychological mechanisms of action and components of effective interventions. Data sources: Electronic bibliographic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Center, Global Health, Health Economic Evaluations Database, Health Management Information Consortium, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science) were searched for the period January 1990 to November 2009. Reference lists of included studies and previous reviews were also screened; authors were contacted and trial registers were searched. Review methods: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials, involving participants aged ≥ 13 years, which evaluated the effectiveness of interactive software programs for improving dietary behaviour. Primary outcomes were measures of dietary behaviours, including estimated intakes or changes in intake of energy, nutrients, dietary fibre, foods or food groups. Secondary outcome measures were clinical outcomes such as anthropometry or blood biochemistry. Psychological mediators of dietary behaviour change were also investigated. Two review authors independently screened results and extracted data from included studies, with any discrepancies settled by a third author. Where studies reported the same outcome, the results were pooled using a random-effects model, with weighted mean differences (WMDs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in two ways: through a systematic literature review and by building a de novo decision model to assess the costeffectiveness of a 'generic' e-learning device compared with dietary advice delivered by a health-care professional. Results: A total of 36,379 titles were initially identified by the electronic searches, of which 43 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. All e-learning interventions were delivered in high-income countries. The most commonly used behavioural change techniques reported to have been used were goal setting; feedback on performance; information on consequences of behaviour in general; barrier identification/problem solving; prompting self-monitoring of behaviour; and instruction on how to perform the behaviour. There was substantial heterogeneity in the estimates of effect. E-learning interventions were associated with a WMD of +0.24 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.44) servings of fruit and vegetables per day; -0.78 g (95% CI -2.5 g to 0.95 g) total fat consumed per day; -0.24 g (95% CI -1.44 g to 0.96 g) saturated fat intake per day; -1.4% (95% CI -2.5% to -0.3%) of total energy consumed from fat per day; +1.45 g (95% CI -0.02 g to 2.92 g) dietary fibre per day; +4 kcal (95% CI -85 kcal to 93 kcal) daily energy intake; -0.1 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.7 kg/m2 to 0.4 kg/m2) change in body mass index. The base-case results from the E-Learning Economic Evaluation Model suggested that the incremental costeffectiveness ratio was approximately £102,112 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis showed that although the individuallevel EVPI was arguably negligible, the population-level value was between £37M and £170M at a willingness to pay of £20,000-30,000 per additional QA Y. Limitations: The limitations of this review include potential reporting bias, incomplete retrieval of completed research studies and data extraction errors. Conclusion: The current clinical and economic evidence base suggests that e-learning devices designed to promote dietary behaviour change will not produce clinically significant changes in dietary behaviour and are at least as expensive as other individual behaviour change interventions. Future work recommendations: Despite the relatively high EVPI results from the costeffectiveness modelling, further clinical trials of individual e-learning interventions should not be undertaken until theoretically informed work that addresses the question of which characteristics of the target population, target behaviour, content and delivery of the intervention are likely to lead to positive results, is completed.

%X Health care constraints make it essential that nurse practitioner (NP) roles utilize knowledge, skill and judgment to full capacity. The clinical NP role is clearly defined by medical directives however, a practice framework is not well established for the non-clinical elements. This quality initiative describes the non-clinical NP role, beyond direct patient care, providing patient and staff education, practice guidelines, program development, research, professional education, presentations and publications. Forty-six NPs completed an electronic questionnaire describing non clinical activities over a one year period at a tertiary care facility. An 83% return rate found that ninety percent had greater than 10 years of direct nursing experience with 88% having both direct nursing experience and a specialized professional membership(s), including attendance at conferences enhancing clinical practice. NPs contributed excellence through knowledge dissemination via lectures, authoring of staff self learning packages, and e-learning projects amplifying best practice guidelines. The survey highlighted the expertise and leadership is essential to the NP role, which includes clinical teaching for undergraduate/graduate nursing students utilizing mentorship/preceptorship models. Committee involvement at unit and corporate levels; professional practice and contributing to evidence based research abstracts, publications and presentations at nursing/medical conferences. Non-clinical aspects of the NP role demonstrates the benefit of the leadership skills of the NP role within the health care team and the potential impact on hospital strategic planning.

%X Introduction: The Yellow Card Scheme (YCS) is one of the most recognised spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting schemes worldwide and is an important means of monitoring drug safety in clinical practice to ensure that all medicines are acceptably safe, The evaluation of ADR reports identifies populations for which the MHRA can focus its strategy to strengthen direct reporting amongst specific reporter groups. Spontaneous suspected ADRs are reported directly on a voluntary basis by Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and as of 2005 by patients via the Scheme. In 2008, an enhanced version of the Yellow Card web form was launched in to facilitate reporting with different forms for healthcare professionals and patients. The website was further updated in 2012 to provide an enhanced platform, supporting the requirements of the new pharmacovigilance legislation. Aim: To analyse ADR data and identify areas to focus the Yellow Card strategy to strengthen reporting within the UK. Method: We performed an analysis of spontaneous ADR reports received by the MHRA from 2010 to 2014. All drugs were analysed by active substance using the MHRA's drug dictionary and suspected ADRs were classified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory affairs (MedDRA). Results: 2014 has seen a 36 % increase in the number of ADR reports received compared to 2010 and a 2 % increase from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, the number of Yellow Card reports received from patients form 22 % of all reports directly received by the MHRA whilst HCP reports account for 46 %.2014 has seen a 12.8 % increase in electronic reporting compared to 2013 and electronic patient reports have increased from 73 % in 2010 to 88 % in 2014 whilst electronic HCP reporting increased from 38 % in 2010 to 79 %. The largest proportion of reports was received from GPs (28 %) and the number of reports from nurses fluctuated during 2010-2014 due to various vaccination campaigns. Conclusion: The data highlights the importance of both regular targeted promotional activities to raise awareness of the Yellow Card Scheme, and making ADR reporting as quick, easy and accessible as possible. Continued engagement with HCPs and patients is key to maintaining the success of schemes such as the YCS as well as effective monitoring and communication of drug safety issues.

%X New and improved teaching strategies are required to engage students in meaningful coursework to enhance critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. Advanced practice nurses are responsible for producing creative and realistic health promotion and disease prevention proposals, which have the potential for implementation as part of a course requirement. Unfortunately, these proposals often lack the sophistication and critical literacy necessary to effectively communicate the student's knowledge and understanding of their ideas. Infusing critical thinking and critical literacy into all curricula is one of the stated goals of the university-wide "Enhancing Critical Literacy Project." This learning-centered program serves as the platform for this article and the early adoption of selected student assessment techniques. Concepts presented as part of a critical literacy enhancement seminar provides the theoretical underpinning of this approach and is designed to encourage student innovation through creative writing. A detailed description of the various strategies and their implementation are discussed.

%X Background: Simulation is attractive for its potential for applying a control over learning environment, content complexity, teacher time, costs and risk. Simulation-based instruction (SBI) is poised to expand in pharmacy practice and education. This systematic review synthesises published, SBI in first-degree pharmacy programmes, especially those pertaining to psychomotor or cognitive skill development. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and some education journals were searched for relevant articles published between January 2000 and December 2015. Results: Of 108 articles identified, 12 were included, which were covering four major simulation-based interventions. These simulation-based interventions were diverse, and they covered a range of competencies and outcome measures. Nine studies included medication, and five studies included physical examination/procedure-related competencies as outcome measures. The evidence from nine studies suggested that skills could be improved through interventions involving human patient simulation. Conclusion: Despite improvements in students' ability to perform, there is a lack of evidence on how this translates to real settings and to patient satisfaction.

%X Increasingly, high-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) is becoming essential to nursing education. Much remains unknown about how classroom learning is connected to student decision-making in simulation scenarios and the degree to which transference takes place between the classroom setting and actual practice. The present study was part of a larger pilot study aimed at determining the relationship between nursing students' clinical ability to prioritize their actions and the associated cognitions and physiologic outcomes of care using HFPS. In an effort to better explain the knowledge base being used by nursing students in HFPS, the investigators explored the relationship between common measures of knowledge and performance-related variables. Findings are discussed within the context of the expert performance approach and concepts from cognitive psychology, such as cognitive architecture, cognitive load, memory, and transference.

%X An evaluation was conducted of perceptions of practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) toward use of simulation for initial certification, continuing education, and recertification. The hypothesis was that a 1-day simulation experience would improve their perceptions toward simulation use. The first phase developed content-valid questions to examine CRNAs' perceptions toward simulation. The second phase used these questions to survey practicing CRNAs in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. During the third phase, 9 CRNAs were selected to complete a 1-day simulation experience and complete the perception questionnaire before and after theexperience. Through content validity index calculations, 25 of 27 questions were retained for use in this study. A total of 378 CRNAs responded to the questionnaire. There was consensus that human patient simulation (HPS) is an important part of anesthesia provider training, and 85.7% strongly agreed, agreed, or somewhat agreed that HPS should be a required component for initial certification. Additionally, 52.9% of respondents agreed (somewhat agreed or strongly agreed) that continuing education units from HPS should be required for recertification. After the simulation, a significant (P < .05) positive change in level of agreement was noted for 13 of 25 questions, including questions related to initial training and recertification.

%X Introduction: Meeting the learner's needs during an Advanced Burn Life Support (ABLS) Provider Course directs healthcare institutions to embrace new learning environments, clinical models and educational practices that replicate real-life clinical situations. We enhanced current ABLS simulated scenarios to include high fidelity human patient simulation (HFHPS) and adjuncts (e.g. radiographs, laboratory reports) which were utilized by learners, ABLS faculty and simulation center personnel. We assessed if these enhancements improved the learners understanding of the primary and secondary burn survey, improved participant's satisfaction and self-confidence in learning and promoted realism in the simulation. Methods: An evidenced-based (EB) National League for Nursing (NLN) simulation design template was used to augment the ABLS simulation syllabus. The designed template was vetted through the simulation center personnel and the faculty. To measure effectiveness of these changes the NLN Educational Practices Questionnaire (EPQ), the Simulation Design Scale (SDS), and the Student Satisfaction and Self- Confidence in Learning Scale (SSSCL) were utilized. A Likert scale was used to measure each survey question, 1=lowest and 5= highest score. Learner experience was evaluated upon ABLS course completion. Results: From Oct 2012 - Aug 2013, The NLN simulation was utilized by 71 learners who rotated thru 5 ABLS simulations during 3 courses, (n=355 experiences). Participation rate for all 3 surveys was 83% (59/71). SSSCL's overall satisfaction with learning and self confidence was 4.4±0.7 and 4.5±0.7, respectively. The EPQ survey showed active participation rating of 4.5±0.7; with an importance rating of 4.4±0.8. The SDS rating for scenario and simulation realism was 4.6±0.6 and 4.5±0.6, respectively. Overall importance of realism was rated 4.4±0.8. Standardization of ABLS content through HFHPS allowed for greater consistency among faculty. Conclusions: Use of HFHPS based on an EB simulation design augmented perceived learner satisfaction/competence, engaged active participation, and strengthened the realism of our ABLS Course. HFHPS scenarios allowed the participants to role-play, delegate tasks, share information and increase communication skills. Consistency in HFHPS scenarios allowed for repetition until content was mastered.

The discussion is partially informed by evidence from personal reflections from consultant nurses obtained from semistructured interviews undertaken as part of a pilot study aimed at explaining the influences and context of nursing leadership in mental health. The authors believe that more in depth consideration needs to be given to the interpretation and implementation of such professional policy initiatives in to mental health nursing. Further thought also needs to be given to how consultant nurses in mental health can operationalize their expert clinical practice.

%X Training emergency personnel on the clinical management of a mass-casualty incident (MCI) with prior chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear, or explosives (CBRNE) -exposed patients is a component of hospital preparedness procedures. The objective of this research was to determine whether a Virtual Emergency Department (VED), designed after the Stanford University Medical Center's Emergency Department (ED) and populated with 10 virtual patient victims who suffered from a dirty bomb blast (radiological) and 10 who suffered from exposure to a nerve toxin (chemical), is an effective clinical environment for training ED physicians and nurses for such MCIs. Ten physicians with an average of four years of post-training experience, and 12 nurses with an average of 9.5 years of post-graduate experience at Stanford University Medical Center and San Mateo County Medical Center participated in this IRB-approved study. All individuals were provided electronic information about the clinical features of patients exposed to a nerve toxin or radioactive blast before the study date and an orientation to the "game" interface, including an opportunity to practice using it immediately prior to the study. An exit questionnaire was conducted using a Likert Scale test instrument. Among these 22 trainees, two-thirds of whom had prior Code Triage (multiple casualty incident) training, and one-half had prior CBRNE training, about two-thirds felt immersed in the virtual world much or all of the time. Prior to the training, only four trainees (18%) were confident about managing CBRNE MCIs. After the training, 19 (86%) felt either "confident" or "very confident", with 13 (59%) attributing this change to practicing in the virtual ED. Twenty-one (95%) of the trainees reported that the scenarios were useful for improving healthcare team skills training, the primary objective for creating them. Eighteen trainees (82%) believed that the cases also were instructive in learning about clinical skills management of such incidents. These data suggest that training healthcare teams in online, virtual environments with dynamic virtual patients is an effective method of training for management of MCIs, particularly for uncommonly occurring incidents.

%X Background-Although disease management programs for patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) are effective, they are, however, often resource intensive, limiting their uptake. Peer support programs have led to improved outcomes among patients with other chronic conditions and may result in similar improvements for patients with HF. Methods and Results-In this randomized controlled trial, Reciprocal Peer Support (RPS) arm patients participated in a HF nurse practitioner-led goal setting group session, received brief training in peer communication skills, and were paired with another participant in their cohort with whom they were encouraged to talk weekly using a telephone platform. Participants were also encouraged to attend 3 nurse practitioner-facilitated peer support group sessions. Patients in the nurse care management arm attended a nurse practitioner-led session to address their HF care questions and receive HF educational materials and information on how to access care management services. The median age of the patients was 69 years; 51% were female and 26% were racial/ethnic minorities. Only 55% of RPS patients participated in peer calls or group sessions. In intention-to-treat analyses, the RPS and nurse care management groups did not differ in time-tofirst all-cause rehospitalization or death or in mean numbers of rehospitalizations or deaths. There were no differences in improvements in 6-month measures of HF-specific quality of life or social support. Conclusions-Among patients recently hospitalized for HF, more than half of RPS participants had no or minimal engagement with the RPS program, and the program did not improve outcomes compared with usual HF nurse care management. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

%X Background: Resource barriers complicate diabetes care management. Support from peers may help patients manage their diabetes. Objective: To compare a reciprocal peer-support (RPS) program with nurse care management (NCM). Design: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00320112) Setting: 2 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities. Patients: 244 men with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels greater than 7.5% during the previous 6 months. Measurements: The primary outcome was 6-month change in HbA1c level. Secondary outcomes were changes in insulin therapy; blood pressure; and patient reports of medication adherence, diabetes-related support, and emotional distress. Intervention: Patients in the RPS group attended an initial group session to set diabetes-related behavioral goals, receive peer communication skills training, and be paired with another age-matched peer patient. Peers were encouraged to talk weekly using a telephone platform that recorded call occurrence and provided reminders to promote peer contact. These patients could also participate in optional group sessions at 1, 3, and 6 months. Patients in the NCM group attended a 1.5-hour educational session and were assigned to a nurse care manager. Results: Of the 244 patients enrolled, 216 (89%) completed the HbA1c assessments and 231 (95%) completed the survey assessments at 6 months. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 8.02% to 7.73% (change, -0.29%) in the RPS group and increased from 7.93% to 8.22% (change, 0.29%) in the NCM group. The difference in HbA1c change between groups was 0.58% (P = 0.004). Among patients with a baseline HbA1c level greater than 8.0%, those in the RPS group had a mean decrease of 0.88%, compared with a 0.07% decrease among those in the NCM group (between-group difference, 0.81%; P < 0.001). Eight patients in the RPS group started insulin therapy, compared with 1 patient in the NCM group (P = 0.020). Groups did not differ in blood pressure, self-reported medication adherence, or diabetes-specific distress, but the RPS group reported improvement in diabetes social support. Limitation: The study included only male veterans and lasted only 6 months. Conclusion: Reciprocal peer support holds promise as a method for diabetes care management.

%X BACKGROUND: While professional self-management support delivered between standard outpatient visits can improve diabetes outcomes, many health care systems lack the resources to implement labor- and resource-intensive nurse-led case management programs. Mobilizing patients to provide reciprocal peer support to supplement and extend formal care management services is one potential means of improving diabetes clinical outcomes without unacceptable increases in staff time. To date, there have been no randomized controlled evaluations of such programs compared with nurse case management in “real-world” clinical settings. METHODS: We conducted a six-month randomized controlled effectiveness study in two Veterans' Affairs (VA) health care facilities among male diabetes patients with inadequate glycemic control (an A1c in the prior 6 months of at least 7.5%). Participants in both arms attended an initial session led by a VA nurse case manager in which their point-of-service A1c, blood pressure, and LDL values were reviewed and questions addressed. Intervention patients then participated in a group session to: help them set short-term, concrete diabetes-related behavioral change goals ('action planning'), provide them with a brief introduction to basic communication skills, and pair patients with another age-matched intervention participant in the same cohort as their 'peer partner'. Participants were encouraged to call their peer partner at least once a week to provide mutual support during the six-month program using a telephone platform that recorded call initiation, frequency, and duration. Intervention participants were also offered three optional 1.5 hour group sessions at months 1, 3, and 6. These were completely patient-driven sessions in which participants were encouraged to share concerns, questions, strategies, and discuss progress on their action plans. Control arm patients attended a baseline education session on nurse case management and were offered the services of a nurse case manager over the six-month intervention period. 244 patients were enrolled, and 216 of these completed the six-month intervention (89%). Hemoglobin A1c was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Average age of participants in both arms was 62. Participants in the intervention group had a mean A1c of 8.02% at baseline, which improved to 7.73% at six months (-0.29%). Control arm participants had on average an increase in A1c over the six months (7.93 to 8.22 [+0.29]). The difference in the change in A1c between the two groups was -0.58% (p<0.005). In stratified analyses, among patients with baseline A1c >9.0%, intervention arm participants had a mean decrease of -0.88% at six months compared with an -0.07% decrease among control participants (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Intervention participants had significantly improved A1c levels after six months compared to control participants offered usual nurse care management. Peer-based models of mutual chronic illness management support represent a promising approach for bridging service gaps, while increasing both the quality and quantitity of assistance with self-care.

%X The historical analysis of the complex and often contradictory views of Florence Nightingale regarding the rights of women is explored in this paper. Feminism and nursing are often viewed as contradictory and antithetical. The relationship between the two is examined through the link between Florence Nightingale and her contemporary, Barbara Leigh-Smith Bodichon. Leigh-Smith was founder and primary financier of The English Women's Journal that provided a public platform for the major feminist writings of the period. Its offices in Langham Place formed the administrative centre of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women. Bodichon and her colleagues were often referred to as the 'Langham Place Group'. Unexplored prior to this study was the fact that Leigh-Smith and Nightingale were first cousins. Utilizing techniques of internal and external criticism, primary and secondary sources were surveyed relating to Nightingale and Leigh-Smith. The views of both women on the subjects of the rights of women, women's suffrage, the employment status of women, and the societal place of women are compared and contrasted. The legacy of both Leigh-Smith and Nightingale to twentieth century feminism, the status of women, and the profession of nursing is then elaborated. The exploration of the views of both Nightingale and Leigh-Smith is important to gain a clearer understanding of the existing relationship between nursing and feminism. In keeping with the aims of feminist inquiry, women's experiences, specifically those of Nightingale and Leigh-Smith, are the major 'objects' of investigation. The concluding interpretation provides a synthesis that is emancipatory as well as knowledge generative.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): In the presence of the electronic medical record [EMR], do desk shape and computer/printer position influence clinician-patient interactions and clinic visit satisfaction? OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1) reduce the temptation to stare at the EMR while talking and listening to the patient; 2) collaborate with architects, furniture designers, and craftsmen to redesign the clinic desk, improve access to the computer screen, and reorganize the space around the desk; 3) to determine if these changes affected the patient-clinician interaction during a regular office visit . DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): With a health and design grant from the School of Architecture and an internal grant from the Division of General Medicine, we conceived, designed, built, and installed the “magic desk” in an exam room at an internal medicine clinic. This desk is a curved wooden platform that is anchored to the wall, appears to float in place, and makes it easier for the patient to share the computer screen with the doctor or nurse. It has a built in swivel for moving the screen in or out of view, per HIPPA restrictions. For images see: http:// uvadesignhealh.org/docs/news/fellow-project-eye-contact-in-exam-rooms. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): In order to determine the effect of the desk on the clinical encounter we designed a survey for patients and one for doctors. Patients were randomly assigned to be seen by their regular physician or nurse practitioner in either the redesigned room or in the standard room. The standard desk was a sheet metal desk with square corners and stationary computer screen. After the visit the research assistant asked patients if they felt the EMR was good for their health care, whether their doctors looked at them more than the computer, seemed interested in listening to them, shared EMR information with them, and spent enough time with them. Doctors were surveyed at the end of each session and asked if being in the redesigned room made it easier to listen to patients, maintain eye contact, and finish the note during the visit. We also asked if the doctors preferred one room to the other. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE eFINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): The study was conducted in the summer of 2013. There were 43 study room patients, 36 standard room patients, 11 attending physicians, 1 nurse practitioner. One patient refused to complete the after visit survey. All patients were at clinic for routine follow-up visits. There were no significant differences in the demographics of the two groups of patients: each group had slightly more women than men, slightly more white than non-white patients, and approximately half the patients were older than 50 years. The length of the doctor patient relationship was also similar in the groups: approximately 25 % knew the doctor longer than 5 years. Comparison of the patient survey results from the patients seen in the redesigned room versus those seen in the standard room showed no significant differences. Almost without exception patients felt the EMR was good for their health care. Regardless of the room, almost all patients felt their doctors looked at them more than the computer, spent enough time with them, and were interested in their stories. In general, these patients were highly satisfied with their doctors and their care. Results of the doctor survey showed that in 75 % of the sessions, the doctors preferred the redesigned room to the standard room. Eighty percent of the time they felt that the redesigned room made eye contact easier. The redesigned room did not make it easier to listen; nor did it improve efficiency. As pretty as the desk is, moving the printer out of the way also made a lasting positive impression on the doctors working in that room. KEY L SS

%X Methods: We recruited 10 hospitals from a surgical quality improvement organization. Nurse reviewers were trained to abstract rectal cancer data from hospital medical records, and abstracts were assessed for accuracy. We conducted two surveys to assess the training program and limitations of the data abstraction. We validated data completeness and accuracy by comparing hospital medical record and tumor registry data. Purpose: Quality improvement programs in Europe have had a markedly beneficial effect on the processes and outcomes of rectal cancer care. The quality of rectal cancer care in the United States is not as well understood, and scalable quality improvement programs have not been developed. The purpose of this article is to describe the implementation of a hospital-based quality assessment program for rectal cancer, targeting both community and academic hospitals. Results: Nine of 10 hospitals successfully performed abstractions with ≥ 90% accuracy. Experienced nurse reviewers were challenged by the technical details in operative and pathology reports. Although most variables had less than 10% missing data, outpatient testing information was lacking from some hospitals' inpatient records. This implementation project yielded a final quality assessment program consisting of 20 medical records variables and 11 tumor registry variables. Conclusion: An innovative program linking tumor registry data to quality-improvement data for rectal cancer quality assessment was successfully implemented in 10 hospitals. This data platform and training program can serve as a template for other organizations that are interested in assessing and improving the quality of rectal cancer care. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

%X Background: Health care associated infection is a major and increasing problem to health (Scottish Executive 2002). The Scottish Government and the previous Scottish Executive have commissioned a great deal of work over the years. One such initiative to address HAI is the cleanliness champion (cc) programme. Aims/Objectives: . The programme launched by NHS Education Scotland (NES) in June 2003 aimed at having a cc in all clinical areas in Scotland. . Chief Nursing Officer directive stated that all G Grade Nurses/midwives should lead by example, in addition the programme was to be implemented for all undergraduate nurses/midwives. . Development of this pilot was in response to a poor completion rate and to facilitate the progression of this learning locally. Methods: The initial/desired method promoted by NES was to deliver the programme by e learning, this presented a challenge for NHS Grampian. It was decided to undertake a 4 day pilot programme to provide a protected learning environment. A hardcopy cc pack was utilised for each participant. All Infection Prevention and Control Nurses (ICPN) and Practice Education Facillitator's (PEFs) used the same format and additional/supporting materials. Each module was assessed and signed off at the time of completion, giving immediate feedback to participants 100% Completion rate by the end of the 4 days protected time. The Professional Lead Nurses within the CHP led by example and undertook the programme as part of the 1st cohort Pilot 100% completion. The 4 day programme supported by IPCN and PEFs. Discussion: The above results indicate that the 4 day supported programme developed by Aberdeenshire CHP improved completion of the programme within set timeframes. This can be attributed to the protected time allocated for this training and the support given by the IPCN and PEFs. Within Grampian it was felt necessary to have an update annually and this has been taken forward by way of a National conference led by NHS Grampian.

%X Conclusion: Timely feedback of data from a statewide quality of care consortium can be associated with decreased morbidity over a relatively short follow-up period in vascular surgical patients. Summary: With the publication of the Institute of Medicine landmark report, To Err is Human in 1999, there has been increased emphasis on identifying processes to improve outcomes and quality of care. There has also been increased oversight from both government and nongovernmental quality organizations. These include national bodies, such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), and more regional quality of care consortiums. A statewide volunteer group of hospitals in Michigan, called the Michigan Surgical Quality Consortium (MSQC), consists primarily of nonteaching hospitals that use the NSQIP data abstraction and reporting format. MSQC feeds back information to individual hospitals. Quarterly conferences review evidence-based practices such as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, pulmonary complications, and transfusions. The authors of this study sought to determine whether improvements in morbidity or mortality have occurred since the inception of the MSQC program. The study involved 16 hospitals that report cases of open vascular interventions. Sampling was done consistent with NSQIP with data abstracted by on-site trained nurses using predefined and validated preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative variables. Follow-up was 30 days. Emergent and outpatient cases were excluded. To assess the effectiveness ofthe MSQC consortium feedback on morbidity and mortality, the authors compared outcomes over the course of two periods: era 1, from April 2005 to March 2007, and era 2, from April 2007 to March 2008. There were 2452 cases in era 1 and 3409 in era 2. Cases were similar between the two eras, with a mean patient age of 68 years, 61% were men, and there were a mean number of relative value units of 21 per patient. Distribution of current procedural terminology (CPT) codes was also similar. Comparing era 1 with era 2, duration of stay and operative time decreased by 15% and 11%, respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was no different, at 2.7% vs 2.5% (P = NS). Morbidity decreased from 15.8% in era 1 to 13.8% in era 2 (P = .2). Decreases were noted particularly in sepsis and pulmonary complications. Modifiable variables (those able to be altered by the surgeon) for morbidity included increased length of operation (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003-1.005; P < .0001), hypertension (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.03-2.1; P < .03), and blood transfusion (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.04- 3.88; P < .0001). Anemic patients (hematocrit < 30) who received a transfusion were less likely to suffer morbidity (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.47-0.67; P<.0001). A cost analysis indicated a cost savings of $172 for payers per vascular case in era 2 vs era 1. Comment: The study indicates that a statewide surgical hospital consortium using the NSQIP platform can produce significant but modest decreases in morbidity over a relatively short time. This decrease in morbidity translated into a significant projected cost savings even though the cost of NSQIP is about $135,000. Financial support of MSQC, a “pay-for-participation” system, is primarily provided by the Blues of Michigan. There is currently an effort to establish regional vascular consortiums nationwide. The cost of collecting and analyzing this type of data is not insignificant, and perhaps efforts should be made for these regional consortiums to be supported by insurance companies rather than individual physicians and hospitals.

%X INTRODUCTION: Human patient simulation has been widely adopted in healthcare education despite little research supporting its efficacy. The debriefing process is central to simulation education, yet alternative evaluation methods to support providing optimal feedback to students have not been well explored. Eye tracking technology is an innovative method for providing objective evaluative feedback to students after a simulation experience. The purpose of this study was to compare 3 forms of simulation-based student feedback (verbal debrief only, eye tracking only, and combined verbal debrief and eye tracking) to determine the most effective method for improving student knowledge and performance. METHODS: An experimental study using a pretest-posttest design was used to compare the effectiveness of 3 types of feedback. The subjects were senior baccalaureate nursing students in their final semester enrolled at a large university in the northeast United States. Students were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 intervention groups. RESULTS: All groups performed better in the posttest evaluation than in the pretest. Certain safety practices improved significantly in the eye tracking-only group. These criteria were those that required an auditory and visual comparison of 2 artifacts such as "Compares patient stated name with name on ID band." CONCLUSIONS: Eye tracking offers a unique opportunity to provide students with objective data about their behaviors during simulation experiences, particularly related to safety practices that involve the comparison of patient stated data to an artifact such as an ID band. Despite the limitations of current eye tracking technology, there is significant potential for the use of this technology as a method for the study and evaluation of patient safety practices.

%X This study examined types of errors that occurred or were recovered in a simulated environment by student nurses. Errors occurred in all four rule-based error categories, and all students committed at least one error. The most frequent errors occurred in the verification category. Another common error was related to physician interactions. The least common errors were related to coordinating information with the patient and family. Our finding that 100% of student subjects committed rule-based errors is cause for concern. To decrease errors and improve safe clinical practice, nurse educators must identify effective strategies that students can use to improve patient surveillance. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

%X A project team from the United Kingdom Oncology Nursing Society developed a blended e-learning website to facilitate nurses to further develop their confidence and competencies in a range of skills related to assessing the holistic needs of people with cancer. The project team identified three areas which were integral to an holistic needs assessment (HNA) implementation project. These were project support information, project management skills, and practical competencies delivered in a blended e-learning package containing a series of accessible video presentations, supporting documents, and practical activities. The team worked with internal and external partners to ensure that a robust and inspiring programme was created. www.hnaforcancer.com was launched in October 2012 as a blended learning programme that incorporates e-learning on core subjects. These subjects are packaged as videoed presentations with supporting learning material and can be accessed via the UKONS website. By the end of the programme participants were equipped to identify and explore the essential requirements for HNA and care planning, more able to recognise potential need, and initiate care to prevent or minimise the risk of complications. Participants had also developed confidence and competency in new skills, including basic project management. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

%X Aims Disrupted sleep is commonly treated with melatonin, especially in children with Neurodevelopmental disorders. (BNF for Children 2014/2015). We surveyed melatonin prescription practices amongst Community Paediatricians in the East of England. Methods In May 2014 we sent out an online survey to all Community Paediatricians in the East of England. Results 17 responses in total were received from all over the region. All Paediatricians prescribe melatonin to children with Neurodevelopmental disorders, Neurodisability (73%), Visual impairment (73%), Intellectual disability (67%) and to Children with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (20%) and behaviour difficulties (20%). Sleep advice is given by all clinicians and promoted through leaflets (56%), referral to Specialist Sleep clinics (38%) and support from other professionals (School Nurses, 13%, Occupational Therapists, 6%, Intellectual Disability Services, 19% and Family workers, 13%). On average clinicians felt sleep hygiene should be tried for 3 months (range 1-6 months) before melatonin is started. Most (59%) clinicians do not routinely assess impairment of function before prescribing melatonin. The main preparation of melatonin prescribed is tablets (94%), followed by liquid (59%) then capsules (41%). Mostly (65%) slow release medication is given. The minimum dose of melatonin prescribed is 2 mg (range 0.5 mg-3 mg), maximum dose range (4-12 mg). Practice varies in how often children are reviewed. Some (35%) review in the first 3-4 months, others 6 monthly (29%). Most (94%) clinicians offer at least yearly reviews. Routine trials off melatonin are offered by 65%. On average children stay 26 months on melatonin before withdrawal (range 6-120 months). In comments Paediatrician gave views regarding the management of disrupted sleep, the need for good sleep hygiene support, which patient groups melatonin is best suited for and management of melatonin treatment. Conclusions This survey has highlighted variability amongst Community Paediatricians in the East of England in certain areas of melatonin prescribing, possibly due to lack of uniform standards. With these results we are therefore creating a generic regional algorithm for initiating melatonin in children with disrupted sleep pattern which may form a platform for developing a melatonin prescription and sleep guideline for individual Organisations.

%X Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has become a chronic disorder for which adaptation of current healthcare practices is needed. In Curaçao, a new organization of chronic HIV care is being set up based on task shifting in which healthcare workers (HCWs) will deliver HIV care more prominently within the primary healthcare system. In preparation for implementation of the proposed task-shifting model, we investigated the perception of HCWs regarding existing HIV care in Curaçao and the need for training in HIV/AIDS among HCWs. An in-depth questionnaire based study was used. Nineteen HCWs of seven different cadres were interviewed. The questionnaire constituted four sections: quality of existing HIV care, respondents own knowledge and willingness to be trained, need for training in HIV/AIDS and preferred educational approaches. Quality of existing HIV services in Curaçao is considered acceptable but needs improvement mainly to facilitate integration of chronic HIV care. All respondents indicated that training in HIV/AIDS is needed among HCWs in Curaçao, especially for nurses and general practitioners. All were willing to participate in training with varying amounts of time to be spent. Training should be tailored to the level of expertise of HCWs and to the role a HCW is expected to have in the new healthcare delivery framework. There is need for training to ensure the effective integration of chronic HIV care into the existing healthcare delivery system in Curaçao.There is a willingness and need in all cadres for training with e-learning as a preferred educational tool.

%X According to Facebook executives, the social network reports 1.06 billion monthly active users. This number has been steadily increasing with a 25% increase in monthly users from last year and a rise of 28% in daily users. Now that we know the numbers what is happening in the world of patients. Though the premise exists that Facebook is strictly for social media networking, I wouldn't hesitate to guess that patients, especially those who are home bound, spend an enormous amount of time on the web. Patients with rare diseases, in particular, have found Facebook to be a useful tool in finding others facing similar circumstances. PatientsLikeMe.com, launched in 2004, uses a number of tools to collect data and derives a hefty profit from selling this data to pharmaceutical companies as well as research institutions. It reports over 200K users on the site covering 1800 diseases. It uses sophisticated questionnaires to gather data about its users. Another active social media network, 23andme.com promotes the selling of an at-home saliva kit to map out genetic codes. They provide users with interactive tools meant “to shed new light on your distant ancestors, your close family and most of all, yourself.” In 2013, this company spent up to $5 million in advertising, further demonstrating that healthcare on the web is a lucrative field. Law firms representing mesothelioma patients spent over $50 million in goggle keyword advertising in 2012, making mesothelioma the most expensive word in Google advertising. Many of the larger firms representing victims of asbestos have now also launched Facebook pages and groups. These are usually marketed as patient support and advocacy sites providing patients with support and referrals to both medical and legal professionals. To the unsuspecting patient, these sites appear to be either VA sponsored or true advocacy sites which could not be further from the truth. Do you really want your patients to receive medical advice and referrals from representatives of legal entities or other for-profit operations with secondary motives? Nurses are the most trusted professionals valued by the public according to numerous surveys. Who is better equipped to engage with patients in social media and help them to understand the “rules of engagement”? The median age for the diagnosis of lung cancer is 72 and for mesothelioma 70. People in their 70s are less likely to be knowledgeable about the risks vs. the benefits of engaging in social media networking. We are all too familiar with the patient or family members who present to the office armed with paperwork obtained during web searches. Some of the information is valuable, but much is not applicable to their current situation and some is entirely misleading. An inordinate amount of time is consumed by those affected by the disease and the practitioner sorting through and commenting on relevancy of such information. I would suggest that if a nurse could guide their navigation of the web and provide accurate medical information and accurate interpretation of this information, the patient and their representatives as well as the provider could have a more focused discussion. Social media provides a unique opportunity to capture large numbers of patients and their advocates which can be used as a tool for both education and support. It would be the role of the nurse to explain the workings of the platform and to set guidelines to assist in protecting privacy to the degree possible when engaging on these sites. Patients need to understand the potential consequences of engaging in online health-related discussions and must be willing to accept the risks associated with membership in a group. It is fairly common for potential employers to peruse Facebook pages to gather additional background information on future employees. It could certainly be feasible that health insurance companies, especially if a dispute arises, might also turn to social media for information. Patients should be encouraged to read the privacy policy on these sites and an open dia og e about privacy within the group should be an ongoing. Patients themselves are the driving force in this healthcarerelated online movement. As a result, hundreds of groups run by patients are available for others to join and this is where this trend can become problematic. Patients with the loudest voice on Facebook, or perhaps the miracle responders, can sway a captive patient group into potential risky decisions with the best of intentions. Groups starting off as support groups can quickly and unexpectedly have their conversations shift toward sharing of medical information and practice. As nurses, we know that patients need to be fully informed without bias to be able to practice good decision-making. Nurse-led groups can promote support and can help to guide the conversation to avoid misinformation or “cyber opinion bullying” by the strongest patient leader. Nurses can designate a peer group leader but promote their role within the group as the medical monitor. This provides an opportunity to gently correct misinformation and present new medical information to the group thus maintaining professionalism and the integrity of the group. Patients with rare diseases are often isolated and local support groups may not be applicable to their particular situation. Patients in these groups often express relief that they are able to connect with others in similar circumstances. However, connecting with others in this manner can be bittersweet. The group can celebrate the victories but will also mourn setbacks and death of group members. Having a nursing professional in the group provides access to a trained individual who can assist in emotional healing as well as recognize and refer if group members need one on one counseling. In cancer, less than 10% of all patients enroll in clinical trials. As nurses we can educate patients about clinical trials and promote participation in such trials. Cancer patients are seeking knowledge on the web, and as educators, it is our role to see that this need is met.

%X There are many myths regarding registration in clinical databases. One of the persistent ones is that it is time consuming and needless for the patient and the clinician. Another is that data seem to disappear into a deep hole, never again to reappear. The DANBIO registry was established almost 10 years ago. Today, more than 10.000 patients with inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis) have been included and followed longitudinally. The database includes patients irrespective of the treatment they receive, and thus data are collected both regarding patients treated with biologicals and patients on disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The aim of the registry is two-fold: To be a powerful research database on e.g. treatment effectiveness, adverse events and quality of life, while simultaneously providing a “disease chronicle” for the rheumatologist to improve the quality of clinical care. Data are captured electronically from the source, e.g. the patient enters HAQ, BASDAI and other patient-reported outcomes on a dedicated touch screen in the waiting room. Nurses, rheumatologists and other health care professionals enter data on e.g. joint counts, medications, and adverse events on their computers during the consultation. Compared to a paperbased registry, this is time saving, eliminates double work and reduces the risk of errors. Importantly, the professionals get immediate access to a well-presented longitudinal electronic patient record that gives an overview and improves clinical decision-making during the visit. The user interface is intuitively designed, requiring only little instruction of the patients and professionals. Two types of variables are collected in the registry: Baseline (fixed) variables e.g. date of birth, gender, date of diagnosis, and follow-up variables that change over time, e.g. treatment, disease activity, radiographic status, and adverse events. The IT-platform of DANBIO (www.danbio-online.dk) is based entirely on so-called “Open Source software”. Sensitive patient data can only be accessed by the use of an individual log-on to the system. The main research focus on DANBIO data has so far been on drug efficacy. A direct comparison of the 3 TNF inhibitors showed significant differences between remission rates, ACR70 response rates, EULAR good response rates and drug survival rates (1). Other studies have investigated the impact of changed prescription practice and of switching between TNF inhibitors (2-4). Data from DANBIO showed that although quality of life is impaired in patients with RA, it is almost normalized in patients who are in CDAI remission (5). More recently, DANBIO has published efficacy and drug survival data on patients with AS treated with biologics (6) as well as data on the radiographic progression during TNF inhibitor treatment (7-8).

%X The objective of this study was to design a Web-based implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) module that would allow greater access to learning which could occur at an individual's convenience outside the fast-paced clinical environment. A Web-based ICD software educational program was developed to provide general knowledge of the function of the ICD and the interpretation of the stored electrocardiograms. This learning tool could be accessed at any time via the Columbia University Internet server, using a unique, password protected login. A series of basic and advanced ICD terms were presented using actual ICD screenshots and videos that simulated scenarios the practitioner would most commonly encounter in the fast-paced clinical setting. To determine the usefulness of the site and improve the module, practitioners were asked to complete a brief (less than 5min) online survey at the end of the module. Twenty-six practitioners have logged into our Web site: 20 nurses/nurse practitioners, four cardiac fellows, and two other practitioners. The majority of respondents rated the program as easy to use and useful. The success of this module has led to it becoming part of the training for student nurse practitioners before a clinical electrophysiology rotation, and the module is accessed by our cardiac entry level fellows before a rotation in the intensive care unit or electrophysiology service. Remote electronic arrhythmia learning is a successful example of the melding of technology and education to enhance clinical learning.

%X Introduction: Emergency department (ED) resuscitation requires the coordinated efforts of an interdisciplinary team. Human errors are common and have a negative impact on patient safety. Although crisis resource management (CRM) skills are utilized in other clinical domains, most emergency medicine (EM) caregivers currently receive no formal CRM training. Objectives: The objectives were to compile and compare attitudes toward CRM training among EM staff physicians, nurses, and residents at two Canadian academic teaching hospitals. Methods: Emergency physicians (EPs), residents, and nurses were asked to complete a Web survey that included Likert scales and short answer questions. Focus groups and pilot testing were used to inform survey development. Thematic content analysis was performed on the qualitative data set and compared to quantitative results. Results: The response rate was 75.7% (N = 84). There was strong consensus regarding the importance of core CRM principles (i.e., effective communication, team leadership, resource utilization, problem-solving, situational awareness) in ED resuscitation. Problems with coordinating team actions (58.8%), communication (69.6%), and establishing priorities (41.3%) were among factors implicated in adverse events. Interdisciplinary collaboration (95.1%), efficiency of patient care (83.9%), and decreased medical error (82.6%) were proposed benefits of CRM training. Communication between disciplines is a barrier to effective ED resuscitation for 94.4% of nurses and 59.7% of EPs (p = 0.008). Residents reported a lack of exposure to (64.3%), yet had interest in (96.4%) formal CRM education using human patient simulation. Conclusions: Nurses rate communication as a barrier to teamwork more frequently than physicians. EM residents are keen to learn CRM skills. An opportunity exists to create a novel interdisciplinary CRM curriculum to improve EM team performance and mitigate human error. © 2008 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.

%X Introduction / objectives: African Partnerships for Patient Safety (APPS) stimulated such national action National action on infection control in Ethiopia - key steps are outlined. Methods: As the result of patient safety sensitization presentations given about the APPS partnership between Gondar Hospital and Leicester Hospital, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) was inspired to begin an extensive pilot program of its own. Technical support was given to the FMOH to clarify specific short and long term patient safety priorities. Existing FMOH infrastructure and partners were identified to provide a platform for training and monitoring & evaluation. Results: Patient safety was established as a FMOH priority in the 5 year plan (2010-2015) with specific activities: 1. An Ethiopian FMOH National Patient Safety Program was established prioritizing 4 patient safety action areas in 3 pilot university hospitals. A FMOH technical working group was re-invigorated to cover both patient safety and infection control. 2. FMOH hospital management guidelines revised to include patient safety action areas. 3. National Nursing Standards of Care training material revised to include patient safety. 4. National production of alcohol based hand rub was initiated. Conclusion: APPS catalyzed national patient safety action in Ethiopia, resulting in a rapid nationally led integration of patient safety strategy, policy, training, and harmonization of support activities. This potentially sustainable national patient safety program can be replicated elsewhere.

%X Background: An increasing number of heart failure patients receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to prevent premature cardiac mortality. There is growing evidence that many patients receive multiple futile shocks from their device when nearing end-of-life. Recent studies indicate ICD deactivation is infrequently discussed with expert clinical guidelines not being implemented in practice. Purpose: To examine the attitudes of healthcare professionals' through-out Europe regarding the discussion and deactivation of an ICD at end-of-life. Methods: The factorial survey combines the strengths of experiment (random manipulation of variables) and survey design (improved recruitment), making it an ideal methodology to explore and measure the impact of implicit factors on decision-making. Data from a systematic literature review, retrospective case note review and ten case studies were refined to determine nine factors or Independent Variables (IV). The factorial survey consisted of a short demographic questionnaire followed by six unique clinical vignettes which embedded the IVs. The anonymised survey was distributed electronically through a secure IT platform to healthcare professionals in Europe involved in the management of patients with an ICD. Statistical analysis included multiple regression and ANOVA. Results: A total of 1,518 vignettes were completed by 253 professionals (cardiologists, specialist nurses and cardiac physiologists). Preliminary results showed the majority of professionals agreed the cardiologist should initiate the discussion, although specialist nurses felt equipped to undertake this responsibility. Professionals in post for more than six years were found to be more confident in initiating the discussion (p=0.001). There was diversity of opinion on when a discussion about deactivation should take place with an overall reluctance by professionals to discuss prior to device implantation. Consensus was found among professionals, and in line with guidelines, that deactivation should be discussed when death was imminent. Clinical indicators of severe heart failure (p=<0.0005), presence of malignancy (p=<0.0005) and a patient receiving multiple ICD shocks (p=0.004) were associated with an increased likelihood of a discussion. In terms of the decision to deactivate an ICD, professionals believed patients should be involved with many wishing for inclusion of next of kin. Conclusions: Professionals are missing opportunities to inform patients and enable shared decision-making regarding their ICD. Innovative strategies across Europe require to be developed that aim to improve professionals' adherence to expert guidelines and ultimately benefit patient care.

%X Review question/objective The aim of this systematic review is to present the best available evidence on teaching and learning strategies or methods preferred by 'Generation Y' health care professional students. The specific review question to be addressed is: What are the teaching and learning strategies or methods preferred by 'Generation Y' health care professional students? Objectives The quantitative objective is to identify teaching and learning approaches and activities preferred by 'Generation Y' students in health professional tertiary education, reported by students. The qualitative objective is to describe the meaningfulness of teaching and learning approaches and activities preferred by 'Generation Y' health professional students in tertiary education as reported by students. Background The goal of health professional education is to produce competent graduates who are eligible for registration with a regulatory body. Universities endeavor to provide high quality professional programs aimed at developing the knowledge, skills and professional attributes students will require to practice their health care profession. Students are an important stakeholder in the process of monitoring and evaluating the quality of programs, courses and teaching and learning1. Student perspectives can also be an integral part of quality enhancement procedures aimed at improving teaching and learning activities2. One student group, those considered 'Generation Y' are said to have unique teaching and learning preferences from previous generations. 'Generation Y' is used commonly as a stereotypical descriptor for the majority of undergraduate students in Australian Tertiary education3. In generational theory, the socio-cultural construction of society is based on distinct generations: the 'GI generation' born in the period 1901-1924; the 'Silent Generation' 1925-1942; the 'Baby Boomers' 1943-1960; 'Generation X' 1961-1982; 'Generation Y' (also known as the 'Millennials') 1983 - 2002 and 'Generation Z' from 2003 onwards4. The sociologist Karl Mannheim first proposed that each generation has a similar worldview, due to exposure to common historical and social events during their formative years5. Every member of a specific generation will not have experienced the same life events, but they will have a shared awareness which creates a 'generational personality'6. Prensky (2001) argued that "today's students are no longer the people our educational systems were designed to teach" 7(p.1). The premise being that this group has different expectations and learning styles than previous generations8. This assertion is based on the arrival and rapid dissemination of technology in the formative years of 'Generation Y' students, with the purported consequence that this group thinks and processes information differently, as they are 'digital natives'8, 9, 10, 11. Consequentially, it is claimed that 'Generation Y' has a relationship with technology that is intuitive and spontaneous, with technology use being as natural as breathing12. Technology as an overarching term includes computer games, computers, email, the internet, mobile phones and social networking13. Although all generations use technology, Prensky (2001) termed older generations 'digital immigrants' as they maintain traditional learning styles which are enhanced by, rather than molded by, technology7. Many authors have concluded that as 'Generation Y' students have assimilated technology into their daily lives new educational methods and approaches are required to accommodate their different learning preferences14, 15, 16, 17. These different methods include the inclusion of 'fun' learning activities within multimedia environments, reflecting the visually rich internet, gaming and other technologies which students are said to have engaged with throughout their lives15, 9, 18. Additionally, due to the immediacy of technology, authors have suggested that this group have short attention spans, are skilled multitaskers and are easily bored19, 10. Recommended teaching and learning st at gies therefore include more interactive activities, providing information in shorter segments as well as creating more experiential activities which may include technologies such as gaming, blogs, wikis, on line discussions, social networking and simulation20, 21, 14, 22, 23, 16. As these methods facilitate collaboration and sharing they are collectively termed Web 2.0 technologies24. Conversely some writers have argued that these responses by education is a form of 'moral panic' based on little evidence that all students have been immersed in technology in their formative years or indeed have different learning preferences than other generations25. This view was supported in the findings of two surveys of health professional students, one of nursing students and one of dental hygienist students in the USA. Both reported no difference in preferred teaching methods between generations26, 27. Regardless, universities are continuing to use technology for the benefit of all generations, making courses more accessible and flexible with some courses delivered entirely on-line28. However, in some health professions there are indications that this may not meet the preferences of 'Generation Y' students. In the surveys mentioned above, most students did not favor completing fully on line courses but preferred blended courses, those with both traditional and online formats26, 27. Blended courses, in one comparative study of student nurses, has also been reported as being more effective than traditional formats, finding that students that participated in a blended learning course received higher grades than those who participated in the same course using traditional delivery29. Blended learning provides opportunity for face to face learning, which was also reported by nursing students as a teaching preference, describing that skill demonstration was more valued than lectures on skills27. On-line learning, which can be rich in visual and aural content, often involves participating in some way in groups. Working together in groups has also been a reported preference of 'Generation Y' students as a consequence of students' communicating in groups through mobile phones, participation in on-line gaming and other technologies such as social networking connecting them to each other and to the global world14, 30, 9. Group work can be used as a learning approach as well as a method of both formative and summative assessment. Nursing students in the USA, however, reported they preferred lectures to group work and group work, inside or outside of class, was not a preferred teaching method27. Alternatively, dental hygienist students reported group work as favorable but students preferred to pick their own work groups rather than be assigned peers by faculty26. Contrary to the 'Generation Y' stereotype of a highly technologically competent generation, Sanders (2007) found that 1st year medical students in the UK, whilst being open to using collaborative Web 2.0 technologies, had little experience of their use prior to university31. Furthermore, one Australian inter-university study reported that students, including those in 'professional programs', varied in their use and skill in technology, with advanced power users in the minority32. Nevertheless, there are developments in health professional education such as simulation through virtual reality or avatars being developed and these are an extension of both Web 2.0 and computer gaming technology30. Generational theorists advocate that 'Generation Y' students are experienced gamers and therefore are ideally placed to learn using this technological media. However, one study of nurses in two American universities found that most 'Generation Y' students did not play computer games but most respondents, across generations, saw the potential for this media and were positive about its introduction into nursing education33. This may indicate that 'Generation Y' students have a preference for Web 2.0 technologies in education but may require suitable preparation before participating in highly techno og cal learning environments. These studies have indicated that 'Generation Y' health professional students in tertiary education have a unique perspective on appropriate teaching and learning methods which contribute towards the development of graduating competence. A search of the Cochrane Library, the Joanna Briggs Institute Library, in addition to CINAHL, Medline and PROSPERO databases indicated that no systematic review exists or is underway to explore the teaching and learning preferences of 'Generation Y' health professional students. A systematic review will inform health professional educators of 'Generation Y' students preferred teaching and learning activities relevant to the development of high quality courses and curricula.

%X Background Despite the importance of research literacy for nurses, many nurses report feeling unable to effectively read and understand research, which in turn results in lower research utilization in practice. Nurses themselves identify poor experiences with trying to understand and use research as factors that contribute to a reluctance to utilize research. This reluctance often leads nurses to seek other sources of information, such as colleagues, instead. Objectives The objective of this review was to identify the effectiveness of research literacy interventions on the research literacy of registered nurses. Inclusion criteria Types of participants Registered nurses. Types of interventions Interventions of interest were those that evaluated the effectiveness of workplace educational programs or interventions conducted in a healthcare organization or tertiary-level educational facility aiming to improve or increase registered nurses’ understanding of research literature. Type of outcome measures Outcomes of interest were research literacy, measured explicitly or as research knowledge, research understanding, use of research evidence in practice, and/or ability to critically appraise research. Type of studies We considered experimental study designs such as randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and before and after studies. Search strategy A wide range of databases were searched in order to provide the most complete possible review of the evidence. Initial keywords used were: "research litera*", "research education", “research knowledge”, “evidence-based practice education”. Methodological quality Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBIMAStARI). Data extraction Data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI. Data synthesis Quantitative data would have been, if possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Cochrane Collaboration’s Review Manager 5.2 software. As statistical pooling was not possible, the findings are presented in narrative form including tables and figures where appropriate to aid in data presentation. Results The majority of included studies were single-group pre-test/post-test designs (n=7). One was a post-test only two-group comparison and two were two-group quasi-experimental studies. Included studies were conducted in Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, United Kingdom and United States. The total number of registered nurses in the included studies was 453. The educational interventions were conducted in universities (n=6) and healthcare facilities (n=4). Most included studies were published (n=9), with one unpublished study. Conclusions The evidence on educational interventions, while not strong, is indicative of the types of interventions which are likely to be effective. Online or face-to-face interventions using interactive teaching strategies, such as activities, role-play and discussions, and which are underpinned by an appropriate behavioral or education theory, are likely to increase research literacy. Implications for practice ● Educational interventions for nurses’ research literacy should be designed to be as interactive as possible. ● Interactive research education can have effects on improving nurses’ critical appraisal skills and research knowledge. ● The use of an appropriate educational or behavioral theory may improve the effectiveness of the intervention. ● The platform for the education (in-person or online) is less important than the design of the activities and the amount of interaction. ● The length of the intervention appears to have little impact on its effectiveness. Implications for research More rigorous experimental studies of educational interventions for nurses’ research liter cy are warranted, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of different course and program designs. Future studies should consider longer periods of follow-up to test the longevity of the effect, as education needs to have lasting effects to be beneficial to the recipients.

%X Introduction The amounts of CIED devices that have been implanted since 2008 have grown exponentially, resulting in increasing numbers of patient visits in already overcrowded clinics. We also have a shortage of qualified electro physiologists. Accessing patient medical records to obtain up to date information in a timely manner to provide safe and efficient treatment can be a slow process as medical records are often located in many separate areas with access restrictions in the system. New methods need to be created that are safe and efficient to help alleviate the burden on health care services. Introducing telemonitoring with adaptable, computer-interpretable and evidence-based clinical guideline models can be a viable option for a busy clinic, utilizing the nursing staff to assess and evaluate the alerts and reports being sent from the CIED devices. Methods Using standard interfaces exposed data from the patients CIED provided by the remote monitoring service, electronic health care record (EHR) and patient health care record (PHR) are collected and then correlated. The data are converted to HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format to interface with the iCARDEA system. Using state of the art data analysis techniques patient specific warnings and suggestions will be automatically generated enhancing the data presented. An adaptive care planner applying clinical guidelines and risk assessment will generate alarms. The care planner will be activated whenever an event is detected. An integrated patient health care record (PHR) will enable the patient to obtain knowledge, to make informed responsible decisions for their health care, allow a communication portal between nurse and patient, and provide the care givers an up to date status of the patient. The nurse is responsible for evaluating the information received from all souces including recommendations from the iCARDEA CarePlanner.A cardiologist will be contacted when medical intervention is needed. The nurse is also responsible for the telemonitoring logistics and management. Results At present care plans have been developed for atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, as well as for potential technical problems. The nurse activates the care planner whenever an event is detected. The steps for care plan execution are then provided, and a link is given for a graphic monitoring tool providing a work flow that allows the results of each step in the decision process to be visable including the data retrieved from the EHRs (medications lab results etc.). For every step in the decision process the PHR and EHR will be accessed which reduces the time staff needs to accumulate various medical information. After a recommendation is presented different options are provided, such as guidance on prescription of medications, doses, and possible side effects. Conclusion iCARDEA provides quick access to important medical records supports treatment decisions; assissting the nurse in making sure that the CIED patient is being cared for according to the current clinical guidelines. It will also help facilitate the early detection of events allowing for a timely treatment of the patient. The decrease in clinic visits will decrease the burden on the patient and health care system. A pilot study is planned after all the systems components are completed.

%X Background: Insulin is a high-risk medication that is available in a range of products with potential for harm if administration errors occur. Anecdotally, insulin product knowledge among hospital health professionals is poor. Aim: To develop and evaluate an insulin e-learning module to improve the knowledge of hospital health professionals of insulin products and their appropriate use. Method: An Internet-based module was developed using Microsoft ASP.NET. Participants (doctors, nurses, pharmacists) undertook an initial knowledge test (pre-test) on insulin products. After viewing an educational slide show, participants then undertook another evaluation (post-test). Both tests contained 12 identical multiple choice questions. To pass the module successfully participants were required to score full marks on the post-test. On completion, participants were asked to complete a brief survey on the usefulness of the module. The module was evaluated by comparing test scores and reviewing the responses to the survey. Knowledge retention was assessed by inviting participants who had passed to repeat the test after 3 months. Results: 324 participants undertook the pre-test (7.4% doctors, 79% nurses, 7.1% pharmacists). 13 (4%) participants scored full marks on the pre-test and did not proceed to the slide show. 200 (85%) of the 235 participants who viewed the slide show and undertook the post-test, scored full marks. At 3 months, only 44 of the 213 participants who scored full marks in the pre-test and post-test agreed to the re-test with 10 (23%) participants achieving full marks. Conclusion: The e-learning module was effective in delivering information on insulin products to hospital health professionals. Incorporating this e-learning module into a mandatory formal education session with a revision strategy might improve participation and knowledge retention rates.

%X The authors conducted a randomised controlled trial of four pedagogical methods commonly used to deliver teamwork training and measured the effects of each method on the acquisition of student teamwork knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The authors recruited 203 senior nursing students and 235 fourth-year medical students (total N = 438) from two major universities for a 1-day interdisciplinary teamwork training course. All participants received a didactic lecture and then were randomly assigned to one of four educational methods didactic (control), audience response didactic, role play and human patient simulation. Student performance was assessed for teamwork attitudes, knowledge and skills using: (a) a 36-item teamwork attitudes instrument (CHIRP), (b) a 12-item teamwork knowledge test, (c) a 10-item standardised patient (SP) evaluation of student teamwork skills performance and (d) a 20-item modification of items from the Mayo High Performance Teamwork Scale (MHPTS). All four cohorts demonstrated an improvement in attitudes (F(1,370) = 48.7, p = 0.001) and knowledge (F(1,353) = 87.3, p = 0.001) pre- to post-test. No educational modality appeared superior for attitude (F(3,370) = 0.325, p = 0.808) or knowledge (F(3,353) = 0.382, p = 0.766) acquisition. No modality demonstrated a significant change in teamwork skills (F(3,18) = 2.12, p = 0.134). Each of the four modalities demonstrated significantly improved teamwork knowledge and attitudes, but no modality was demonstrated to be superior. Institutions should feel free to utilise educational modalities, which are best supported by their resources to deliver interdisciplinary teamwork training.

%X Background: Inter-professional teamwork skills for geriatric care are integral to education of health professional students. Logistical challenges hinder longitudinal in-person small-group experiences so we created an interactive web-based system to foster and measure collaboration around care of virtual patients. Methods: Designed by faculty from the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work, the case system annually engages more than 600 senior students from these schools in teams of 7 to 9 that collaborate for 6 weeks. In each of 4 chapters of a complex unfolding geriatric case, every student receives discipline-specific patient information. Students share data using an electronic chart within the system and answer questions individually based on charted information. Then, each team collaboratively answers the same questions, building competency in geriatrics and teamwork. Each choice for each of 60 questions may be selected, forcing approximately 529 decisions, all linked to core competencies. Possible scores range from -9580 to +9280 (range 18,860). A message board supports asynchronous dialogue. Closing each chapter, students conduct peer evaluations of each other. Extensive automated data capture quantifies degree of engagement, knowledge and decision-making. Results: Team scores from the first 295 users on 40 teams (8-27- 12 through 11-16-12) varied from +2850 to +6530. Individuals' average score by team ranged from 1977 to 4230. Social work students' scores were lower (Median = 1480, p<0.01 for all comparisons) reflecting a “medical” focus of many questions; there were insignificant differences between median scores for students from medicine (3780), nursing (3540), and pharmacy (3220). Strongest univariate predictors of team score were individual scores, logins, and post views by the team. Preliminary regression analyses show that number of team views of the dialogue box is the strongest predictor. Conclusions: A virtual case system provided a setting for asynchronous inter-professional learning. The system discriminated between individual performance, and team performance, showing that collaborative behaviors as represented by logins and posts viewed, correlated more strongly with better team performance than did individual performance. This virtual case system represents a novel, effective way to teach and assess geriatric knowledge and inter-professional teamwork.

%X Background: We developed a virtual case system to train and evaluate interprofessional teams on management of geriatric patients. Content was based on the AAMC's 26 medical student geriatric competencies and 8 domains. Students shared data, then answered questions both individually and collaboratively as a team. We analyzed individual performance by students to identify curricular deficits in geriatric concepts. Methods: Over a 12-week period in 2014, 50 interprofessional teams of senior students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and social work (total n = 295) followed a virtual patient through a sequence of 4 health episodes. Students entered case data into a virtual health record, then individually answered questions about patient care and treatment. Items used a multiple response format; students could select a number of different choices under each stem, some right and some wrong. We calculated overall percent correct including both correct and incorrect responses selected. Each question was mapped to as many as 3 AAMC geriatric competencies for medical students. Scores by question were averaged by competency domain and compared using ANOVA. Results: Mean number of questions mapped to each domain was 10.4 ranging from 3 (Falls, Balance, Gait) to 17 (Self-care Capacity) Medical student scores for each domain varied individually and ranged from a mean of 73% (SD 13%) correct (Medication Management and Atypical Presentation of Disease) to 85% (Falls, Balance, Gait, SD 13%). ANOVA tests show that the mean score for Falls, Balance, Gait was significantly higher than the average score for all other domains, while scores for Medication Management and Atypical Presentation of Disease were significantly lower than other domains (p = .03). Comparison across professions showed significantly higher scores (p < .01) in certain domains: Medication Management (pharmacy highest; social work lowest), Atypical Presentation of Disease (medicine highest; social work lowest), and Palliative Care (social work highest; pharmacy lowest). No significant differences were observed in the domains of Hospital Care for Elders and Health Care Planning and Promotion. Conclusions: Based on results of the virtual case, we identified strengths and weakness of our geriatrics curriculum across health professions and have the potential to inform and monitor the impact of future curricular interventions.

%X Abstract: In often chaotic and overcrowded environments, the emergency nurse is expected to manage multiple and often competing tasks simultaneously, whilst keeping up-to-date with evidenced-based practice. The Emergency Department (ED) poses many challenges to the Educator who must develop and credential staff to a safe level of practice. Flexible learning through e-learning modalities has become increasingly prevalent within the tertiary sector, and may potentially be used to complement didactic hospital education programs. Methods: A program of education was developed based on our top 20 presenting complaints. Modules comprised of an audio-recorded PowerPoint lecture, a minimum of two evidence-based articles, an e-learning quiz, and a short refl ection tool. Participants were invited to complete an online evaluation form, post completing the module. Results: At present, seven modules have been produced and were accessed and completed over 50 times in just 3-months. Forty-six evaluations were completed, which demonstrated that module topics were highly relevant (97.8%); the quality education delivery using e-learning was largely above average (41.0%); and, greatly improved participants' knowledge (67.4%) on post course completion. From participant feedback, a home study package containing five modules is available to download to USB, CD and now iPhone. Conclusions: E-learning allows education sessions to be accessed by nurses unable to attend actual presentations. The post-test forced interaction with information within both the lecture and prereadings potentially aiding retention of presented concepts. The self marking online quiz enabled assessment of understanding without further need of educator time in marking. E-learning, although not a replacement for direct clinical teaching, is a valuable tool to meet staff development needs. The program has successfully been RCNA endorsed, with each completed module attracting 2 hours of continue education time.

%X OBJECTIVE: Most burn-injured patients rate their pain during burn wound debridement as severe to excruciating. We explored the adjunctive use of water-friendly, immersive virtual reality (VR) to distract patients from their pain during burn wound debridement in the hydrotherapy tank (hydrotank). SETTING: This study was conducted on inpatients at a major regional burn center. PATIENTS: Eleven hospitalized inpatients ages 9 to 40 years (mean age, 27 y) had their burn wounds debrided and dressed while partially submerged in the hydrotank. INTERVENTION: Although a nurse debrided the burn wound, each patient spent 3 minutes of wound care with no distraction and 3 minutes of wound care in VR during a single wound care session (within-subject condition order randomized). OUTCOME MEASURES: Three 0 to 10 graphic rating scale pain scores (worst pain, time spent thinking about pain, and pain unpleasantness) for each of the 2 treatment conditions served as the primary dependent variables. RESULTS: Patients reported significantly less pain when distracted with VR [eg, "worst pain" ratings during wound care dropped from "severe" (7.6) to "moderate" (5.1)]. The 6 patients who reported the strongest illusion of "going inside" the virtual world reported the greatest analgesic effect of VR on worst pain ratings, dropping from severe pain (7.2) in the no VR condition to mild pain (3.7) during VR. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide the first available evidence from a controlled study that immersive VR can be an effective nonpharmacologic pain reduction technique for burn patients experiencing severe to excruciating pain during wound care. The potential applications of VR analgesia to other painful procedures (eg, movement or exercise therapy) and other pain populations are discussed. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

%X Patients with severe blunt force trauma injuries (e.g., multiple fractures and/or internal injuries) often experience severe to excruciating pain during medical procedures. We explored the adjunctive use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to distract a patient with multiple blunt trauma injuries from his procedural pain during physical therapy. The patient was a 32-year-old male hospitalized after suffering upper and lower extremity injuries when he was hit by a semi truck as a pedestrian. While a nurse assisted the patient's passive range of motion (ROM) leg exercises over two days, the patient spent a total of 10 minutes of physical therapy with no distraction and 10 minutes in VR (within-subjects design, order randomized). Three 0 to 10 graphic-rating-scale pain scores for each of the two treatment conditions served as the primary dependent variables. The patient reported a reduction in pain when distracted with VR. "Pain unpleasantness" ratings during physical therapy dropped from "severe" (mean = 8.5) to "mild/moderate" (4.5). The patient's ROM was 1 degree less during VR on day 1, but the patient achieved 15 degrees greater ROM during VR on day 2. The present study provides preliminary evidence that immersive VR can be an effective adjunctive, nonpharmacologic pain-reduction technique for a patient with multiple blunt trauma injuries experiencing severe pain during physical therapy. The potential utility of VR analgesia for movement or exercise therapy for patients with blunt force trauma injuries should be explored in controlled studies. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X This paper describes the conceptual design and testing of an Interactive Computerised Decision Support Framework (ICDSF) which was constructed to enable student nurses to "think like a nurse." The ICDSF was based on a model of clinical reasoning. Teaching student nurses to reason clinically is important as poor clinical reasoning skills can lead to "failure-to rescue" of deteriorating patients. The framework of the ICDSF was based on nursing concepts to encourage deep learning and transferability of knowledge. The principles of active student participation, situated cognition to solve problems, authenticity, and cognitive rehearsal were used to develop the ICDSF. The ICDSF was designed in such a way that students moved through it in a step-wise fashion and were required to achieve competency at each step before proceeding to the next. The quality of the ICDSF was evaluated using a questionairre survey, students' written comments and student assessment measures on a pilot and the ICDSF. Overall students were highly satisfied with the clinical scenarios of the ICDSF and believed they were an interesting and useful way to engage in authentic clinical learning. They also believed the ICDSF was useful in developing cognitive skills such as clinical reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making. Some reported issues were the need for good technical support and the lack of face to face contact when using e-learning. Some students also believed the ICDSF was less useful than actual clinical placements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Prioritizing personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care is among the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA's) transformational initiatives. As one of the largest integrated healthcare systems, the VHA sets standards for performance measures and outcomes achieved in quality of care. Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a hallmark in oncology nursing care. EBP can be linked to positive outcomes and improving quality that can be influenced directly by nursing interventions. VHA oncology nurses had the opportunity to partner with the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), ONS Foundation, and the Joint Commission in the multiyear development of a comprehensive approach to quality cancer care. Building on a platform of existing measures and refining measurement sets culminated in testing evidence-based, nursing-sensitive quality measures for reliability through the ONS Foundation-supported Breast Cancer Care (BCC) Quality Measures Set. The BCC Measures afforded the VHA to have its many sites collectively assess documentation of the symptoms of patients with breast cancer, the use of colony-stimulating factors, and education about neutropenia precautions provided. Parallel paths of the groups, seeking evidence-based measures, led to the perfect partnership in the VHA's journey in pilot testing the BCC Measures in veterans with breast cancer. This generated further quality assessments and continuous improvement projects for spread and sustainability throughout the VHA.

%X Background: Human patient simulation (HPS) has been used since 1969 for teaching purposes. Only recently has technology advanced to allow application to the complex field of trauma resuscitation. The purpose of our study was to validate an advanced HPS as an evaluation tool of trauma team resuscitation skills. Methods: The pilot study evaluated 10 three-person military resuscitation teams from community hospitals that participated in a 28-day rotation at a civilian trauma center. Each team consisted of physicians, nurses, and medics. Using the HPS, teams were evaluated on arrival and again on completion of the rotation. In addition, the 10 trauma teams were compared with 5 expert teams composed of experienced trauma surgeons and nurses. Two standardized trauma scenarios were used, representing a severely injured patient with multiple injuries and with an Injury Severity Score of 41 (probability of survival, 50%). Performance was measured using a unique human performance assessment tool that included five scored and eight timed tasks generally accepted as critical to the initial assessment and treatment of a trauma patient. Scored tasks included airway, breathing, circulation, and disability assessments as well as overall organizational skills and a total score. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare the military teams' scores for scenarios 1 and 2, and the comparison of the military teams' final scores with the expert teams. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The 10 military teams demonstrated significant improvement in four of the five scored (p ≤ 0.05) and six of the eight timed (p ≤ 0.05) tasks during the final scenario. This improvement reflects the teams' cumulative didactic and clinical experience during the 28-day trauma refresher course as well as some degree of simulator familiarization. Improved final scores reflected efficient and coordinated team efforts. The military teams' initial scores were worse than the expert group in all categories, but their final scores were only lower than the expert groups in 2 of 13 measurements (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: No studies have validated the use of the HPS as an effective teaching or evaluation tool in the complex field of trauma resuscitation. These pilot data demonstrate the ability to evaluate trauma team performance in a reproducible fashion. In addition, we were able to document a significant improvement in team performance after a 28-day trauma refresher course, with scores approaching those of the expert teams.

%X Background: In 3/2011 The Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai implemented a cancer quality program This involved the establishment of several new committees including a QI committee and a chemotherapy council focused on the provision of evidence-based treatment regimens, implementation of an EMR (7/2011) and an electronic chemotherapy ordering platform (3/2012), relocation to a new practice facility (10/2012) with a focus on operational efficiency and multidisciplinary care, creation of new nursing and pharmacy policies & procedures and successful achievement of quality certifications including Magnet, QOPI and ACOS. We wished to evaluate provider perceptions of the quality initiatives that had been implemented over the past 3 years. Methods: A 10-question survey was distributed to physicians, nurses (practice and infusion), mid-level providers and oncology pharmacists. There were 80 respondents (MD-32, RN/NP-39, Pharm-9) which represents ∼50% of providers in the cancer program. Results: Overwhelmingly, the “best measure of quality” (68% of respondents) was felt to be patient outcomes, not achieving standardized benchmarks, high patient satisfaction scores or certifications. 29% felt that use of evidence-based protocols was the best measure of quality care delivery. Initiatives with the greatest impact on quality were implementation of an EMR and the QI committee. Operational efficiency was felt to be the most important influence on patient experience. Certifications felt to be a reflection of quality care delivery were (in order): QOPI, Magnet (#1 for RN/NPs), ACOS. Only 6% cited Leapfrog. Factors most important for the quality delivery of chemotherapy included certified infusion RNs, electronic chemotherapy ordering, defined nursing and pharmacy protocols and MD/mid-level oversight. 35% felt that patient satisfaction scores were a good measure of quality while 28% felt that patient satisfaction scores were either overemphasized or a poor measure of quality. Conclusions: This survey defines provider views on new quality-focused initiatives and their impact on the quality of patient care delivery for a large, academically-based oncology program. This information can be utilized to inform future initiatives at Mount Sinai and other centers.

The Cepheid GeneXpert platform provides a closed system for nucleic acid amplification and detection that makes it suitable for use outside of specialized laboratory settings including POCT; however, there are no published data on the use of small volume capillary blood for HCV RNA detection. This study assessed the performance of the GeneXpert HCV RNA assay in paired blood samples collected by venous puncture and by finger-prick in subjects with known HCV and HIV status. Methods: Capillary blood was collected by nursing staff using the Roche Accu-Chek Safety Safe-T-Pro Plus Lancet and the Sarstedt Microvette® 100 K3E following established finger-prick procedure. Venous blood was collected in EDTA tubes. The assay was run blind by laboratory staff. Capillary blood (100μl) was transferred directly to the assay cartridge followed by 1ml Xpert diluent. In parallel, plasma (1.1 ml) separated from venous blood was added to another cartridge without sample diluent. Both cartridges were run on the GeneXpert XVI analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilutions (2-5 log10 IU/ml) of plasma from two HCV RNA positive patients (HCV genotype 1a and 3a) were tested in duplicate to verify sensitivity of the 100ul protocol. Results: Of 35 subjects undergoing paired blood collection by finger-prick and venous puncture, 2 were excluded due to insufficient sample and cartridge error, respectively. Of the remaining 33 subjects, 24 were HCV antibody and RNA positive, including 5 that were co-infected with HIV. Their plasma HCV RNA load was median 6.0 log10 IU/ml (IQR 5.5-6.4) and HCV genotypes were 1a, 3a, 1b, and 4. A total of 9 subjects were HCV antibody and RNA negative. In all subjects, results obtained with capillary blood matched those of venous blood, and both were in agreement with the patients' known HCV status. With the serial dilutions, the assay showed good linearity (R2 ≥0.99) and 100% detection rate at 2 log10 IU/ml. Conclusion: The data support the use of small volume capillary blood for HCV RNA detection by GeneXpert, and provide the evidence base for studies evaluating use as POCT in non-specialist laboratory settings.

%X Purpose: The purpose of the pilot study was twofold: to (i) develop a new interprofessional educational module to teach and evaluate student practices in a simulated complex healthcare environment and (ii) determine the feasibility of implementing such a complex interprofessional simulation scenario. Relevance: High-fidelity simulation has been shown to be effective in health sciences education for learning new skills and practicing team approaches to managing complex care (Dunn, 2004; Issenberg et al., 2005; Laschinger et al., 2008). Infection control skills are taught early in most educational programs. A new simulation module developed for senior students would provide the opportunity to practice effective infection control skills in a fast-paced, realistic environment while collaborating with other healthcare providers. Participants: Twenty-four senior health professional student volunteers (9 nursing, 7 medicine, 8 physiotherapy) participated in the pilot of the scenario. Three profession-specific instructors ran the scenario (infection control, physiotherapy, nursing) with two expert observers (infection control practitioner (ICP), research assistant). Methods: Faculty from physiotherapy, medicine, and nursing met with ICPs and an information technology simulation expert and developed 3 critical care patient cases using highfidelity simulators. The 2.5 hour pilot of the scenario included (i) a short video review of infection control practices, (ii) a pre-scenario briefing and role assignment, (iii) 25 minute run of the simulation with Team A (n = 12) as clinicians and Team B (n = 12) as observers, (iv) a 2nd run of the scenario switching teams and (v) post-session focus groups (students, instructors), questionnaires (x3) and observer feedback. Analysis: The quantitative data (student questionnaires) were analysed as descriptive statistics (SPSS©). The qualitative (participant observation&focus group) data transcribed concepts organized into themes representative trustworthy quotes extracted (results will be presented elsewhere). Results: Interprofessional Communication and Teamwork (9 questions/6-point Likert scale): In general students from all professions reported being comfortable with IP communication and teamwork. Nursing students reported less confidence putting forward personal opinions in a group. The majority of the students reported feeling uncomfortable taking the leadership role in a group. Confidence with Infection Control Skills (8 questions/6-point Likert scale): Overall, students were confident with hand hygiene, routine practices, contact precautions and removing personal protective equipment but were less confident with enhanced precautions. Satisfaction with the Interprofessional Infection Control Simulation Module (7 questions/6-point Likert scale): The majority of the students enjoyed the session, felt the IP component was valuable and felt that simulation-based training was valuable. The majority of students felt that the IP infection control simulation session should be mandatory, however, 12.5% of PT students disagreed somewhat, 14.3% of medical students disagreed strongly and 28.6% of medical students disagreed. Observer Feedback: Senior students applied infection control principals poorly within a complex patient care scenario. IP collaboration was evident. The rooms were too crowded. Conclusions: 1. It is feasible to develop and implement a complex, simulation-based interprofessional teaching module. 2. Senior healthcare students may need enhanced infection control practice. 3. The module logistics require review and revision. Implications: In educational institutions where the resources exist to implement high-fidelity simulation scenarios, enhanced infection control practices could be a target skill.

%X Simulation technology is extremely useful for training workers in a variety of industries. Simulation concepts have been developed and refined in full-body patient simulators. Contemporary full-body patient simulators can be used to teach the essential concepts of many healthcare professions, and they offer practice dealing with critical events, concentrating on the thought and decision-making processes related to favorable patient outcomes. Full-body patient simulators provide practitioners the opportunity to manage realistic and advanced physical findings in a variety of areas and are capable of responding to a large number of pharmacologic agents and a host of clinical interventions. The ability to combine high-fidelity educational tools with both classroom lecture and clinical experience provides nurse anesthetists the opportunity for a unique experience in a highly controlled and safe environment. Numerous technological and educational advantages and the chance for hands-on assessment and treatment of some of anesthesia's rarest and most life-threatening events provide a one-of-a-kind educational session for CRNAs.

%X Aim: To describe the newly established NHMRC Chronic Kidney Disease Centre of Research Excellence (CKD.CRE). Background: Globally, CKD is a significant health problem, and, with current trends, the costs of renal replacement therapy might soon be unsupportable in Australia. Nearly all the opportunity to ameliorate end stage kidney failure lies with better understanding and management of CKD. Methods: The CKD.CRE, Australia's only CRE in CKD, is dedicated to improving CKD knowledge and management across the health care spectrum. The Centre, based at the University of Queensland, embraces investigators and collaborators in almost every state/territory. Research themes include establishment of a national CKD surveillance network, accessing already collected data in multiple programs which embrace renal and primary care, and public and private services. They include CKD practice improvement in primary care, nursing care and renal supportive care. They include a biomarker research program based on patients in the CRE's collective CKD registries, with establishment of Australia's only CKD. Biobank. The final stream consists of systematic health economic evaluations woven throughout. Indigenous perspectives are embedded in all streams. Results: The CRE incorporates 5 post-doctoral positions (4 already in place), and six PhD students across the research streams. Preeminent Australian nephrologists, the Head of Health at AIHW, and representatives of peak consumer bodies occupy key governance positions. Work has commenced in all research streams, along with presentations, proposed publications and building of collaborations. Through CKD.QLD, the Centre is affiliated with the Global Network of CKD Cohorts (GNCKDC), through the International Society of Nephrology. Processes are underway for further leveraging of funds. Conclusions: The CKD.CRE should become a major player on the global platform of CKD knowledge and practice improvement.

%X Review question/objective Are educational programs effective in promoting knowledge of pressure ulcers amongst nurses in all types of settings? Background A pressure ulcer is a severe skin complication affecting patients in all health-care settings worldwide. It has been estimated that approximately 20 to 25% of European patients have pressure ulcers. 1 Pressure ulcers are considered to be quality indicators that may result in serious physical and emotional suffering, reducing quality of life, increasing healthcare costs, lengthening hospitalizations, and increasing morbidity rates.2 The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) (2012) includes prevention of pressure ulcers as one of the National Patient Safety Goals.3 The successful prevention of pressure ulcers requires a multidisciplinary approach. Nurses, as primary caregivers, play an important role in preventing and managing complications of pressure ulcers.4 Literature reveals that a lack of knowledge and skills in nurses can influence the implementation and success of interventions to prevent pressure ulcers5,6 and may be associated with increased prevalence of pressure ulcers.7-9 Therefore, adequate knowledge and training for nurses is needed in preventing, detecting and planning appropriate care to prevent and treat pressure ulcers. Several studies report that nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention and management is significantly higher when nurses undergo educational programs.10-13 Therefore, it is suggested that continuing nursing education improves nurses' knowledge and the standards of care related to preventing and caring for patients with pressure ulcers.14 Several educational programs have been suggested to improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention and management, such as face-to-face lectures,14,15 lectures combined with photographs and videos,16 workshops,4,17 computer-based instruction,18 e-learning,19 and training courses.20 Altun & Zencirci (2011) evaluated the effects of an interactive lecture-based three-hour workshop and found that nurses' knowledge of the management of pressure ulcers was significantly improved. Two studies found that face-to-face lecture programs could also improve nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcers.14,16 In addition, e-learning programs are new strategies that have been developed in recent years to promote the knowledge and classification of pressure ulcers among nurses.19 The outcome measures of the educational interventions described above mostly focus on nurses' knowledge on the detection of pressure ulcers.4,14-15,17-18,20 Two studies used photographic teaching in determining differences in accuracy rates,16,19 but the results of the effects were not consistent. Furthermore, Beckman, et al (2008) demonstrated that nurses who underwent e-learning and lectures showed no significant differences in accuracy rates in determining stages on pressure ulcers. 19 However, another study reported different results of the effects of e-learning programs.20 Some studies suggest that educational interventions have positive effects in improving nurses' knowledge4,14-15,17-18 and ability to differentiate stages in pressure ulcers.16 In summary, most of the studies suggest that educational programs have positive effects in improving nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcers, but these studies used different types of educational interventions and different content in their teaching materials, and focused on different outcome measures. There is no systematic review published related to the effectiveness of educational programs in promoting nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcers. Therefore, this review aims to identify the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of educational programs on knowledge of pressure ulcers amongst registered nurses in all types of clinical settings.

%X Chronic wounds are a major healthcare problem costing billions of dollars a year over the world. However, it is regrettable that a large number of chronic wounds are still treated simply by conventional dressing change in local clinics, lacking of definite diagnosis and personalized care. This situation results in a low wound healing rate, unsatisfied life quality of the patients, and higher medical cost for the prolonged promiscuous care. We should not only emphasize the importance of wound care in clinical practice, but also emphasize the importance of establishing wound care centers. With the experience of our practice in wound care center, the construction of wound care technology platform is strongly suggested. This platform could act as an education base to train more professional wound care doctors, nurses, and care workers, as well as resolve many technical difficulties involved in the treatment of many complicated chronic wounds.

%X BACKGROUND: Adults in intensive care units (ICUs) often suffer from a lack of sleep or frequent sleep disruptions. Non-pharmacological interventions can improve the duration and quality of sleep and decrease the risk of sleep disturbance, delirium, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the length of stay in the ICU. However, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness and harms of different non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in adults admitted to the ICU. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults in the ICU.To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are safe and clinically effective in improving sleep quality and reducing length of ICU stay in critically ill adults.To establish whether non-pharmacological interventions are cost effective. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (OVID, 1950 to June 2014), EMBASE (1966 to June 2014), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to June 2014), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to June 2014), CAM on PubMed (1966 to June 2014), Alt HealthWatch (1997 to June 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2014), the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc, 1979 to June 2014), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI Database, 1999 to June 2014). We also searched the following repositories and registries to June 2014: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (ISRCTN Register) (www.controlled-trials.com), the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn), the Clinical Trials Registry-India (www.ctri.nic.in), the Grey Literature Report from the New York Academy of Medicine Library (www.greylit.org), OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform (www.who.int/trialsearch). We handsearched critical care journals and reference lists and contacted relevant experts to identify relevant unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs that evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for sleep promotion in critically ill adults (aged 18 years and older) during admission to critical care units or ICUs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the search results and assessed the risk of bias in selected trials. One author extracted the data and a second checked the data for accuracy and completeness. Where possible, we combined results in meta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. We used post-test scores in this review. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 trials, with a total of 1569 participants, in this review. We included trials of ventilator mode or type, earplugs or eye masks or both, massage, relaxation interventions, foot baths, music interventions, nursing interventions, valerian acupressure, aromatherapy, and sound masking. Outcomes included objective sleep outcomes, subjective sleep quality and quantity, risk of delirium, participant satisfaction, length of ICU stay, and adverse events. Clinical heterogeneity (e.g., participant population, outcomes measured) and research design limited quantitative synthesis, and only a small number of studies were available for most interventions. The quality of the evidence for an effect of non-pharmacological interventions on any of the outcomes examined was generally low or very low. Only three trials, all of earplugs or eye masks or both, provided data suitable for two separate meta-analyses. These meta-analyses, each of two studies, showed a lower incidence of delirium during ICU stay (risk ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.80, P value = 0.002, two studies, 177 participants) and a positive effect of earplugs or eye masks or both on total sleep time (mean difference 2.19 hours, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.96, P value = 0.02, two studies, 116 participants); we rated the quality of the evidence for both of these results as low.There was also some low quality evidence that music (350 participants; four studies) may improve subjective sleep quality and quantity, but we could not pool the data. Similarly, there was some evidence that relaxation techniques, foot massage, acupressure, nursing or social intervention, and sound masking can provide small improvements in various subjective measures of sleep quality and quantity, but the quality of the evidence was low. The effects of non-pharmacological interventions on objective sleep outcomes were inconsistent across 16 studies (we rated the quality of the evidence as very low): the majority of studies relating to the use of earplugs and eye masks found no benefit; results from six trials of ventilator modes suggested that certain ventilator settings might offer benefits over others, although the results of the individual trials did not always agree with each other. Only one study measured length of stay in the ICU and found no significant effect of earplugs plus eye masks. No studies examined the effect of any non-pharmacological intervention on mortality, risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, or cost-effectiveness; the included studies did not clearly report adverse effects, although there was very low quality evidence that ventilator mode influenced the incidence of central apnoeas and patient-ventilator asynchronies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of existing evidence relating to the use of non-pharmacological interventions for promoting sleep in adults in the ICU was low or very low. We found some evidence that the use of earplugs or eye masks or both may have beneficial effects on sleep and the incidence of delirium in this population, although the quality of the evidence was low. Further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The case study evaluated the Second Life perceived usability and the decision-making of insulin administration via situational awareness at two different simulation freezes during Second Life simulation. BACKGROUND: Due to safety issues stemming from nursing knowledge deficits of insulin administration, the use of simulation via practice in a virtual immersive environment, Second Life was evaluated in a case study of practicing nurses. DESIGN: This case study used a single convenience group, post-test design. METHODS: Perceived usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Evaluation of decision-making was evaluated via Situational Awareness Score at two simulation freezes in the Second Life simulation with practicing nurses (n = 12). RESULTS: Nurses with more years of practice reported difficulty in using Second Life. As age increased, the total Situational Awareness Score decreased. Day shift nurses were more likely to obtain a High Situational Awareness Score. CONCLUSIONS: Although usability was nearly obtained, virtual immersive environments for nurses has promise to provide practice in aiding clinical decision-making. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Finding a new platform to allow all nurses to practice difficult clinical decisions is key. A virtual immersive environment, like Second Life, can provide simulation for nurses to practice making such difficult decisions.

These were compared with the actual April 2010 DSN referrals. Results: Blood glucose results from796 patients with diabetes were analysed. Seventy-three patients (9 per cent)were referred to theDSNs; however, a further 103 patients (13 per cent) (45 female, 58 male, average age 70.4 years) whomet the criteriawere not.An additional 28 patients should have been referred from the surgical wards, 20 from elderly care,23from themedical assessment,28from othermedical and four from the orthopaedic wards. Ofthese patients, 63 (61 per cent) had persistent hyperglycaemia, two (2 per cent) had recurrent hypoglycaemia and 24 (23 per cent) had an episode of severe hypoglycaemia. Fifteen (14 per cent) met more than one criterion for referral. A delay in referral was also identified in 13 patients. Conclusion: High numbers of patientswith recurrent hypoglycaemia/ hyperglycaemia or a single episode of severe hypoglycaemia are not referred. Referral guidelines need to be relaunched and the role of ward diabetes link nurses reviewed.Ward staff have been asked to complete the National Patient Safety Agency insulin e-learning package and insulin workshops are planned.

%X Objectives: Acquisition of microbiological knowledge is both intellectual- and skills-oriented. The traditional 'wet-lab' is an important platform to achieve this goal. The heightened interest in microbiology and infectious diseases, and the administrative clustering of many institutions, has lead to increased number of students from geographically diversed locations. As a result, it is increasingly difficult to organise laboratory classes with limited resources such as laboratory space and number of teachings staffs. To address the situation, a web-based“Virtual Microbiology Laboratory”was developed and evaluated for its effectiveness. Methods: Starting 2007/2008, a web-based Virtual Microbiology Laboratory was set up for nursing undergraduate microbiology studies. Students' performance and perception of the course were analysed for three consecutive academic years (2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09; class-size ranged from 174 to 190). These web materials comprised of a series of 58 web images, 19 videos, 9 on-line quizzes and an anonymous forum. Access to this web was voluntary, but usage was logged. Students' learning outcomes were assessed by course evaluation questionnaire (23 items on a 6-point Likert scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree) and examination. The course evaluation was conducted at the end of the course, but prior to the examination. The examination was paper-based with long-answer-questions and a-type MCQ, which were marked by the same panel of teachers. Results: An improved perception on understanding of concepts and interest in microbiology was observed with the launch of Virtual Microbiology Laboratory. An improvement in scoring on the MCQ was also observed (2008/09 vs 2006/07, p < 0.05) However, scoring with long-answer-questions had declined (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The development of Virtual Microbiology Laboratory has stimulated interest among undergraduate students. Their knowledge, however, when assessed by traditional examination method had yielded divergent results. Ability to recall factual information, as tested by a-type MCQ, is enhanced. Ability to assimilate information, and to present them in a logical written manner (as tested by long-answer-question) had declined. While web-based e-learning is a useful shotgun approach to improve the breath of information, it may not replace classroom or bench-side teaching where in-depth discussion are generated, hypothesizing- and theorising-skills are developed and practised.

%X Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important worldwide cause of mortality. In The Netherlands, CVD is the leading cause of death for women and the second cause of death for men. Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of CVD are not well implemented in primary care. In this study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of a tailored implementation program targeted at practice nurses to improve healthcare for patients with (high risk for) CVD. Methods/design: A two-arm cluster randomized trial is planned. We offer practice nurses a tailored program to improve adherence to six specific recommendations related to blood pressure and cholesterol target values, risk profiling and lifestyle advice. Practice nurses are offered training and feedback on their motivational interviewing technique and an e-learning program on cardiovascular risk management (CVRM). They are also advised to screen for the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in patients. We also advise practice nurses to use selected E-health options (selected websites and Twitter-consult) in patients without symptoms of depression. Patients with mild depressive symptoms are referred to a physical exercise group. We recommend referring patients with major depressive symptoms for assessment and treatment of depressive symptoms if appropriate before starting CVRM. Data from 900 patients at high risk of CVD or with established CVD will be collected in 30 general practices in several geographical areas in The Netherlands. The primary outcome measure is performance of practice nurses in CVRM and reflects application of recommendations for personalized counselling and education of CVRM patients. Patients' health-related lifestyles (physical exercise, diet and smoking status) will be measured with validated questionnaires and medical record audit will be performed to document estimated CVD risk. Additionally, we will survey and interview participating healthcare professionals for exploration of processes of change. The control practices will provide usual care. Discussion: Tailored interventions can improve healthcare. An understanding of the methods to reach the improved healthcare can be improved. This research contributes a share of it. Identification of the determinants of practice and developing implementation interventions were two steps which were completed. The subsequent step was implementation of the tailored intervention program. Trial registration: Name trial register: Nederlands trial register. Web address of trial register: http://www.

%X Emotional intelligence (EI) has enjoyed growing attention from researchers, educationalists and the public. Arguably, disagreement over the exact nature of EI fuelled by a low level of widely accepted empirical data has stalled its wider application into some areas of professional training. While enjoying significant popularity in areas such as business and leadership, EI remains largely absent from the curriculum of nursing. This paper argues that EI forms the very cornerstone upon which sits desirable mental health nursing abilities as identified by users and recent professional reviews. While distance education and e-learning play an increasingly significant role in nurse education, the enhancement of EI occurs primarily through a socialization process necessitating a 'repackaging' of the nursing curriculum. This paper also proposes that through using service user needs and recent professional reviews as a source for learning outcomes an outline of this 'repacking' can be achieved. © 2008 The Author.

%X Background: The presented work simulates the principles of electrocardiography using a real-time interactive 3D simulation model of cardiac electrophysiology. The origin of the ECG signal is a complex spatial and temporal phenomenon, but not enough emphasis is commonly given to understanding its generation. Conventional teaching is based on identifying patterns, which are frequently memorized without much thought given to the underlying cause of any particular waveform. Methods: All four cardiac chambers were equipped with cell-nodes and myocardium fiber orientations. Ventricular fibers were based on a canine fiber dataset obtained from DT-MRI. Atrial fibers were constructed manually under the guidance from cardiac morphologists. An approximate model of the heart's conduction tree was manually constructed. Cardiac cell activation sequences were constructed using the Luo-Rudy model and formed the basis for the construction of the inter-cellular activation propagation. A cellular automaton was developed to simulate the propagation of electrical excitation through the 3D cell-nodes. Each cell-node in the automaton possesses a rest state, an excitation threshold, and a diffusive-type coupling to its nearest neighbors. The mean electric axis is then calculated and displayed over a beat cycle. The simulated electric axis is projected onto the standard lead vectors I, II and III of the Einthoven's triangle and the precordial lead vectors V1-V6, so the respective ECG signals can be displayed. Malfunctioning or necrotic regions have been simulated by altering the cell activation profiles in certain regions in the atria or ventricles. Results & Conclusions: The developed application can provide real-time simulation of the heart's electrophysiology. The executable is platform-independent and can be run both offline and online. The application demonstrates the spatial and temporal relationships between the heart's function and ECG signal generation. The solution allows end-users (medical students, trainee cardiologists, nurses) to become intuitively aware by interacting with the cardiac excitation process in real-time 3D, in a bottom-up approach: from cardiac cell to ECG.

%X The Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences at Kingston University/St George's University of London (KU/SGUL) provides a module to train registered nurses to qualify as independent nurse prescribers. During the programme the participants engage in an online learning activity using a virtual patient (VP). The aim of this VP activity is to enable students to consolidate their learning and to practice the range of skills that the students have been developing related to prescribing. The activity was designed by the module leader and was run as a pilot on two groups of students (n = 34). An evaluative study was undertaken on the value of this blended learning activity to the student and their prescribing practice. This paper presents the development, implementation and evaluation of the VP activity. Findings showed that the VP activity was perceived as being particular useful for helping them to learn the skills of patient history/assessment, decision-making and prescription writing. The VP was also perceived as being helpful in developing their confidence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Despite advances by surgeons in assessing quality and safety, the traditional surgical morbidity and mortality (M&M) conference has mostly remained unchallenged and unchanged. The goal of this study was to compare data as reported in a traditional M&M conference to data collected using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) techniques. Study design: A retrospective study was performed comparing data from the M&M conference in a general surgery division, in which complications and deaths were identified by residents or attendings, to data compiled by a nationally audited nurse reviewer from the ACS-NSQIP from July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003. Results: Mortality rates calculated by traditional M&M conference (53 deaths in 5,905 patients), compared with the ACS-NSQIP nurse reviewer (28 deaths in 1,439 patients; 24% sample), were 0.9% versus 1.9%, respectively (p = 0.001). Complication rates reported in M&M were 6.4% versus 28.9% ACS-NSQIP (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses showed that mortality rates, as reported in conference, were substantially lower for both in-hospital and postdischarge patients, when compared with ACS-NSQIP. All subclassifications of complications, as presented in conference, were also lower, compared with ACS-NSQIP. Conclusions: Traditional surgical M&M reporting considerably underreports both in-hospital and postdischarge complications and deaths as compared with ACS-NSQIP. Approximately one of two deaths and three of four complications were not reported in the M&M conference at our institution. A Web-based reporting system based on an ACS-NSQIP platform was created to automate, facilitate, and standardize data on surgical morbidity and mortality. © 2006 American College of Surgeons.

%X This pilot study compares the results of medications calculations carried out by student nurses using an online assessment tool with the results of the same calculations carried out within simulated practice. The numeracy project, of which this is part, is funded by NHS Education for Scotland (NES). Objective: To test the efficacy of a realistic computer-based assessment of pre-registration nurses' medication calculations skills by comparing outcomes from using an online assessment tool with a practical assessment tool in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination OSCE. Both assessment methods used medicine calculations usually presenting authentically in the practice setting. Design: A multi-stage quantitative study using a cross-over design. Sample: Fifty early 3rd year students on the adult branch of a pre-registration nursing programme at a large school of nursing in England. Results: Results showed that, for assessing accuracy of calculation, there was a high level of congruence between the two methods. Conclusions: Computerised assessment of medications calculations using this particular platform is likely to closely mirror assessment of medication calculations done in a practical setting. As such it could be a useful adjunct to current assessment methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Project Description: The app “About Dementia” is an observation tool for caregivers. By using the app, the professional care worker can learn how to identify symptoms in people with dementia and how to respond to changes in the physical condition of a person with dementia. The Danish language app is comprised of 4 parts: Observation wheel: Guidelines for observing changes in the physical condition in people with dementia. E.g. loss of appetite, change in mood or change in appearance can be indicators of physical illness or an indication that more help is needed. Quiz: The user can test his knowledge about physical symptoms in people with dementia. Tips: Advice on communicating with the person with dementia and the relatives/caregivers. Glossary: Explanation of terms related to the field of dementia. We found a need in Denmark for educational materials targeting dementia nurses, social and health care assistants and other healthcare professionals. Many professional care workers in Denmark already use a PDA or a smartphone in their daily work for administrative registration of services, and some hospitals and nursing homes still do not offer WIFI. Format An app - that also works offline - offers easy access and flexibility, which is much needed in the training and education of professional dementia care workers. Choosing the app format, we offer a new way of spreading knowledge and providing training tailored to the needs of our target groups. The app format supports the Danish Dementia Research Centre's educational seminars and conferences, our website and e-learning as a mean of spreading knowledge about dementia. The app “About Dementia” was released in May 2012 and has been downloaded 13.400 times as of January 2014. In comparison approximately 5.000 people attended a seminar or a conference arranged by the Danish Dementia Research Centre in the same time period. The app has received positive feedback in Google Play and AppStore, but more qualitative evaluation is needed in order to validate the usefullness of the app. (Figure Presented).

%X Purpose/Objectives: To describe how the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) smoking-related resources on a mobile health (mHealth) platform were integrated into the workflow of RNs in advanced practice nurse (APN) training and to examine awareness and use of CIS resources and nurses' perceptions of the usefulness of those CIS resources. Design: Descriptive analyses. Setting: Acute and primary care sites affiliated with the School of Nursing at Columbia University. Sample: 156 RNs enrolled in APN training. Methods: The integration was comprised of (a) inclusion of CIS information into mHealth decision support system (DSS) plan of care, (b) addition of infobutton in the mHealth DSS, (c) Web-based information portal for smoking cessation accessible via desktop and the mHealth DSS, and (d) information prescriptions for patient referral. Main Research Variables: Use and perceived usefulness of the CIS resources. Findings: 86% of nurses used the mHealth DSS with integrated CIS resources. Of the 145 care plan items chosen, 122 were referrals to CIS resources; infobutton was used 1,571 times. Use of CIS resources by smokers and healthcare providers in the metropolitan area of New York City increased during the study period compared to the prestudy period. More than 60% of nurses perceived CIS resources as useful or somewhat useful. Conclusions: Integration of CIS resources into an mHealth DSS was seen as useful by most participants. Implications for Nursing: Implementation of evidence into workflow using an mHealth DSS can assist nurses in managing smoking cessation in patients and may expand their roles in referring smokers to reliable sources of information. Knowledge Translation: mHealth DSS and information prescriptions may support smoking cessation interventions in primary care settings. Smoking cessation interventions can be facilitated through informatics methods and mHealth platforms. Nurses' referrals of patients to smoking-related CIS resources may result in patients' use of the resources and subsequent smoking cessation. © 2013 by the Oncology Nursing Society.

%X Introduction: Fussing and colicky infants are challenging to the breastfeeding mother and multiple actions are taken in attempt to improve infant behaviour. One apparently common technique is for mothers to adjust their own habitual diet. Changes instituted have stemmed from 'old-wives tales' and popular beliefs. A major concern of dietary change is that nutritional adequacy may be compromised. The frequency and types of manipulation used and the success of such adjustments are poorly documented. Aims & Methods: To explore the dietary practices of breastfeeding mothers, to define the frequency of dietary change, reasons for such action, and to gauge whether they are at risk of nutritional inadequacy. An on-line survey was developed using Qualtrics software application. Survey questions were designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The survey was anonymous and volunteers were invited to participate through websites and social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Results: Of the 1203 respondents, 1,046 (87%) completed the survey. 780 (75%) modified their usual diet while breastfeeding. The most common reasons were 'baby was unsettled' (33%), 'baby had lots of wind/gas' (29%), 'baby wasn't sleeping well' (18%), 'baby had reflux' (18%) and 'baby had colic' (11%). The most common dietary modifications were minimisation of the intake of alcohol (79%), coffee (43%), cow's milk (24%), milk chocolate (21%), and cabbage, chilli and onion (each 20%). Information was sourced from the internet (46%), maternal and child health nurses (44%), the Australian Breastfeeding Association (37%), and books and mother's groups (each 21%). Sourcing information from paediatricians was less common (9%) and 89% of respondents who had modified their diet had never seen a dietitian. 25% of respondents who had removed dairy did not replace it with other calcium-rich foods nor did they take a calcium supplement. 44% that modified their diet did not take a suggested breastfeeding multi-vitamin for when the nutrition guidelines are difficult to meet. Conclusion: Dietary modification among breastfeeding mothers is common practice (3 out of four) and a variety of food and drink sources are avoided placing them at risk of deficiencies such as calcium. This together with the fact that the majority of information is sourced from the internet and not experts in nutrition suggest this group is at risk of nutritional inadequacies in general.

%X Malaria in pregnancy (MP) is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and evidence suggests that the prevalence of malaria is increasing in Africa'. Despite this, little is known regarding how healthcare practitioners integrate prevention and treatment approaches for MP. The aim of the study was to explore the management of MP in a large urban hospital in Abuja. The hospital where the study was undertaken provides primary and secondary care and serves several districts in Abuja. Approximately 316 patients attend the 97-bed hospital daily. 12% of its capacity is dedicated to maternity care. Following ethics approval from the hospital board, a mixed methods approach was used to collect data from patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and hospital administrators from January to May 2013. 23% (51/227) of medical records belonging to pregnant patients treated for malaria in one calendar year (2012) were explored using a case series approach. Data collected include demographics and details relating to diagnosis and prescribed drugs. Survey respondents were randomly selected while interview participants were pur-posively sampled. 50 questionnaires were distributed to healthcare practitioners and a 72% response rate was achieved. Four members of the formulary committee were also interviewed. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis while Microsoft Excel was used to collate and analyse quantitative data. Strategies adopted to maximise validity include triangulation and peer review. The findings indicated a prevalence of 4.12% with higher incidence among residents of satellite towns (relatively more rural) compared to residents of the municipality (relatively more urban). Regarding tackling MP, nurses employed public health approaches such as advising patients on vector control with nets and insecticides. Doctors and pharmacists focused more on chemo-pro-phylaxis/therapy using anti malarials. In this study, chemo-prophylaxis/therapy was in line with WHO guidelines2 (75% of cases reviewed) but there was evidence of inapriopriate prescibing with proguanil (without combination with chloroquine) and cephalosporins. Participants stated that their practice was underpinned by national and hospital policies. Further investigation revealed the existence of a national policy for the treatment of malaria, but no hospital policies or treatment guidelines. Various relevant professional groups had strategies for addressing MP but these had limitations. Nurses' public health approach ensured a wide coverage and prevention of the condition but was limited by the level of access to relevant materials, such as inescticide treated nets. The chemo-prophylactic/therapetic approach favoured by doctors/pharmacists ensured individualised and targeted treatment from a wide range of antimalarials but increased chances of innappropriate treatment and waste of scarce resources. Policies for treating malaria exist in Nigeria but are inadequate. MP poses significant risk for national health as it affects mothers and their unborn children. Specific guidelines need to be developed to address prevention and treatment for this demography. As settings vary widely in Nigeria, healthcare institutions should be in-centivised to develop treatment/prevention guidelines specific to their context. In the development of these strategies, a multidisciplinary platform should be considered in integrating public health and chemotherapeutic approaches.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the learning effect and resource use cost of workplace-based, blended e-learning about dysphagia for stroke rehabilitation nurses. BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a potentially life-threatening problem that compromises quality of life. In many countries, nurses play a crucial role in supporting the management of patients with swallowing problems, yet the literature reports a need for training. DESIGN: A single-group, pre- and post-study with mixed methods. METHODS: Each blended e-learning session comprised a needs analysis, e-learning programmes, practical skills about modifying fluids and action planning to transfer learning into practice. Participants were the population of registered nurses (n = 22) and healthcare assistants (n = 10) on a stroke rehabilitation ward in a large, teaching hospital in England between August 2010-March 2011. Data collection comprised observation (34 hours), questionnaires administered at four time points to examine change in attitude, knowledge and practice, and estimating the resource use cost for the service. Nonparametric tests and content analysis were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: All participants achieved a nationally recognised level of competence. The learning effect was evident on the post- and follow-up measures, with some items of dysphagia knowledge and attitude achieving significance at the p ≤ 0·05 level. The most common self-reported changes in practice related to medicines management, thickening fluids and oral hygiene. The resource use cost was estimated at £2688 for 108 hours training. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace-based, blended e-learning was an acceptable, cost effective way of delivering essential clinical knowledge and skills about dysphagia. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Dysphagia should be viewed as a patient safety issue because of the risks of malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration pneumonia. As such, it is pertinent to many members of the interdisciplinary team. Consideration should be given to including dysphagia management in initial education and continuing professional development programmes.

%X The nursing profession needs to have a greater appreciation of how techniques such as Citizens' Juries can be used in nursing research. This paper explains the concept of Citizens' Juries and how it is being used as a form of social research, that can simultaneously increase public participation in policy making. Participation has become a key component of the discourse in policy making, and public participation initiatives can be one way of bridging the democratic deficit. For nursing, Citizens' Juries offer a way of discovering lay people's considered judgment on key policy issues, while also providing a potentially powerful platform for citizens to express their concerns and priorities, thereby influencing the services they receive. A Citizens' Jury brings together a small group of people over a period of time and presents them with a policy question. The jurors listen to expert witnesses, examine the evidence, deliberate on the issues and arrive at a policy decision or set of recommendations. In this paper we argue that any ordinary person given the opportunity, enough time and the necessary resources can make decisions about complex policy matters. Key findings from two Citizens' Juries on genetics in Wales are offered as case studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X This multisite study examined the impact of multiple-patient simulation experiences on the development of nursing students' patient safety competencies in the final semester of their baccalaureate or associate degree nursing program. It extends the Jeffries Simulation Model by investigating how the student factors of tolerance for ambiguity and self-reported grade point average (GPA), in addition to age, relate to the outcomes of simulation. The study showed that students' safety competencies improved significantly from the first to the second simulation. Student age, GPA, and tolerance of ambiguity were not significantly correlated to the students' demonstration of patient safety competencies. The findings of this study contribute to the science of nursing education by providing evidence for nursing educators related to the impact of multiple-patient simulations on improving and documenting students' patient safety competencies before their entry into the workforce. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

%X Delirium is a common, serious and potentially preventable problem. It is argued here that knowledge and skills for effective assessment and treatment of delirium cannot be considered 'specialist'. Rather, delirium is a problem that requires a healthcare team approach to assessing patients, identifying risks or symptoms and reducing precipitating factors. Research from the preceding decade suggests that the clinical reality is falling short of this ideal with the result that many cases of delirium go undetected and many precipitating factors are not reduced where this is indeed possible. This presents a challenge for the education of nursing and medical students and for the development of qualified staff in practice. The current paper outlines an educational approach, e-learning, which increases access for learners, integrates knowledge and skill development and promotes active, problem-based learning. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

%X A recent report made a number of recommendations about the safe use of midazolam sedation, including the importance of an organisational policy for sedation and the appointment of a senior clinician (usually an anaesthetist) with overall responsibility [1]. Overdose of midazolam during sedation was added to the Department of Health list of 'Never Events' in 2011. This audit was performed to assess the quality of cardiologist-administered sedation in Derriford Hospital and to assess the effect of an anaesthetist-designed and led program of sedation training. Methods Standards were defined in three areas of sedation practice: documentation; personnel; and safe conduct of sedation. For documentation, the recording of patient fasting status and allergies was audited. The standards for personnel were that there should be a member of staff dedicated to monitoring the patient and that an advanced life support provider should be present. The standards for sedation conduct were that flumazenil should not be administered to any patients, that oxygen should be used only when indicated and that there should be ECG and oxygen saturation monitoring. Initial data collection took place between March and April 2010, following which a compulsory program of multidisciplinary seminar- based training was conducted for all staff (including nursing and ancillary staff) involved in sedation in the cardiology department. The audit was repeated in May 2012. Results We observed an improvement from our initial audit in terms of administration of flumazenil, patient monitoring and documentation (Table 1). (Table Presented) Discussion Significant improvements were seen. The program is now part of the mandatory training for all staff involved in sedation and has recently been converted to an e-learning package.

%X BACKGROUND: Many people with epilepsy report experiencing psychological difficulties such as anxiety, depression and neuropsychological deficits including memory problems. Research has shown that these difficulties are often present not only for people with chronic epilepsy but also for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Despite this, there are very few published interventions that detail means to help people with newly diagnosed epilepsy manage these problems. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess possible psychological and neuropsychological interventions for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 30 June 2015: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), SCOPUS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). SELECTION CRITERIA: This review includes all randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort controlled studies, and prospective before and after studies which include psychological or neuropsychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. We excluded studies that included people with epilepsy and any other psychological disorder or neurological condition. We excluded studies carried out which recruited only children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedure expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two authors independently completed data extraction and risk of bias analysis. The results of this were cross-checked and third author resolved any discrepancies. In the event of missing data, we contacted the study authors. Meta-analysis was not completed due to differences in the intervention and outcomes reported in the two studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included two randomised controlled trials assessing psychological interventions for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. One study assessed a cognitive behavioural intervention (CBI) in an adolescent population. This study was rated as low quality. One study assessed a specialist nurse intervention in an adult population. This study was rating as very low quality.We rated one study as having unclear risk of bias and one study as having high risk of bias.The CBI study indicated that this intervention could significantly reduce depressive symptoms in people with subthreshold depressive disorder. However, the study assessing the effectiveness of a nurse intervention found no significant benefit for depressive symptoms,but did find that in individuals with the least knowledge of epilepsy, a nurse intervention could increase their knowledge of epilepsy scores. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis was not possible as we identified only two studies and they utilised different interventions and outcome measures.Previous research has highlighted the impact of psychological and neuropsychological difficulties experienced by people with epilepsy and the negative effect this has on their quality of life. The main finding of this review is that there is a paucity of research assessing possible neuropsychological and psychological interventions for adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

%X AIM: To reflect on the potential of blogs to enhance engagement with research, create a dialogue between researchers and nurses, and provide feedback to researchers. BACKGROUND: Blogs can create opportunities to share ideas, provide an arena for interaction, and rapidly and effectively initiate dialogue and feedback on research. DATA SOURCES: This paper draws on analysis of comments on a blog post about the findings of a peer-reviewed journal article. REVIEW METHODS: Content analysis of web blog discussion. DISCUSSION: It is unclear if the readers of the blog would have accessed this article any other way. Therefore, posting research findings on a blog can engage a new audience of nurses and provide a way to feed back comments and responses to researchers. This highlights the potential value of online forums for 'knowledge translation' and draws attention to virtual collegiality, which can provide a way for nurses in diverse locations to share their experiences and ideas, and gain support and information. CONCLUSION: Research findings were brought to life through the participation of blog commenters, who validated findings reported in the research. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE/RESEARCH: Given the rapid uptake of social media, it is inevitable that it will become an increasingly important feature of research. This paper demonstrates how the nexus can occur between more formal social enquiry and less formal engagement in critique and knowledge translation. The authors argue that the rapid uptake and exchange of information through social media can provide an indication of the social relevance of the research.

%X BACKGROUND: Good communication is required in cancer care. To provide qualitative cancer care many topics (such as diagnosis, treatment, recovery, relapse) need to be discussed with the patients. However, caregivers education focuses mainly on technical aspects of care. The Cédric Hè lè Institute - Flemish institute for psychosocial oncology - coordinates training programs in psycho-oncology. In 2010 CHi was designated by the Belgian Government to develop a course in communication for 150 professionals working in cancer care programs. METHOD: CHi developed a 30h training program for nurses, paramedics and doctors. The program offers a variety of theoretical models, and integrates many interactive methods such as (self-) reflection, exercises, homework assignments and role-plays. These methods create good conditions to teach communication skills, to practice skills and to integrate these into clinical practice. The focus of the training is on the patient and his family (coping, illness perceptions, communication with family members, conflict handling), the teams within which we operate (team support) and our own functioning (self-care). RESULTS: 250 Oncology professionals presented their candidacy. CHi selected 162 professionals: 70 Doctors, 76 (specialist-)nurses, 12 social workers en 4 other paramedics. Each course was given by two trainers, this to allow maximum interaction. Evaluations were very positive. Professionals feel more competent at work after attending the course. They are more aware of their communication, and reflect more. This makes them feel more confident in difficult situations. The trainees also highly appreciated the interactions with colleagues from other disciplines and hospitals. In answer, The Belgian Government decided to re-invest in training for 150 professionals in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The communication training contributes to the aim of the Chi to improve psychosocial care of cancer patients in Flanders. Studies show that effective communication of health care providers improves the welfare of their patients, but also their own wellbeing. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The communication program is evidence based: the theoretical framework is build on scientific research in communication in oncology. Clinical practice is implemented in the interactive modules. The trainers are all working within the oncology setting and draw material from their own working setting. Trainees bring in clinical cases, difficulties of the daily work, and results of home work assignments and are trained to implement the evidence into the daily practice. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Trainees improved their communication skills. The interactive methodology provides a good basis for transferring these skills into clinical practice. Not only this leads to a better care of cancer patients and their relatives. Research shows that training in communication reduces the risk of burnout. The contacts and exchange of experience between different onco-disciplines and different hospitals was also very valuable. The intra- and interdisciplinary networking creates a good platform for these professionals.

%X BACKGROUND: Within the Belgian National Cancer Plan 320 extra psychologists, nurses and social workers were recruited. This increased the need for exchange and sharing experiences in Belgium. In answer to these needs, the Cédric Hèle institute (CHi) wants to create a secure online community, with access to up-to-date information, training materials and scientific research. The CHi trainings and workshops confirm the need for exchange of knowledge and good practices between health care providers, beyond the borders of hospitals and organizations. METHOD: CHi conducted a qualitative research with 100 onco-professionals to discover the need for an online community. We developed a survey. Results show a large support base for the community, beyond the borders of disciplines and institutions. There is little to no experience in the use of communities. Many professionals use the internet on a regular basis to search for work related information. Almost all professionals were in favor of an accessible online platform in psycho oncology. In addition CHi composed a core group with representatives from each discipline (oncologist, psychologist, social worker, nurse) in order to specify and further develop functionalities. RESULTS: There is a large support base, both amongst professionals working in the hospitals as in the home care for cancer patients. Major focus is ease of use, the community shouldn't require prior knowledge or experience with social media. It is a secure platform, with clearly visible profiles, and close quality control. In terms of functionalities, there is a need to a clear who's who, a news feed, a forum for the exchange of study materials and discussions, calendar with useful events and training courses, a research track in which the bridge between researchers and clinicians is simplified, elearning possibilities. CONCLUSIONS: An online community is a relatively new phenomenon within the healthcare industry. A search for similar initiatives provided little to no sites. CHi would mainly expand the interactive part of the site and give people the chance to strengthen their working skills. The CHi community wants to cultivate better psychosocial care for cancer patients, in a secure environment. All relevant, up-to-date information in our field will be there to consult. To this end, we set up cooperation initiatives with universities, keyplayers and experts in Psycho-Oncology. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The community aims to connect the clinical world with scientific researchers. There will be more attention to implementation of research results in the daily practice. The community will facilitate contacts between researchers and clinicians making participation in research more accessible. Researchers will have clearer view of research questions, relevant to the field. The community will help to establish and realize multicentre studies. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The clinical implications are 3-fold: to scientific research, offering access to relevant highquality information, create a platform for continuous professional development. Researchers can announce and publish their research results directly to professionals, which will facilitate implementation in the daily practice. In addition, access to quality information for onco-professionals will be simplified, bundled in one place. The meeting with colleagues will respond to the need to exchange.

%X Objectives and study: Nutrition training is an essential part of fellowship in paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition (PGHN) as specified in the nutrition syllabus offered by ESPGHAN. We sought to evaluate nutrition training among fellows and professionals specialising in paediatric gastroenterology (GI). Methods: Between 2/2014 and 5/2015, an ESPGHAN-wide call by email attracted participation by 56 PGHN fellows from 26 countries. We contacted trainee members of ESPGHAN and fellows who attended ESPGHAN activities like summer schools, in sum approximately 250 persons. An electronic survey comprised 17 questions regarding general information, year of graduation from medical school, paediatric GI training programs offered by the local hospital and/or national PGHAN organisation, time schedule of the local/national PGHAN education, composition of the local multidisciplinary nutrition team, current training opportunities in their local centres and countries, and nutrition topics covered during training. Results: Among 56 fellows in the field of PGHN, 36% had already completed their training, whereas 54% were still in training. 39 fellows (71%) were participating in a local GI training program. 33 fellows (59%) were enrolled in a national PGHN fellowship program leading to subspecialty certification. The training of 24 fellows (43%) was entirely devoted to paediatric GI. Another 25 (45%) spent between >50-99% in this field. A multidisciplinary nutrition team was available to 59% of fellows (without exception, those enrolled in an official PGHN programme). These teams included dietitians (88%), fellows (84%), consultants (81%), specialist parenteral nutrition nurses (44%), psychologists (46%), and pharmacists (44%). 16 fellows (33%) used the recently published ESPGHAN syllabus for nutrition and 29 (60%) had attended a nutrition course (ESPGHAN-directed or other). Few used e-learning nutrition modules (16%) but many were willing to use e-learning modules in the future (70%); many asked for future ESPGHAN nutrition summer schools (84%) and some requested long-distancelearning nutrition programs (51%). Most frequently covered during training were the topics of diagnosis and investigation of a patient with failure to thrive (63%), cystic fibrosis (43%), indications and contraindications for commencing enteral feeds (43%), benefits and risks of enteral and parenteral nutrition (43%), infant feeding (37%), and coeliac disease (34%). Conclusion: This survey shows that nutrition training in Europe is variable and that the ESPGHAN nutrition syllabus is not yet implemented Europe-wide. ESPGHAN should motivate all individual trainers to apply the ESPGHAN nutrition syllabus. Future e-learning modules and summer schools may provide concomitant training.

%X Introduction: Insulin use is an effective method of managing hyperglycaemia but prescribing and management errors are common. AUKaudit revealed3,881wrong dose incidents andsevendeathsover a 6-year period (National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), 2010). In response to this the NPSA and NHS Diabetes launched a tri-phase educational initiative aimed at reducing errors, including rapidresponse reports sent to all hospital and community trusts, written recommendations for insulin use, and an e-learning module and assessment. Aim: Toimprove the knowledge of all healthcareprofessionals (HCPs) in the safe use of insulin through e-learning. Method: A safe use of insulin e-learning module commissioned by NHS Diabetes and the NPSA was developed by a hospital trust and piloted by multidisciplinary HCPs from UK hospital and community settings.Themodule launched in June 2010 used establishedweb-based contacts to promote access. Reminders were sent to those not completing within 3 months. The number, type, workplace location and percentage of those accessing and completing the module were audited weekly to assess uptake. Results: Four-month data revealed 8,675 registrations from a wide range of HCPs with 55 per cent (n = 4,808) successfully completing. Those completing included consultants (3 per cent, n = 151), general practitioners (3 per cent, n = 135), junior doctors (16 per cent, n = 779), hospital nurses (34 per cent, n = 1,609), community nurses (15 per cent, n = 702), practice nurses (2 per cent, n = 116), diabetes specialistnurses (4per cent,n = 200) andother professions (23per cent, n = 1,202). Conclusion: E-learning provides an accessible method of education delivery to large multidisciplinary populations; module efficacy can be audited annually through collection and comparison of locally and nationally reported insulin errors.

%X This study sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying the blended learning program that combines the advantages of face-to-face(FTF) learning and e-learning. The blended learning program was developed by the authors and implemented for 4 weeks. 56 senior nursing students were recruited at a university in Korea. Significant improvement was noted in learning achievement. No significant differences were noted between FTF and web-based learning in learning motivation. Learning satisfaction and students' experience in taking this course revealed some positive effects of blended learning. The use of blended learning program for undergraduate nursing students will provide an effective learning model.

%X Background Knowledge among critical care nurses and their adherence to evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia is reported to be low. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of human patient simulation (HPS) education in the nursing management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Methods A prospective, parallel, randomized controlled trial with repeated measurements was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Finland from February-October 2012. Thirty critical care nurses were allocated evenly to intervention and control groups (n = 15 each). The effectiveness of HPS education was evaluated through the validated Ventilator Bundle Questionnaire and Ventilator Bundle Observation Schedule at baseline and repeated twice-after the clinical and simulation settings, respectivley. Results After HPS education, the average skill scores (Ventilator Bundle Observation Schedule) in the intervention group increased significantly (46.8%-60.0% of the total score) in the final postintervention observation. In the average skill scores, a linear mixed model identified significant time (Pt <.001) and group (Pg =.03) differences and time-group interactions (Pt*g =.02) between the study groups after the HPS education. In contrast, the model did not identify any significant change over time (Pt =.29) or time-group interactions (Pt =.69) between groups in average knowledge scores (Ventilator Bundle Questionnaire). Conclusions Our study identified significant transfer of learned skills to clinical practice following HPS education but no influence on the level of participants' factual knowledge.

%X Objective: To describe health workers' perceptions of a quality improvement (QI) intervention that focused on improving institutional childbirth services in primary health facilities in Southern Tanzania. Design: A qualitative design was applied using indepth interviews with health workers. Setting: This study involved the Ruangwa District Reproductive and Child Health Department, 11 dispensaries and 2 health centres in rural Southern Tanzania. Participants: 4 clinical officers, 5 nurses and 6 medical attendants from different health facilities were interviewed. Results: The healthcare providers reported that the QI intervention improved their skills, capacity and confidence in providing counselling and use of a partograph during labour. The face-to-face QI workshops, used as a platform to refresh their knowledge on maternal and newborn health and QI methods, facilitated peer learning, networking and standardisation of care provision. The onsite follow-up visits were favoured by healthcare providers because they gave the opportunity to get immediate help, learn how to perform tasks in practice and be reminded of what they had learnt. Implementation of parallel interventions focusing on similar indicators was mentioned as a challenge that led to duplication of work in terms of data collection and reporting. District supervisors involved in the intervention showed interest in taking over the implementation; however, funding remained a major obstacle. Conclusions: Healthcare workers highlighted the usefulness of applying a QI approach to improve maternal and newborn health in rural settings. QI programmes need careful coordination at district level in order to reduce duplication of work.

%X The incidence of hip fractures increased from 3.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1966 to 5.1 in 1986 for persons more than 50 years old. The incidence almost doubled in persons more than 80 years old, from 13.3 to 25.6 per 1,000. The proportional increase was largest in men with cervical fractures. A higher incidence was found in the city compared to the rural area. The city of Lund had a lower incidence in comparison with larger cities, such as Stockholm, Göteborg and Uppsala. The early rehabilitation at home of hip fracture patients in cooperation with primary health care, rendered good results and a low consumption of resources, compared to continued care at the Orthopedic Department or in a nursing home. About 60 per cent of the patients returned directly to their own home. Most of them regained, within four months, their former capacity of daily life, in spite of their hip fracture and high age. Patients with hip fractures reported more signs of diseases, lower capacity for managing their daily life and were more often afraid of falling than the controls. Most falls, 75 per cent, preceding the fracture, occurred during walking or when rising from or sitting down on a chair. Two thirds of the hip fracture patients had fallen sideways. A test battery for assessing standing balance on a computerized force platform was evaluated. Postural sway in healthy subjects indicated that age and sex were important, when analysing the results. Men and older subjects had larger postural sway than women and younger subjects, respectively. Middle-aged patients with a previous hip fracture showed larger postural sway (= lower balance capacity), lower perceived balance and a lower walking speed than healthy controls. Eighteen 70-year-old women trained their postural control for five weeks. They had significantly better results in the tests after the training period than the controls. These balance tests are simple and applicable in clinical practice. Training of postural control might prevent some hip fractures, which is of the utmost importance both for the elderly person and society.

%X The purpose of this study is to describe the curriculum development and introduction of problem-based learning pedagogy (PBL) in the undergraduate nursing education at Savonia University of Applied Sciences in Iisalmi unit. The main points to be described are the integration of PBL and e-learning methods and nursing students' learning outcomes in clinical practice. PBL pedagogy develops information literacy skills, critical thinking and evidence-based nursing skills, communication, co-operation and team working skills, problem solving and self-assessment skills. Integration of PBL and e-learning methods in clinical practice has developed nursing competencies, reflection of learning and peer support of nursing students. The most important results are peer support, feedback and a teacher's encouragement when using e-learning methods.

%X Background: It is common clinical practice to follow patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) for several years following their curative surgery or adjuvant therapy, or both. Despite this widespread practice, there is considerable controversy about how often patients should be seen, what tests should be performed, and whether these varying strategies have any significant impact on patient outcomes. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and first updated in 2007. Objectives: To assess the effects of intensive follow-up for patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer treated with curative intent. Search methods: For this update, we searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to May 20th, 2016), Embase (1974 to May 20th, 2016), CINAHL (1981 to May 20th, 2016), and Science Citation Index (1900 to May 20th, 2016). We also searched reference lists of articles, and handsearched the Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (2011 to 2014). In addition, we searched the following trials registries (May 20th, 2016): ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We further contacted study authors. No language or publication restrictions were applied to the search strategies. Selection criteria: We included only randomised controlled trials comparing different follow-up strategies for participants with non-metastatic CRC treated with curative intent. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently determined trial eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed methodological quality. Main results: We studied 5403 participants enrolled in 15 studies. (We included two new studies in this second update.) Although the studies varied in setting (general practitioner (GP)-led, nurse-led, or surgeon-led) and "intensity" of follow-up, there was very little inconsistency in the results. Overall survival: we found no evidence of a statistical effect with intensive follow-up (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.02; I2 = 4%; P = 0.41; high-quality evidence). There were 1098 deaths among 4786 participants enrolled in 12 studies. Colorectal cancer-specific survival: this did not differ with intensive follow-up (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; I2 = 0%; P = 0.45; moderate-quality evidence). There were 432 colorectal cancer deaths among 3769 participants enrolled in seven studies. Relapse-free survival: we found no statistical evidence of effect with intensive follow-up (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; I2 = 5%; P = 0.39; moderate-quality evidence). There were 1416 relapses among 5253 participants enrolled in 14 studies. Salvage surgery with curative intent: this was more frequent with intensive follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.56; I2 = 31%; P = 0.14; high-quality evidence). There were 457 episodes of salvage surgery in 5157 participants enrolled in 13 studies. Interval (symptomatic) recurrences: these were less frequent with intensive follow-up (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.86; I2 = 66%; P = 0.007; moderate-quality evidence). Three hundred and seventy-six interval recurrences were reported in 3933 participants enrolled in seven studies. Intensive follow-up did not appear to affect quality of life, anxiety, nor depression (reported in three studies). Harms from colonoscopies did not differ with intensive follow-up (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.11 to 40.17; moderate-quality evidence). In two studies, there were seven colonoscopic complications in 2112 colonoscopies. Authors' conclusions: The results of our review suggest that there is no overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Although more participants were treated with salvage surgery with curative intent in the intensive follow-up group, this was not associated with improved survival. Harms related to intensive follow-up and salvage therapy were not well reported.

%X The most common cardiac examination ordered by physicians is the 12 lead ECG, frequently obtained with a computerized recording device that not only provides the ECG tracing but, may also provide the diagnosis. In the past, only persons working in the ECG laboratory were allowed to perform a 12 lead ECG on a patient. Today, however, this task has been delegated to a variety of health professionals, including registered nurses, licensed practice nurses, and even nursing assistants in some health care facilities. New nurses are taught the skill of obtaining a 12 lead ECG during their initial hospital orientation. Because of this, it is not uncommon to have staff development nurses teaching groups of health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG content and skill as many as 5 times in 1 week. For delivery of repetitive content, the use of an interactive CD ROM can be very cost effective. Many health care institutions purchase commercially made CD ROM products, while elsewhere nurse educators develop their own. An interactive CD ROM based on the principles of best practice in education and using embedded virtual reality, was designed by the author to teach nurses, students, and other health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG. This article will: 1) describe the interactive CD ROM reality as a teaching methodology; 2) discuss the preliminary evaluation of learning outcomes using CD ROM as the instructional method; and 3) describe the applications interactive CD ROMs may have in nursing practice and education.

%X Many U.S. colleges and universities are discovering innovative and exciting ways of using information technology to promote the process of teaching and learning and to extend education to new populations of students. Nurse educators in academia and service settings are developing interactive e-learning programs or courses to meet this need, and to either enhance practice concepts and basic skills or orient new associates to the clinical organization. In continuing education programs, students need flexibility and convenience to concurrently meet their personal and academic goals, and consumer demand for online instruction is increasing. The challenge is to prepare a comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective e-learning course to meet educational standards and competencies. To meet this challenge, an instructional design model, the Hyperlearning Model, was developed based on Chickering and Gamson's principles of best practices in undergraduate education, to guide the development of an online course for basic critical care content. In this article, I describe the creation and testing of an instructional design model for developing content in this online course.

%X The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM with traditional methods of teaching the skill of performing a 12-lead ECG. A randomized pre/posttest experimental design was used. Seventy-seven baccalaureate nursing students in a required, senior-level critical-care course at a large midwestern university were recruited for the study. Two teaching methods were compared. The traditional method included a self-study module, a brief lecture and demonstration by an instructor, and hands-on experience using a plastic manikin and a real 12-lead ECG machine in the learning laboratory. The second method covered the same content using an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM embedded with virtual reality and supplemented with a self-study module. There were no significant (p < .05) baseline differences in pretest scores between the two groups and no significant differences by group in cognitive gains, student satisfaction with their learning method, or perception of self-efficacy in performing the skill. Overall results indicated that both groups were satisfied with their instructional method and were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly on a live, simulated patient. This evaluation study is a beginning step to assess new and potentially more cost-effective teaching methods and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors, including the transfer of skill acquisition via a computer simulation to a real patient.

%X An essential outcome of professional practice environments is the provision of high-quality, safe nursing care. To mitigate the quality and safety chasm, nursing leadership at St. Michael's Hospital undertook a strategic plan to enhance the nursing professional practice environment. This case study outlines the development of the strategic planning process: the driving forces (platform); key stakeholders (process and players); vision, guiding principles, strategic directions, framework for action and accountability (plan); lessons learned (pearls); and next steps to moving forward the vision, strategic directions and accountability mechanisms (passion and perseverance).

%X With the healthcare system in a state of flux, nursing education faces many challenges. Nursing faculty must design a dynamic curriculum that deals with the explosion of information, the complexity of the healthcare system, and optimal patient outcomes while addressing the diverse expectations of learners. Inclusion of information management and interactive technology facilitates learner engagement promoting critical thinking and improving clinical judgment. This paper details the faculty's vision for an ubiquitous information technology curricula, highlighting an undergraduate informatics course, use of a personal response system, and integration of human patient simulations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The use of computerized technology is rapidly growing in the classroom and in healthcare. An emerging computer technology strategy for nursing education is the use of virtual reality simulation. This computer-based three-dimensional educational tool simulates real-life patient experiences in a risk-free environment, allows for repeated practice sessions, requires clinical decision making, exposes students to diverse patient conditions, provides immediate feedback, and is portable. The purpose of this article was to review the importance of virtual reality simulation as a computerized teaching strategy. In addition, a project to explore readiness of nursing faculty at one major Midwestern university for the use of virtual reality simulation as a computerized teaching strategy is described where faculty thought virtual reality simulation would increase students' knowledge of an intravenous line insertion procedure. Faculty who practiced intravenous catheter insertion via virtual reality simulation expressed a wide range of learning experiences from using virtual reality simulation that is congruent with the literature regarding the barriers to student learning. Innovative teaching strategies, such as virtual reality simulation, address barriers of increasing patient acuity, high student-to-faculty ratio, patient safety concerns from faculty, and student anxiety and can offer rapid feedback tostudents.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Access to specialty care in the Community Living Center (CLC) is logistically challenging for the patients, clinicians and the health system. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): Electronic consultations (E-consults) offer referring clinicians specialist input on questions addressable by chart review. Econsults are associated with increased access to subspecialty care, patient satisfaction and clinical efficiency. The landscape of E-consult use in subacute care has not been well characterized. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): The VA Boston Healthcare System is a tertiary care facility consisting of 3 geographically dispersed main campuses and 5 community-based outpatient clinics. The CLC is a 110-bed nursing home that provides transitional (skilled nursing or rehabilitation), palliative/hospice and long-term care. The CLC is located more than 20 miles from the medical/surgical acute care services andmost subspecialty clinics. In the current model of care, sub-specialists do not consult at the bedside but provide expertise by either scheduled outpatient consults or through E-consults. E-consults can provide clinicians with decision-making support to improve clinical care. The process provides access to specialists that may avoid unnecessary travel, decrease amount of admin time to arrange appointments, and limit the disruption in rehabilitation services for patients for whom in-person evaluation is unnecessary. In an effort to improve access to specialty care, VA nationwide has encouraged the use of E-consults, which are asynchronous providerprovider consults on a shared electronic health record (EHR) platform. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): E-consults were introduced to the VA Boston CLC in 2011. This study characterizes all E-consults in the VA Boston CLC since 2011 by specialty, type of question and disease type (within each specialty). Type of question was categorized as: Diagnosis, Prognosis, Management, Self-Improvement and Request for Direction. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TOSTATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): From2011 to 2016, 474 E-consults were requested from the following specialties: Infectious Diseases (26%), Endocrinology (13%), Cardiology (12%), Hematology (8%), Renal (5%), Urology (4%), Gastroenterology (4%), Psychiatry (4%), Pulmonary (4%). The annual number of E-consults requested from the CLC grew from 14 in 2011 to 141 in 2016. The median time to response within the top ten requested specialties was between 2.28 and 23.95 h. Majority of requests (67.5%) were focused on management followed by diagnosis/work up (23.5%). KEYLESSONS FORDISSEMINATION(WHAT CANOTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): E-consult use in our subacute facility has seen steady increase since introduction with the majority focused on management issues. E- consults enable the avoidance of significant logistic and administrative burden of in-person consults and rapid clinical decision-making support (time to response less than 24 h). Future evaluation includes type of E-consult converted to live visit, efficacy of patient care and clinician satisfaction. This evaluation shows the increasing use and importance of E-consults for access to specialist care for patients in a subacute setting.

%X Learning manual skills is a fundamental part of health care education, and motor, sensory and cognitive learning processes are essential aspects of professional development. Simulator training has been shown to enhance factors that facilitate motor and cognitive learning. The present study aimed to investigate the students' experiences and thoughts about their learning through simulation skills training. The study was designed for an educational setting at a clinical skills centre. Ten third-year undergraduate nursing students performed urethral catheterisation, using the virtual reality simulator UrecathVision™, which has haptic properties. The students practised in pairs. Each session was videotaped and the video was used to stimulate recall in subsequent interviews. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis from interviews resulted in three themes: what the students learn, how the students learn, and the simulator's contribution to the students' learning. Students learned manual skills, how to perform the procedure, and professional behaviour. They learned by preparing, watching, practising and reflecting. The simulator contributed by providing opportunities for students to prepare for the skills training, to see anatomical structures, to feel resistance, and to become aware of their own performance ability. The findings show that the students related the task to previous experiences, used sensory information, tested themselves and practised techniques in a hands-on fashion, and reflected in and on action. The simulator was seen as a facilitator to learning the manual skills. The study design, with students working in pairs combined with video recording, was found to enhance opportunities for reflection. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

%X Current understanding of brain plasticity has lead to new approaches in ischemic stroke rehabilitation. Stroke units that combine good medical and nursing care with task-oriented intense training in an environment that provides confidence, stimulation and motivation significantly improve outcome. Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are applied in rehabilitation of motor function. The long-term effect, optimal way of stimulation and possibly efficacy in cognitive rehabilitation need evaluation. Methods based on multisensory integration of motor, cognitive, and perceptual processes including action observation, mental training, and virtual reality are being tested. Different approaches of intensive aphasia training are described. Recent data on intensive melodic intonation therapy indicate that even patients with very severe non-fluent aphasia can regain speech through homotopic white matter tract plasticity. Music therapy is applied in motor and cognitive rehabilitation. To avoid the confounding effect of spontaneous improvement, most trials are preformed ≥3months post stroke. Randomized controlled trials starting earlier after strokes are needed. More attention should be given to stroke heterogeneity, cognitive rehabilitation, and social adjustment and to genetic differences, including the role of BDNF polymorphism in brain plasticity. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

%X Training based on an apprenticeship model has been used effectively by the medical profession for centuries. As technology has progressed, many different tools and techniques have been deployed to provide added value to the training process. In recent years, one of the most exciting developments has been the use of immersive virtual environments to provide structured and flexible training scenarios. Hospitals can already purchase bespoke systems from companies such as Symbionix (Tel Aviv, Israel), Immersion Medical, and Mentice. The first generation of medial simulators targeted laparoscopy procedures but training solutions for other fields of medicine are also starting to appear. Great efforts have also been made to try to increase the fidelity of medical simulation to approach that of training on real patients. However, we are still a long way from replicating the real life environment. This presentation provides an update on the latest technology being used to create a medical training simulator, and highlights issues and trends identified by the research team at Bangor and our collaborators in the CRaIVE (Collaborators in Radiological Interventions in Virtual Environments) network. The impact of advances in software algorithms will be discussed, together with the constraints and advantages of using offthe- shelf hardware components. It is important to note that building a simulator is a multi-disciplinary process. And equally important for success are contributions from experts in computer science, task analysis, validation studies, and guidance from subject matter experts. Case studies will be presented with a focus on the various approaches to deliver training environments for interventional radiology procedures such as the Seldinger technique. The presentation will end with a forward look at the next generation of medical training simulators and summarise the key challenges and future directions of this technology. We predict that the next generation of virtual environments will closely replicate the real world operating room. The trainee interventionalist, anaesthetist, nurses, and other treatment room staff will participate in a collaborative environment that will support both team and individual tasks. Mockups of all of the equipment used in real life will be provided with a high fidelity virtual patient replacing the real patient. One enabling technology in achieving this will be new display technology such as interactive autostereoscopic displays, integrated with a haptics user interface. As well as training applications, diagnosis and surgical navigation will benefit from the latest technology advancements in virtual environments. An interesting development in the latter domain is the use augmented reality (AR) so that 3D graphics techniques can be used to augment the reality as we see it with digital content. For example, the view through a surgical microscope can be augmented with information about the location of delicate structures that are normally out of sight below the visible surface. Eventually, ultrasound guided needle puncture could be replaced by an AR system where a 3D rendering of the target anatomy is overlaid onto the actual patient. We are in a critical period for the future development of medical training simulators. There are certainly procedures where a VE can already provide added value to the training process. The price performance of the processing hardware and other components needed has improved dramatically and software algorithms are becoming more sophisticated and efficient. We are witnessing a significant jump up in the number of solutions available from research laboratories and companies. However, there is still a long way to go before the fidelity of training on a real patient can be matched. It is important that comprehensive validation studies accompany any technological development and that full advantage is taken of multi-disciplinary research to achieve the next generation of medical training simulation.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): In North Central Aurora, 45 % of women over 20 lack a high school education and 15 % of children are born to mothers under 20, unfortunate facts given the myriad of independent medical and social health providers servicing the area. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): The Fields Foundation's Clinical Community Coordination Program's primary objective is to help these young families and at-risk youth to access existing services and overcome the burdens of poor health literacy, lack of awareness of this support structure, and lack of coordination amongst providers. Secondary objectives are to improve sexual health literacy and reduce pregnancy rates amongst youth. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): The program is administered by an independent community organization and revolves around a community-based nurse care coordinator overseeing 2 tiers of community health workers (CHWs). Tier 1 is a broadly available “street team” available in person or via social media to provide intermittent education and service coordination to a large pool of potential patients. Tier 2 is based upon continuous family-based care relationships, with CHWs and care coordinator navigating and interfacing with multiple providers to ensure care access, understanding of care goals, and appropriate service utilization. We have developed a family-based documentation technique that reflects our holistic recognition that a person's chief complaint is not always a medical issue, but may rather involve domestic issues, food insecurity, legal trouble, etc. In lieu of the complexity of the community's health and social welfare systems, this intervention must be grassroots-led, rather than connected to any one institution or provider network. Our partners, including the Piton Foundation, Colorado Children's Health Access Program, and the University of Colorado School of Public Health and Departments of General Internal Medicine and Community Pediatrics, support this approach. Tier 1 CHWs have already begun providing care, andwe are currently developing a problembased learning curriculum to train Tier 2 CHWs, with a goal to begin enrolling continuity patients in autumn 2013. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSSQUALITATIVE AND/ORQUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Our metrics include utilization data, health indicators including pregnancy rates, and markers of financial and social well-being. We will compare these metrics to those of nearby control communities, similar to the approach employed assessing the Earth Institute's Millennium Villages Project. Metrics are coordinated with our partner institutions and organizations. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE “FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED”): To date, we have completed a full needs assessment in the form of a PhotoVoice project, as well as a survey of sexual health knowledge and attitudes amongst local high school students. These assessments identify a need for holistic care coordination, as well as a strong community and political will to implement such a design. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Our results will be generalizable to other communities lacking an inclusive safety net care structure, demonstrating that community-based care coordination provides cost-effective, culturally appropriate care that improves both health utilization and outcomes. This evidence will ultimately support the policy goal of primary care reimbursement reform by the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. Finally, this project provides educational benefit, demonstrating the potential for community-based participatory research within a primary care medicine residency program.

%X Most families can access a range of health information and advice. Information and advice sources often include nurses, the Internet, social media, books, as well as family and friends. While the immediate aim may be to find information, it can also be to assist with parenting skills, solve parenting problems or as part of decision-making processes about their child's health. These processes are strongly influenced by the parent's level of health literacy. Health literacy describes a person's capacity to obtain and utilize health related information. Although there are numerous health literacy definitions all have clearly defined steps. These steps are: obtaining relevant information; then understanding this information; and finally being able to use the information to achieve the expected outcome. Previous research has linked low levels of parental health literacy with poorer child health outcomes. Given this link, increasing health literacy levels would be advantageous for both families and health services. Nurses working with families are in a position to support the family to increase their health literacy through the use of a variety of strategies. This article outlines how health literacy can influence the way parents seek help when they are concerned about child health issues, the relevance of parental health literacy for nurses and suggests some tools that could be used to support the increase of health literacy.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Considerable amount of time is spent processing out patient messages, going back and forth with patients and healthcare team members to obtain needed information, and then additional time trying to track a patient down for resolution of their message. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1) Add value to patient non-medication refill messaging process through standardization 2) Improve satisfaction with non-medication refill messaging DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Setting: Outpatient clinic with an integrated electronic health record (EHR) and personal health record (PHR) with ongoing value based care initiatives to create change through rigorous quality improvement projects Intervention: Standardization of non-medication refill patient messaging Significance: Impacts all team members: medical secretaries, medical assistants, nurses, clinical pharmacists, physician assistants, and physicians; refills already standardized Preplanning: Generated potential causes for wasteful time spent processing patient messages and why no standardization existed. Made a decision matrix and asked people to help us identify top root causes. Created a current and future process map of how non-medication refill messages were being handled and the vision of how they could be handled. Development: Categorized non-medication refills into 4 groups: results, forms, medical question/ symptom, other. Found existing electronic templates for outpatient calls and modified for our project needs. Determined a minimum amount of information needed for each encounter and then created algorithms to follow depending on the category and circumstance. Through this method it became clear that our triage procedure also needed to be standardized as calls to the doctor's office are first answered by medical secretaries. Thus, we worked closely with our nursing staff to create algorithms for the medical secretaries on when patients should speak with a triage nurse immediately vs. it could be handled by a clinical team member that same or next day. Implementation: Standardization process vetted at respective meetings for all team members. Training manual was created and distributed. Medical secretaries underwent individual training sessions over 1 month via a “go live” format following the new standardization procedure with actual patients. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): Evaluation: Mixed methods electronic survey given pre-/post-intervention to health care team members. Additionally, we conducted a pre-intervention and will conduct a post-intervention random chart audit of telephone encounters to determine the non-medication refill message category, number of days to resolve, number of people involved, and total calls. FINDINGSTODATE (IT ISNOTSUFFICIENTTOSTATE FINDINGSWILL BE DISCUSSED): Pre-Intervention: survey April 2014; 52 % response rate (46/89). Fifty percent were not satisfied with current non-medication refill messaging process. Sixtyfour, 43, and 29% responded that they always or often would have to call back or bounce back a non-refill message for medical symptoms/questions, test results, or forms, respectively because of missing information. Random chart audit of 24 telephone encounters; Categorized: results 34 %, medical questions/symptoms 25 %, forms 25 %, and other 16 %. To resolve it took an average of 3.2 days (range 1-10) and involved >2 people (range 1-5) and average of 2 calls (range 1-3). Post-Intervention: survey Sept 2014; 49 % response rate (39/80). Seventy-nine percent were satisfied with the new standardization for non-medication refill messaging. Twenty-eight percent, and 15 % responded that they often would have to call back or bounce back a non-refill telephone message for medical symptoms/questions, test results, or forms, respectively because of m ss ng information. Feedback: medical secretaries appreciate the ability to communicate to patients a timeframe of when to expect resolution of their message; nurses appreciate getting complete information and correct numbers to call patients; team members vested increasing use of the PHR to communicate test results and appropriate issues electronically; physicians appreciate more clarity/detail around what patient is asking for or wanting, that many messages can be handled by other team members. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Lessons Learned: Required a committed team and dedicated time for the necessary planning, implementation, and evaluation. Considerable undertaking to create standardization for each of the 4 non-medication refill categories, however, wanted to minimize confusion around when it should or should not be used and so chose to make it a standard for all practice teams. Medical secretaries, a pharmacist, and physicians were on our team and utilized consultants in nursing, information technology, and administration. Imperative to work with EHR personnel early to know what is possible with EHR platform. Crucial to pilot with EHR test patients and slowly roll out through an iterative process; make changes based on feedback as needed. Challenges measurement and what EHR data can be queried automatically vs. manual chart review. This is adaptable to other outpatient primary care sites, especially those that utilize an EHR.

%X Many health professionals within the UK experience difficulty in accessing further education due to increased workload, reduction in budgets and personal commitments. This paper discusses the redevelopment of a children's pain management (CPM) module to blended e-learning in response to changing workforce needs. The rationale for changing the pedagogy which underpinned the mode of delivery of the module was associated with a number of factors. Reduction in student numbers, difficulties with nurses being released from their practice setting and a desire from stakeholders to maintain pain management education. An on-line questionnaire was utilised to undertake a module evaluation which formed part of the University teaching and learning strategy. Evaluations were generally positive, however, some ethical and professional issues emerged surrounding a lack of study time and level of computer expertise amongst the students. Negotiation is being undertaken with stakeholders to ensure future students are provided with protected study time. Further development with electronic assignment submission will enable the module to be accessible to a wider national and international audience. Change of module delivery to blended e-learning has assisted the health professional to learn in a manner that is adaptable to their workplace and promotes life-long learning by development of independent learning skills. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Most people donate blood safely and uneventfully. However, some people may experience an adverse event. At the conception of Points of Care, 230/10,000 whole blood donors experienced a faint type reaction. NHSBT donors are 18% less likely to return within one year if they have an adverse event - 35% if they felt faint and >50% if they actually faint. Appropriate management and reduction of adverse events is therefore a key strategic target for blood donation for 2011 and beyond. Aims: To develop a simple and easy to use integrated care pathway that optimises all opportunities to reduce adverse events, ensures that dignity is maintained and thus encourages donors to return. To integrate and promote clinical therapeutic interventions into the entire operational process of blood donation. To highlight how all aspects of a blood donation environment can impact on the donor experience. Method: Using the key stages of Welcome, Screening, Donation and Refreshments, the donation process was closely examined to establish which therapeutic interventions could be made to prevent adverse events and improve overall experience. All interventions selected were evidence based, e.g. bolus water ingestion and applied muscle tension techniques. To enhance its success, Points of Care (POC) also gives guidance in the following areas: - Environment - how to control it to reduce its major contribution in triggering anxiety. - Staff behaviours - how promoting trust and professionalism reduces uncertainty and anxiety. - Donors history and preparation - how this should determine an individualised plan of care. - Recognising high risk and vulnerable donors - how this should be discreet and specific interventions identified. - Recognising individual coping strategies - how these can be used to positively impact a donor's experience. - Appropriate use of donation position - optimum for the avoidance of orthostatic hypotension. - To maximise the impact of POC, in addition to all donor facing staff, the Operational Management Team and all staff involved in the promotion of blood donation also received POC training. POC has now been produced as a pocket sized guide for use by all blood collection team staff. (The booklet will be displayed.) Results: The faint and faint type reaction rate for December 2010 was 168/ 10,000 a 27% reduction. POC has also been used as a basis to plan and manage an alternative type of session for university students, where first time donor adverse events were reduced by over 50%. POC became a catalyst in addressing knowledge gaps in physiology and practice amongst nurses, resulting in e-learning study modules being designed to target these gaps. Summary/Conclusion: The development of a clear and defined care pathway has provided a clear and simple framework to ensure donor safety and improved experience, whilst maintaining operational targets around productivity and collection to business plan. POC will now be used in root cause analysis of donor adverse events, to audit practice and identify further areas for improvement. Next steps will be to extend the pathway to further ensure excellence in adverse event management and prevention of delayed events.

%X Patients with pressure ulcers suffer pain and distress from wounds that can require treatment for many months following discharge from hospital (Havard, 2007). This initial and ongoing treatment accounts for around four per cent of the NHS annual budget (Bennett et al, 2004), therefore pressure ulcer prevention and management is beneficial not only to patients but also the NHS. Education for healthcare professionals is an important factor in the prevention and management of pressure ulcers; however, in the current climate releasing staff to attend study days is becoming difficult. In some locations staff have to travel long distances in order to attend while locally-based study days are poorly attended. Developing e-based learning was seen as a realistic option for nurses working in Trust within a large geographical area.

%X Aim. This paper is a report of a project to introduce and evaluate methods for using information and communication technologies to involve academic staff, students, and patients in a common synchronous e-learning environment. Background. Although there is no strong evidence for this, there may be benefits in 'efficiency' and for patients and students from shared e-learning. Asynchronous e-learning methods in nursing education are well-established, but synchronous methods have received less attention. However, if feasible, because they are more akin to face-to-face contact, they may be more suitable for patients and may provide a quicker development path for e-learning. Method. We evaluated three synchronous technologies: (1) non-commercial satellite interactive television (TV); (2) Internet videoconferencing; and (3) webcasting, through feasibility studies of 'TV-style' panel discussions on health topics and seminars with interaction with viewers by e-mail, inter-site research meetings with face-to-face interaction, user surveys and literature reviews. Results. Interactive satellite TV required the booking of rooms with specialized receiving equipment. This limited accessibility contributed to the high cost per participant. Videoconferencing proved acceptable for cross-site research meetings and is proposed for joint meetings for doctoral students with overseas centres but has the same access issues as interactive satellite TV. Webcasting is accessible to most users with Internet access and provides a feasible means of delivery of synchronous interactive material. Reported live webcasts have had audiences of thousands. Presentation formats: panel discussions with mixed patient-professional membership and mixed patient-professional audiences were acceptable to participants but engaging academic staff and students was problematic. This may be overcome with webcasting but there may still be barriers such as time-tabling and students' concerns about learning in the same 'live' environment as patients. Conclusions. Limitations in accessibility have been demonstrated for both satellite broadcasts and videoconferencing. Webcasting proved the most acceptable way of supporting a common synchronous environment. Having identified a feasible synchronous method we can now investigate hypothesized benefits for staff, students, and patients of combined e-health e-learning. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Learning activities and course design in the new context of e-learning, such as in web-based courses involves a change both for teachers and students. The paper discusses factors important for e-learning to be successful. The development of an online course in medical physics and technology for high school teachers of physics, details of the course, and experience gained in connection with it are described. The course syllabus includes basics of radiation physics, imaging techniques using ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, and external and internal radiation therapy. The course has a highly didactic approach. The final task is for participants to design a course of their own centered on some topic of medical physics on the basis of the knowledge they have acquired. The aim of the course is to help the teachers integrate medical physics into their own teaching. This is seen as enhancing the interest of high school students in later studying physics, medical physics or some other branch of science at the university level, and as increasing the knowledge that they and people generally have of science. It is suggested that the basic approach taken can also have applicability to the training of medical, nursing or engineering students, and be used for continuing professional development in various areas. © 2005 IPEM.

%X In November 1999, the Queensland Health (QH) Transition to Practice Nurse Education Program - Intensive Care (TPNEP-IC) was initiated in QH Intensive Care Units (ICUs) across Queensland. This 12-month, state-wide, workplace based education program has set minimum standards for intensive care nursing education and therefore minimum standards for intensive care nursing practice in QH. In the 12 years of operation, 824 nurses have completed TPNEP-IC, 761 achieving academic credit status and 453 utilising this academic credit status to undertake postgraduate study in critical/intensive care nursing at three Queensland universities. These outcomes were achieved through the appointment of nurse educators within ICUs who, through a united and strong commitment to this state-wide approach formed collaborative professional networks, which resulted in the development, implementation and maintenance of the program. Furthermore, these networks enabled a framework of support for discussion and dissemination of evidence based practice, to endorse quality processes for TPNEP-IC and to nurture leadership potential among educators. Challenges to overcome included obtaining adequate resources to support all aspects of the program, gaining local management and administrative support, and embedding TPNEP-IC within ICU culture. The 12 years of operation of the program have demonstrated its long term sustainability. The program is being launched through a new blended learning approach utilising e-learning strategies. To capitalise on the current success, a strong commitment by all stakeholders will be required to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the program. © 2011 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd.

%X We are a group of medical students, who met during the Summer School for Integrative Medicine 2011 at the University Witten-Herdecke. After this intense time at the Summer School as well as events such as the ECIM the question arose as to how can could stay as enthusiastic, motivated and committed to integrative medicine in daily life? In addition, it is increasingly difficult to keep up to date with opportunties in the field of integrative medicine in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Together we created the 'Portal for Integrative Medicine' - an Internet-based platform. Our goals are: networking by connecting people who are interested in broadening their horizons, enriching the landscape of academic medicine and expanding its borders (e.g., students, doctors, therapists and nurses); spreading information about continuing further education in Integrative Medicine; facilitating active exchange between individuals, initiatives, projects and training opportunities. The portal is aimed at two main target groups: individuals and initiatives. Offers for individuals include: an interactive calendar for integrative medicine events such as workshops, lectures, congresses; initiatives geographically listed; and collection of interesting new articles, research findings, videos, book reviews, podcasts, etc. Initiatives will be presented, connect to other initiatives, and find new members or participants. For this purpose they can use the event guide or present/locate their initiative on a map. The initiatives can receive new input for their own events through biographies of lecturers. Partners are the European Society for Integrative Medicine, Medizin mit Herz und Hand, Medizin und Menschlichkeit, Tellerrand-Netzwerk für Herzensmedizin, Jung mediziner forum and Einherz.

%X This study confirmed the educational effectiveness of practical exercises (PE) using intravenous (IV) simulators incorporating virtual reality (VR)/haptics (based on the sense of touch) device technologies. First-year nursing students (n= 114) were randomly divided into three PE groups: Group A, utilizing a conventional arm model (IV arm); Group B, utilizing a VR/Haptics IV Simulator (IV sim); and Group C, utilizing both the IV arm and IV sim. Group C scored highest on procedures for conducting venipuncture. Group B was more successful in performing injections than Groups A and C. Group C required significantly less time than Group B to complete a venipuncture injection and was faster than Group A, although this difference was not significant. In conclusion, a new paradigm of PE is suggested using both IV sim and IV arm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Educating health care professionals is a key issue in the provision of quality healthcare services. Interprofessional education has been suggested as a means of meeting this challenge. Four Finnish polytechnics providing education for nurses, social workers and physiotherapists wished to develop the content and methods of teaching the care of the elderly by collaboratively creating and implementing an interprofessional module of 15 European Credit Transfer units, using e-learning. This paper examines the planning and assessment of the impact of the pilot module. The web-based environment eminently suited teaching interprofessional care of the elderly. It supported content and methodological development and renewal of the module. It enabled discussion and collaboration between nursing, social work and rehabilitation teachers and students from the Polytechnics which are located in different parts of Finland. However, it became evident during the pilot that the most crucial challenges of the web-based pedagogy were in the ability of the teacher to supervise, support and motivate students and the organisation of interprofessional learning offered by collaborating institutions. © Taylor & Francis Ltd.

%X Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions (staff training, care-delivery models, changes to the environment) to reduce and manage agitation and aggression in nursing home and assisted living residents. Design Three bibliographic databases, references of systematic reviews, ClincalTrials.gov, and the International Controlled Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral outcomes for nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Five investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Inclusion was limited to studies with low to moderate risk of bias. Setting Nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Participants Facility caregiving staff. Measurements Agitation, aggression, antipsychotic and other psychotropic use, general behavior. Results Nineteen unique studies met entry criteria, addressing several categories of facility caregiver training interventions: dementia care mapping (DCM; n = 3), person-centered care (PCC; n = 3), clinical protocols to reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs (n = 3), and emotion-oriented care (n = 2). Eleven additional studies evaluated other unique interventions. Results were pooled for the effect of each type of intervention on agitation and aggression: DCM (standardized mean difference -0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.66 to 0.42), PCC (standardized mean difference -0.15, 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.38), and protocols to reduce antipsychotic and other psychotropic use (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory mean difference -4.5, 95% C = -38.84 to 29.93). Strength of evidence was generally insufficient to draw conclusions regarding efficacy or comparative effectiveness. Conclusion Evidence was insufficient regarding the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions to reduce agitation or aggression in nursing home and assisted living facility residents with dementia.

%X Background: Despite the existence of numerous guidelines for peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) insertion and care, outcomes for peripheral catheters are reportedly sub-optimal. Furthermore, little is known about PIVC outcomes in developing nations. Optimising infection control of PIVCs is a unique challenge for developing and least developed countries. Following devastating events in 2002, the Centre Médical Evangélique de Nyakunde in Democratic Republic of Congo is slowly rebuilding hospital capacity and tackling the challenges of infection control in difficult conditions. Aim: To conduct a global prevalence study to analyse current practices of PIVC management, identify areas for improvement in catheter care and infection prevention, and support hospital staff across the world to build research capacity in vascular access device care. Methods: Interest in the study was spread via professional networks, conferences, newsletters, industry partners, social media, and global research networks. Local investigators assumed the role of study champion, promoting the study in their own country. Participants included staff nurses and physicians, infection control and vascular access clinicians, nurse educators, and nursing and medical researchers. Multiple language options were provided. On a given day, decided by each organisation, consenting hospital patients permitted the details of their PIVC to be collected for the study. No identifying patient data was collected. Results: More than 750 hospitals in 65 countries participated in the study from June 2014 until April 2015. The Centre Médical Evangélique de Nyakunde will present their reasons for participation and unique challenges faced during the experience of participating in this global study. Key issues identified by this central African hospital included inadequate internet connection, lack of knowledge of best practice in PIVC insertion and management, and subsequent waste of valuable resources. Discussion: Enthusiasm for this global prevalence study has led to the development of cross-cultural nursing and medical research partnerships in over 65 countries. With networks and research pathways now established, opportunities abound for further collaborative research to improve care of vascular access devices and prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection. It is hoped that twinning opportunities for Centre Médical Evangélique de Nyakunde will arise as a result of participation in this research.

%X Introduction: Intrapericardial fibrinolysis has been proposed as a means of preventing complications of pericardial effusion such as cardiac tamponade, persistent and recurrent pericardial effusion, and pericardial constriction. There is a need to understand the efficacy and safety of this procedure because it shows promise. Methods and analysis: We aim to assess the effects of intrapericardial fibrinolysis in the treatment of pericardial effusion. We will search PubMed, the Cochrane Library, African Journals online, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Trip database, Clinical trials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for studies that evaluate the efficacy and/or safety of complete pericardial fluid drainage by intrapericardial fibrinolysis irrespective of study design, geographical location, language, age of participants, aetiology of pericarditis or types of fibrinolytics. Two authors will do the search independently, screen the search outputs for potentially eligible studies and assess whether the studies meet the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies between the two authors will be resolved through discussion and arbitration by a third author. Data from the selected studies shall be extracted using a standardised data collection form which will be piloted before use. The methodological quality of studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools for assessing risk of bias for experimental studies and non-randomised studies, respectively. The primary meta-analysis will use random effects models due to expected interstudy heterogeneity. Dichotomous data will be analysed using relative risk and continuous with data mean differences, both with 95% CIs. Ethics and dissemination: Approval by an ethics committee is not required for this study as it is a protocol for a systematic review of published studies. The results will be disseminated through a conference presentation and peer-reviewed publication. Review registration number: PROSPERO, CRD42014015238.

%X PURPOSE: The variable impact of TeleICU practice on ventilator management may reflect structural and process differences among TeleICU providers. In this study, we asked if the implementation of daily scheduled ventilator rounds via TeleICU platform enhanced process efficiency and outcome. METHODS: A retrospective, population-based, cross-sectional analysis was conducted comparing APACHE IV adjusted Ventilation Duration Ratio [VDR] and low Vt strategy adherence [for P/F<300] before and after implementation of TeleICU directed daily bedside ventilator rounds. The study was conducted by an independent TeleICU practice utilizing Philips VISICUâ¢ licensed eCare Managerâ¢ platform, providing ICU care and process improvement programs to community hospital ICUs with wide geographic distribution. Hospitals were included that subscribed to TeleICU services during both pre-and post-ventilator rounds implementation. Multidisciplinary ventilator rounds required participation of TeleICU physicians utilizing audiovisual link to bedside respiratory therapist and nurse. Ventilator settings, CXR review, and liberation readiness evaluation were facilitated by template checklist prepopulated by TeleICU nurse and nurse practitioner. One subscribing hospital included in cross-sectional analysis [Hospital 2] did not adopt structured ventilator rounds,though they received quarterly data and feedback on performance during the follow-up interval. RESULTS: Significant reduction was noted in mean VDR after implementation of TeleICU conducted ventilator rounds [1.04Â±0.27 v. 0.72Â±0.24, p<0.01, pre-implementation (Q4/2009; n=385) v. post implementation (Q3/2011; n=295)]. In patients with P/F<300, percentage Vt < 7.5ml/kg IBW improved from 42.6 to 47.5% [p<0.01; n=1416]. In the subset of patients with documented ARDS/ALI, Vt < 6.5 ml/kg IBW improved from 23.3 to 55% [p<0.001; n=129]. Exposure to formal daily ventilator rounds was associated with improved Vt adherence [Hospitals 1, 3, & 4; p<0.02], whereas the absence of this exposure was associated with no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The association of improved ventilator duration ratio and low Vt strategy after TeleICU participation in structured daily ventilator rounds raises the possibility that this process contributed to the observed improvements.

%X Objective To identify a novel method to educate learners in communication and end-of-life care. Background. The use of standardized patients to teach medical and nursing students has been well studied in the realms of communication and physical exam skills. In addition, it is accepted by the adult learner as interactive, experiential, and involves immediate feedback. With more curricular time devoted to end-oflife care, we have found that simulation of the dying patient is a useful way to teach and evaluate learner skills. We present our novel, multidisciplinary experience with an end-of-life patient simulation using role-playing. Methods. We will demonstrate a standardized patient encounter of a patient with end-stage multiple myeloma on hospice, who presents to the emergency department with distressed family for uncontrolled symptoms. During the encounter, the patient (mechanical simulator controlled electronically in real time) declines further and dies. Faculty observe and assess core skills performed. Immediately afterwards, students, faculty, and standardized patients discuss feedback of performance and learners complete a written assessment. Scenarios vary among medical and nursing students based on core skills desired. Results. Twenty-four medical students and 93 nursing students have completed the encounter. The experience was reported to be beneficial in 100% of the encounters. Discussion. This experience has been well received by the learners and provides the faculty with a clear picture of knowledge gaps in communication, family support, and symptom management. It also provides a new forum for inter-professional collaboration. We plan to expand the encounter beginning in July 2012 to include all 120 year 4 medical students and the entire nursing school class. In addition, we will begin collecting pre- and post-encounter data about attitudes and knowledge in end-of-life care. This experience has been well received by the learners and provides the faculty with a clear picture of knowledge gaps in communication, family support, and symptom management. It also provides a new forum for inter-professional collaboration. Conclusion. The use of the standardized patient to teach and evaluate end-of-life skills is useful and appreciated. We will share our experience and outcomes in teaching each desired core skill and provide a visual example of this reproducible teaching tool.

%X INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The prompt workup of hematuria can lead to early diagnosis of significant serious conditions of the GU tract. The benefits of early detection of hematuria include not only the early discovery of significant benign and malignant conditions, but also reduced mortality from bladder cancer in screened populations. However, there is often a delay in the evaluation of patients with hematuria. METHODS: An anonymous 9 question online survey was sent to primary care providers within the VA system. We evaluated hematuria practice patterns amongst primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. We attempted to determine the thresholds for “significant hematuria”, further diagnostic testing and specialist referral. RESULTS: There were 648 responses from physicians (64%), nurse practitioners (30%), and physician assistants (7%). Routine yearly urinalysis in all asymptomatic patients was performed by 343 (53%) providers. 12% never checked a routine yearly urinalysis and 34% checked only in patients with specific conditions such as diabetics and smokers. The most commonly accepted definition of hematuria was >5 RBC/HPF (61%); 18% (117) considered any RBC/HPF as hematuria, 9% (55) considered it a positive dipstick, and 4% (27) considered only gross hematuria to be significant. As the “initial step” for microscopic hematuria, most providers would either repeat the urinalysis or send the urine for culture (67% and 17%, respectively). The most commonly utilized “next steps” for microscopic hematuria were imaging studies (36%), urine culture (19%), urine cytology (17%), and referral to urology (14%). For gross hematuria the most common “initial steps” were imaging studies (45%), urine culture (20%), and urology referral (12%). The most frequent “next steps” for gross hematuria were referral to a urologist (59%) and imaging studies (23%). The initial imaging studies of choice were renal ultrasound (35%), CT scan with and without I.V. contrast (20%), and intravenous pyelogram (18%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range in the definition and evaluation of both microscopic and gross hematuria in the primary care setting. The lack of standardized definitions and protocols for screening and workup may in some cases delay the diagnosis of significant GU pathology resulting in adverse outcomes. The data provides a platform on which to develop educational materials for primary care providers.

%X Background: PC and oncology teams can most effectively improve patient experience during cancer when the specialties improve care processes together through collaborative QI activities. To support collaboration ASCO, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, and Duke University developed a partnership to pilot the ASCO VLC. This pilot will develop and test a scalable model for quality improvement and dissemination of best practices, focused on improving palliative care in oncology. Methods: The ASCO VLC integrates lessons learned through the Breakthrough Series, ASCO Quality Training Program, and others. An Advisory Committee representing expertise in medical oncology, palliative care, geriatrics, nursing, social work, survivorship, health services research, and quality improvement oversees the pilot project. Content in the VLC website was refined based on feedback gathered through a needs assessment survey of pilot participants. Results: The online collaborative and learning platform went live in June 2014. The site houses live and recorded educational sessions covering PC and QI topics, includes discussion boards to foster interactions between practices, supports sharing of tools and resources, and allows practices to submit their problems and aims statements, and results of their work for peer review and feedback. 24 practices were recruited to participate; 73% from community/private practice sites. In response to the needs assessment, 85% of participants responded with a high sense of comfort with PC; yet, only 33% had similar comfort with QI. When asked to rank their top preference, respondents were most interested in learning about pain and symptom management (44%), or advance care planning (22%). Ongoing mixed qualitative and quantitative assessments through Spring 2015 will assess feasibility and acceptability of the ASCO VLC model. Conclusions: We are creating an online virtual learning collaborative as a sustainable infrastructure to support and foster clinician education and dissemination of PC best practices in oncology.

%X High fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) has become an increasingly popular teaching methodology in nursing education. To date, there have not been any published studies investigating HFPS scenarios incorporating medical and psychiatric nursing content. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design to assess if HFPS improved student knowledge and retention of knowledge utilizing three parallel 30-item Elsevier HESI(TM) Custom Exams. A convenience sample of 37 senior level nursing students participated in the study. The results of the study revealed the mean HESI test scores decreased following the simulation intervention although an analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined the difference was not statistically significant (p = .297). Although this study did not reveal improved student knowledge following the HFPS experiences, the findings did provide preliminary evidence that HFPS may improve knowledge in students who are identified as "at-risk." Additionally, students responded favorably to the simulations and viewed them as a positive learning experience.

%X Introduction: Peripheral venous catheters are frequently inserted in hospitalized patients but harbor the risk of a nosocomial bloodstream infection. Evidence-based guidelines clearly described specific steps that are known to reduce the risk of infection. But their implementation in clinical practice is not known. Objectives: Aim of the study was to describe the status quo of specific steps in clinical practice at insertion of peripheral venous catheters and to implement a multimodal intervention with the aim to improve both compliance and the optimum order of steps. Methods: The study took place at the University Hospital Hamburg. At the beginning an optimum procedure for inserting a peripheral venous catheter was defined based on three evidence-based guidelines (WHO, CDC, RKI) including five steps with 1A or 1B level of evidence: hand disinfection before patient contact, skin antisepsis of puncture site, no palpation of treated puncture site, hand disinfection before aseptic procedure, and sterile dressing on puncture site. Healthcare workers in four different departments (endoscopy, central emergency admissions, pediatrics, and dermatology) were observed by a research nurse while inserting a peripheral venous catheter and the procedure recorded. A multimodal intervention with 5 elements was established (teaching session, dummy training, e-learning tool, tablet and poster, and direct feedback), followed by the second observation period. During the last observation week participants were asked to evaluate the intervention. Results: 207 insertions were observed in the control period, 202 in the intervention period. Compliance improved in four of five steps significantly (e.g. from 11.6 to 57.9 % for hand disinfection before patient contact; p<0.001, Chi square test). Compliance with skin antisepsis of the puncture site was very high before and after the intervention (99.5 and 99.0 %, respectively). The right order of specific steps also improved, e.g. from 7.7 to 68.6 % when three of the five steps were done (p<0.001). 46.8 % of the participants described the intervention as helpful, 46.8 % as neutral, and 6.4 % as disturbing. Conclusions: A multimodal strategy to improve both compliance with patient safety relevant steps and performance of an optimum procedure is effective and may help to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated bloodstream infections.

%X Introduction: The adoption of e-learning platforms can offer a number of benefits including greater learning flexibility in several arenas including healthcare. The present study aims to explore the perceptions of healthcare postgraduate students regarding the adaptability of e-learning and Web-based courses. Methods: The research was based on the four dimensions of the Technology Acceptance Model, i.e. Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Attitude towards use and Behavioural intention. A questionnaire covering these 4 dimensions was created, uploaded on a website and the 39 MSc students enrolled in the Healthcare Management and Health Informatics at the Faculty of Nursing, University of Athens, Greece, invited to complete it. Completed questionnaires were analysed using Partial Least Squares and other statistical techniques. Results: A total of 20 questionnaires were fully completed. Analysis of the results demonstrated that postgraduate students appreciate and perceive usefulness and ease of use as key factors towards using e-learning platforms and online courses. Conclusion: The study has a number of limitations including the small sample size. For that reason, we conducted a downsized modeling scenario in order to produce observations and compare results, in terms of validity. Nevertheless despite these limitations, the current study can be useful in helping to guide the development and implementation of e-learning initiatives. © The Journal on Information Technology in Healthcare 2009.

%X INTRODUCTION: Newly graduated nurses are expected to possess clinical skills and the ability to critically judge quality in patient care. There are an increasing number of baccalaureate nursing (BSN) schools that are integrating the use of patient simulation (PS) in the educational experience of their students. This descriptive study examines the use of PS technology in selected BSN programs in the United States. METHODS: This study targeted National League for Nursing-accredited BSN schools with an online survey related to the current use of PS in course curriculum and how it is being used. Two hundred nine BSN schools were identified and 78 schools responded (37.3% response rate). RESULTS: Sixty (78.9%) BSN schools responded to the survey reported using patient simulators in core clinical nursing courses: health assessment, nursing fundamentals, medical/surgical nursing I and II, pediatrics, and obstetrics courses. Approximately 31% of schools reported using high-fidelity scenarios in more than 51% of their clinical courses. The responding schools indicate that they are using PS in the usual undergraduate nursing courses that coincide with clinical settings. The replacement of actual clinical hours with PS remains controversial and unresolved. Responses to an open-ended question indicated interest in using PS but that many schools are limited by not having a dedicated faculty to champion the way and resources to purchase the technology. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were limitations to this study, it is one of the first to describe the patterns of using PS in nursing schools for clinical education. As the use of this technology grows in BSN programs, addressing the issues resulting from this study are essential to understanding the use of this technology in nursing education.

These include: emergent nature of the procedures, instructor time, availability of clinical material, and anatomic knowledge. Virtual Reality simulators address each of these obstacles. The National Capital Area Medical Simulation Center is a unique national asset that not only uses state-of-the-art simulators to teach trauma care skills to medical students and others, but adapts existing technology and develops new simulations to teach these skills. Most standard trauma training is performed on either mannequins or anesthetized animals and requires the constant presence of an instructor. VR applications can be stand-alone devices that have built-in scenarios and multiple patients to increase variation and/or level of technical expertise required to successfully complete the required steps of the trauma procedure. Commercial VR simulators to teach trauma skills include: CathSim Intravenous Simulator (HT Medical), UltraSim Ultrasound Simulator (MedSim), Limb Trauma Simulator (Musculographics/BDI), and the Human Patient Simulator (MedSim). Additionally, we have developed two additional simulators based on the HT CathSim; these are the pericardiocentesis simulator and the diagnostic peritoneal lavage simulator. Future applications include virtual environment triage simulation and surgical airway simulators.

%X The European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS) has provided professional support to cancer nurses since 1984 and represents the voice of more than 22,000 cancer nurses from 29 European countries. EONS' mission is to promote a healthier future for people affected by cancer, ensuring that they will benefit from the care of well educated, perceptive and proficient cancer nurses. EONS does this through education-, research-, and practice-based initiatives that utilize an evidence base. Such initiatives can only be achieved through effective two-way communication between its Members and a broad range of multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial organizations involved in cancer care. These collaborations enable its Members to optimize the nursing contribution of cancer patient care across Europe. EONS offers: Education projects to develop tailored materials: Skeletal Care Academy, Febrile Neutropenia, Nurses & Doctors in Pediatric oncology partnership.. Education courses to enhance skills: e-learning (radiotherapy, symptom clusters), target, TITAN, 5 day Masterclass, clinical leadership course, 4 curriculums (post-basic, breast, lung, elderly), accreditation... Accreditation Council to recognize quality educational programs Research projects to support evidence -based practice and understand patient & nurses' needs: PSA project, Breakthrough Cancer pain, Skin cancer project... Grants to encourage professional development such as Clinical travel, Novice research, Major research, Mentoring research, Congress travel, Translation.. Awards to recognize excellence: Excellence in Patient Education, TITAN Dissemination, Distinguished Merit and Lifetime Achievement. EONS also publishes in its associated journal: the European Journal of Oncology Nursing (EJON). This is a peerreviewed journal that publishes scientific articles and serves as a vehicle for the analysis and dissemination of recent developments in the cancer nursing field. The Society also provides its' Members with the EONS Newsletter that is a source of information on clinical topics, project news, updates on educational programs, as well as highlighting topical issues from recent conferences. EONS recently begun to develop online learning materials enabling those nurses who are unable to attend events and contribute to participate in learning activities. To support nurses in dealing with the side effects of radiotherapy, EONS launched a new online course on this topic in September 2010. This pilot course really hit the target and the large number of applications showed the need for this kind of educational opportunity. EONS organises a specialist cancer nursing congress (Spring Convention) once every two years. This congress focuses on practical skills building and education in the latest techniques. In the non-Spring congress year, a Nursing Program develops during the European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress. At the EONS 7th Spring Convention total of 134 abstracts were presented and over than six hundred nurses attended from 35 countries. The program highlighted such diverse topics as impact of EU policy, new developments in targeted therapy, radiotherapy and cancer genetics; updates on breast, lung, prostate and GI cancers; rehabilitation, survivorship, sexuality, emotional distress, ethical issues in cancer care; advance clinical practice, leadership and multi-professional working. Membership in EONS offers nurses outstanding opportunities to update and expand cancer care knowledge and to exchange information with colleagues across Europe.

%X Introduction: m-health, or mobile phone-based technology in healthcare, is touted as a cost-effective solution to expand access and improve outcomes in low-resource settings. Despite the proliferation of software applications (“apps”), best practices in app development, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, remain uncertain. Objectives: To define best practices in the design, development, and field-testing of healthcare apps in a resource-scarce setting, in order to optimize usability and uptake. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study involving detailed interviews with stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, including patients, nurses, physicians, administrators information technology staff, engineers, and software developers in hospitaland community-based settings in Mysore and Bangalore, India (n = 130). We used prototypes (mock-ups or partially functional software) to elicit user preferences and to define development priorities. Inputs obtained from stakeholders were quickly incorporated into the next iteration of prototypes, and the process was repeated (“rapid prototyping”). Results: Stakeholders had a favorable view of mobile technology-based solutions for healthcare, but less than half had used a healthcare app prior to the interview. Despite higher marginal costs, patients strongly preferred voice-based solutions to text-based solutions because of limited literacy and numeracy, and unavailability of Indian-language phones. Providers preferred versatile apps that were accessible from a variety of devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, and phones); responsive web-based solutions that were platform-agnostic therefore outperformed native mobile solutions (e.g., Android or iOS clients) except in settings with limited internet connectivity. Drop-down fields produced significantly fewer errors and were faster than free-text entry. In projects involving low-literacy users or international collaborators, clarification of the syntax for error-prone fields significantly reduced user error and improved efficiency, e.g., dates (MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY), phone numbers (e.g., with or without preceding area code), and numerical inputs involving decimals (e.g., lab results). Data encryption and role-based password authentication were acceptable solutions for data security. Conclusion: Agile development practices involving rapid, iterative prototyping, and early frequent engagement of patients and providers can yield valuable insights in the design and uptake of scalable m-health solutions.

%X Context: Absence of standardised pain curricula has led to wide diversity in the understanding and awareness of pain by healthcare students. Indeed pain management is frequently under-prioritised in nursing education, providing potential to negatively impact upon patient care. Yet the recent addition of Pain to the UK National Health Service's Essence of Care Benchmarks has highlighted the need to address this issue, and in response pain educators have called for the development of high quality, globally accessible e-learning resources in pain management. Objectives: This study will determine the effectiveness of an e-learning intervention on pain management developed for nursing students. Methods: Two variants of an e-learning resource on pain management were developed, each containing the same core content but one with a section focusing on pain assessment and the other on pharmacological management. Nursing students (n = 42) were randomly assigned to trial one resource, after which they undertook a questionnaire adapted (to ensure alignment with the content of the e-learning resources) from Ferrell and McCaffrey's Nurses Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Pain Survey. Scores were analysed for each resource and year of study, and compared with scores from a standard non-intervention group completing the questionnaire only (n = 164). Results: Scores averaged 19.2% higher for students undertaking the e-learning resources (p < 0.005). Specifically, undertaking the assessment resource improved assessment knowledge more, whilst assignment to the treatment resource particularly enhanced pharmacological knowledge (p < 0.005). Correlation was found between year of study and pain knowledge. Conclusion: Results support the effectiveness of the resources independent of voluntary-response bias. Conclusions recommend that introducing e-learning has substantial benefit to enhance pain education in nursing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The negative impact of malnutrition on patient outcomes and health care costs is well established. In 2012 a point prevalence study completed within the adult oncology population across 15 Victorian Health Services in 2012 determined 57% of inpatients, 32% of patients receiving chemotherapy, and 39% of patients receiving chemo-radiation were malnourished. One of the key recommendations from this study was that 'Health services should have resources available to multidisciplinary clinicians and cancer patients to improve awareness, recognition and understanding of malnutrition'. In order to provide education to a large number of clinicians, across different disciplines and geographical locations, an e-learning package was determined to be the optimal strategy. The project aims to increase knowledge/learning for all cancer care clinicians, provide accurate and evidence-based information on cancer malnutrition, efficient use of resources/reduction of duplication in a resource that can be used by all health services, consistency of information/education provided in cancer-malnutrition care, promote recognition of the importance of early intervention and patient management. Four unique and discipline specific packages (with six learning modules in each) have been developed for doctors, nurses, allied health, community general practitioners and practice nurses. The interactive learning modules provide an opportunity for active learning regarding malnutrition in oncology, nutritional implications of cancer and cancer therapies, malnutrition risk screening, nutrition intervention and multidisciplinary team involvement. A range of case studies are also presented to consolidate understanding. Multiple experts in the field have been consulted and contributed to development, content and review of the resource. The e-learning packages will promote awareness amongst cancer care clinicians of the significant issue of cancer malnutrition, resulting in improved prevention, early identification, as well as appropriate and timely management of this high risk group. This in turn will improve patient care and reduce the burden of malnutrition for individuals and health services.

%X Recent research has found that family caregivers do not discuss their caregiving in terms of tasks but instead describe their care as shaped by concerns, commitments and goals. The purpose of this paper is to challenge the ways in which nurses approach the family caregiving process and to explore possibilities for evolving nursing knowledge by questioning existing practice in the light of developing insight into the ways in which being a family caregiver is meaningful. A critique of the philosophical orientations of rationalism and empiricism provides a platform to discuss the merits of a Heideggerian phenomenological approach in assisting nurses to better understand family caring experience. Such critique serves to support the notion of displacing the traditional scientific view as the prime means of disclosing truth, acknowledging alternative ways of knowing.

%X Background Despite common usage of oxygen as a therapeutic intervention, audit suggests poor prescribing and administration practices exist. Contemporary studies and guidelines propose an influencing culture whereby oxygen is given to alleviate breathlessness with disregard for potential harm; but there is no evidence supporting this claim. Further suggestions indicate confusion regarding the use of oxygen therapy, possibly as a consequence of conflicting information; again, there is no evidence. The problem may self-perpetuate as erroneous beliefs are passed to patients, their carers and the general public. Aim To explore healthcare professionals' (HCPs) and patients' perceptions of oxygen therapy and help direct future research, education and practice. Method Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 28 patients and 33 HCPs, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and pharmacists. Self-reported beliefs and behaviours were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed iteratively using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Independent audit served to validate findings. Results Two overarching themes were identified: oxygen as a panacea and antecedents to beliefs (Figure 1). Sub-themes under these constants differed between HCPs and patients but fundamentally both groups viewed oxygen as an innocuous therapy with numerous benefits. HCPs use of oxygen stems from entrenched culture, expectations (of patients, families and other HCPs) and a need to 'to do something'. Patients are influenced by HCPs, past experiences (of self and others) and social media. Knowledge, education and understanding predisposed both groups' perceptions, but without exception all HCPs believed that they had not received enough education about oxygen therapy and an approach of DIY education prevails. (Table Presented) Conclusion These findings suggest that a set of fixed beliefs and practices regarding oxygen therapy exist, influenced by several factors. The overwhelming perception being that oxygen is a universal remedy. Patients rely on HCPs for education and information, yet HCPs' fixed beliefs regarding oxygen therapy can lead to ill-informed practice. As the gatekeepers to oxygen therapy, and a major influence on patients' education, HCPs would seem the logical catalyst to change these fundamental beliefs and practices. In order to achieve this, current educational curricula needs to be addressed.

%X Patient narratives have much to teach healthcare professionals about the experience of living with a chronic condition. While the biomedical narrative of HIV treatment is hugely encouraging, the narrative of living with HIV continues to be overshadowed by a persuasive perception of stigma. This paper presents how we sought to translate the evidence from a qualitative study of the perspectives of HIV affected pregnant women and expectant fathers on the care they received, from the pre conception to post natal period, into educational material for maternity care practice. Narrative scripts were written based on the original research interviews, with care taken to reflect the key themes from the research. We explore the way in which the qualitative findings bring to life patient and partner experiences and what it means for nurses, midwives and doctors to be prepared to care for couples affected by HIV. In so doing, we challenge the inequity between the dominance of biomedical knowledge over understanding the patient experience in the preparation of health professionals to care for HIV affected women and men who are having a baby or seeking to have a baby.

%X BACKGROUND: Recognising and responding to patients who are deteriorating are key aspects to improving outcomes. Simulations provide students with exposure to deteriorating patient scenarios and the role of nurses in such events. The number of programmes seeking to provide best possible simulation experiences is growing exponentially. Robust evaluation of these experiences is crucial to ensure maximum benefit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a deteriorating patient simulation experience on students' technical and communication skills; and to determine if differing study programmes and years of previous nursing experience influenced students' responses and experiences. METHODS: A convenience sample of final year nursing students (N=57) in a medical-surgical course at a large urban university completed a descriptive pre/post simulation survey rating their technical skills and communication abilities in recognising and responding to patient deterioration. Changes in pre/post scores were analysed including influence of study programme (3-year, 2-year Enrolled Nurse, 2-year Graduate Entry); gender; and years nursing experience (beyond course clinical practicum). RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in post-simulation survey scores were demonstrated for combined student group data. Students with greater years of nursing experience had statistically higher scores than those with less experience in both pre- and post-surveys. Specific improvements were identified for: assessing a deteriorating patient; and in seeking help from the medical officer or external service. CONCLUSIONS: All student groups gained benefit in participating in a deteriorating patient simulation. For this group, greater years of prior nursing experience led to higher pre- and post-survey scores. The learning activity provided students an experience of the importance of recognising and responding to an acute situation in a timely manner which may be recalled in subsequent clinical situations.

%X Despite technologic advances in task trainers and manikins, there persists an inability to replicate key clinical skills as would occur in clinical settings. This report provides details of a project to develop a functional and reliable tympanic thermal simulator prototype that could be embedded into the ear of a manikin to enable tympanic thermometers to be used during simulation encounters. A simple electrical circuit was built using (i) a standard 9-V battery, (ii) a switch, (iii) 5 × 62-Ω resistors in parallel for circuit stability, (iv) a 62-Ω resistor in parallel with (v) a 1-kΩ potentiometer to vary the infrared light-emitting diode (IRLED) intensity, and (vi) 2 IRLEDs. After confirming reliability of circuit performance, the IRLEDs were implanted into the ear of a manikin. Over 3 consecutive days, 3033 samples were recorded simulating a range of human body temperatures, controlled by altering current flow. Initial testing of the thermal simulator prototype indicates that a range of human temperatures (34.0°C-41.9°C) can be generated using high-intensity IRLEDs. Although, at higher applied current levels, the variation in measured temperature was larger (2.4°C) than at lower applied currents (0.2°C), reasonably precise temperatures were achieved. Testing and reporting initial prototype results are an important first step in developing and refining a useful product to enhance manikin capabilities associated with patient physical assessment in the simulation setting. Despite the undesired variation, the current design could still be used for teaching purposes in educational settings. Retrieving tympanic temperatures during "patient assessment" of the simulator benefits nursing, midwifery, and other health care students by enabling authentic practice. Further development of this prototype is required to improve the reliability, precision, and accuracy of the device.

%X • A service-academic partnership program formed from evidence-based literature suggests re-admission rates can be lowered through better preparation of clients during discharge by focusing on areas of client education as developed by Coleman and associates (2002). • Along with improved client care, the program was intended to address changes in the 2012 Medicare policy that will cease payment for avoidable 30-day re-admissions in the three target diagnoses. • To address this change in policy, the service-academic partnership program sought to share fiscal and administrative responsibilities between the authors' university nursing department and the largest community hospital in the area. • The tangible impacts and outcomes of the program, including improved patient safety and increased patient satisfaction, in conjunction with a decreased cost of care and reduction in avoidable re-admissions, have solidified the program's standing as a permanent component of the service platform. • The program's utilization of best practices and the simultaneous development of new practices to address emerging patient and community needs have created a sustainable framework for the program.

%X E-learning is regularly promoted in higher education settings as a way of fostering more flexible approaches to learning. It has been argued however that the 'potential benefits of new information and communication technology instruments in education' have not been subjected to critical scrutiny (Debande, O., 2004. ICTs and the development of e-learning in Europe: the role of the public and private sectors. European Journal of Education 39 (2), 191-208, p. 192). This paper outlines a multi-method evaluation of an e-learning innovation designed to teach clinical skills to student nurses. Responding to the challenges of teaching clinical skills to large class sizes, we developed a set of instructional videos for one undergraduate skills-based module, which are now integral to the module and available online to students on a continuous basis. Evaluation suggests that students' performance outcomes are unchanged. The students view the flexible and self-management aspects of this method of learning positively, with some attitudinal differences between male and female, and mature and non-mature students. However, it is best used to complement rather than replace lecturer demonstration, lending support to a 'blended' model (Collis, B., van der Wende, M., 2002.

%X Objectives To review clinical indications and demographics of transfusion and the patterns of blood component ordering, transfusion, wastage and traceability, before (2007) and after (2011) implementation of simple improvement strategies. Methods Retrospective case note review of all patients presenting to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) Emergency Department (ED) for whom a blood component was requested and historic comparison. Improvement measures implemented between 2007 and 2011 included (1) formal staff education, (2) use of elearning Module One Safe Transfusion Practice (traceability update, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) traceability regulations and importance of returning completed blood component tags), (3) an ED resuscitation room blood fridge, (4) introduction of a dedicated ED transfusion consultant and ED transfusion link nurse and (5) the presence of an ED consultant on the Hospital Transfusion Group. Results Between 1st January and 31st December 2011, blood components were requested for 255 patient episodes, totalling 1034 individual units. 687 units (66.4%) of blood component were transfused, 248 components (24.0%) were recycled, 90 components (8.7%) were discarded and nine units (0.9%) were unaccounted for. There was a 64% reduction in blood component ordering (3209 vs 1034 units), a 39% reduction in blood component transfusion (1131 vs 687 units) and a 96% reduction in unaccounted units (214 vs 9 units) between 2007 and 2011. There was a rise in the median age of the patient for whom a transfusion request was made from 63.9 years in 2007 to 67.0 years in 2011. Conclusions Blood component ordering, usage and traceability within the ED have improved significantly since 2007 following implementation of simple strategies. The age of ED transfusion recipients is increasing.

%X Introduction: The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and the Rating Form for IBD patient's Concerns, are widely used measures in IBD but fail to capture the essence of living with IBD from the patient's perspective. To deliver patient centred care it is imperative that we have an understanding of the experience of living with IBD. This study aimed to synthesise the findings of qualitative papers that explored the health and social needs of patients living with IBD. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, PsychInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index via the OVID platform to August 2010. Search filters developed by the Hedges database, McMaster University Health Information Research Unit and Kathryn Nesbit, Edward G Milner Library, University of Rochester, were adapted to aid the search. 1395 papers were generated by the preliminary search. Qualitative studies which explored the phenomena of living with IBD, English language and sample population adults >16 years were included. Study eligibility judgements and data extraction were independently completed by the authors. The papers were quality appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Synthesis was achieved by comparing the themes and findings of each study with one another to identify 1st order constructs. Repeated comparison between the papers revealed the similarities and differences, which led to 2nd order constructs and the new interpretation of the synthesised studies. Results: Six papers and one unpublished thesis were included, all from Western countries, one study included patients from an immigrant background. Combined sample of the studies was only 86 patients to describe the phenomena of living with IBD. First iteration of synthesis identified 16 themes, 2nd iteration synthesised these into three main constructs: “detained by the disease”; “living in a world of disease”; “wrestling with life”. “Detained by the disease” is the fear of incontinence, and the behaviour the patients displays as a result of this. Social isolation and missing out on life events all serve to “pull” the patient back from normal living. “Living in a world of disease” is living with the fear of a long term condition.“ Wrestling with life” is the “push” to continue normal living. Conclusion: People with IBD endure many daily challenges, stress, pain, fighting for control. The combined impact of living with IBD is the tension they live with. The value of metasynthesis is the interpretation of all of the synthesised studies to provide a global representation of living with IBD: “Pushed and pulled: a compromised life”, people living with IBD experience a constant conflict throughout their lives, they push to be normal but IBD pulls them back.

%X AIM: To undertake a metasynthesis of qualitative studies to understand the health and social needs of people living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A systematic search strategy identified qualitative studies exploring the phenomenon of living with inflammatory bowel disease. Databases included MEDLINE, PsychInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL and the British Nursing Index via the OVID platform. Qualitative search filters were adapted from Hedges database (http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/hslt/miner/ digital_library/tip_sheets/Cinahl_eb_filters.pdf). Qualitative empirical studies exploring the health and social needs of people living with inflammatory bowel disease were selected. Study eligibility and data extraction were independently completed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies. The studies were analysed and synthesised using metasynthesis methodology. The themes from the studies allowed for common translations into a new interpretation of the impact of living with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Of 1395 studies, six published studies and one unpublished thesis fulfilled the inclusion criteria. First iteration of synthesis identified 16 themes, 2nd iteration synthesised these into three main 2nd order constructs: "detained by the disease"; "living in a world of disease" and "wrestling with life". "Detained by the disease" is the fear of incontinence, the behaviour the patients display due to the fear, and the impact this has on the individual, such as social isolation and missing out on life events. All of these serve to "pull" the patient back from normal living. "Living in a world of disease" is the long term effects of living with a long term condition and the fear of these effects. "Wrestling with life" is the continued fight to thrive, the "push" to continue normal living. CONCLUSION: The metasynthesis provides a comprehensive representation of living with IBD. The unmistakeable burden of incontinence is exposed and its ongoing effects are demonstrated. The combined overall impact of living with IBD is the tension these patients live with: "Pushed and pulled: a compromised life", people living with IBD experience a constant conflict throughout their lives, they push to be normal but IBD pulls them back. The impact of the fear of incontinence and behaviour of the individual as a result, requires further qualitative enquiry. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

%X Purpose Medical imaging is essential for the diagnosis and therapy of patients across a broad spectrum of medical disciplines. Imaging data is required at different points of the surgical treatment process in different modes of presentation. Traditional ways of viewing medical imaging data (i.e., Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) workstations) in a stacked fashion removed from the patient may change with virtual and augmented reality (AR). We firstly present a new, interactive and immersive method of visualizing preoperative planning data with a 3D virtual reality framework using the head-mounted display (HMD) Oculus Rift™ (Oculus VR LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and show feasibility, assess satisfaction and acceptance of the technology and evaluate its potential by medical professionals, Fig. 1. Secondly we present a mobile, real-time and point-of-care augmented reality system for medical diagnosis and therapy and evaluated it with regard to feasibility and accuracy in a pilot study involving phantom, animal, and human models, Fig. 2. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of virtual and augmented reality in the surgical treatment process. Methods For virtual reality we selected a sample case of a colorectal cancer patient with multiple hepatic metastases planned for liver resection. We segmented the liver and gallbladder surface, the arterial, venous and portal venous vasculature, the bile ducts and the liver tumors with a defined security margin from a CT-scan using the arterial and venous phases. We used the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg) for organ and vessel segmentation. Post-processing was carried out with MeshMixer (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA). We used the virtual reality HMD to visualize the intraoperative anatomical situation in the abdomen. By using the HMD the surgeon could access the three-dimensionally visualized upper abdomen, clinical patient data and the original CT images. We evaluated user satisfaction, acceptance and potential by an online questionnaire. For augmented reality computed tomography imaging was realized and a tablet computer was positioned above the patient and a semi-transparent 3D-representation of structures of interest were superimposed on top of the patient's image resulting in augmented reality. Live camera images and the three-dimensional volume were registered by fiducial markers. Feasibility and accuracy were evaluated in a static model using the open source Heidelberg Laparoscopy Phantom (openHELP). The system was further analyzed in a porcine animal study. The reprojection error for both phantom and animal studies was defined as the average offset of the back-projected two-dimensional image points and the manually defined points in the three-dimensional volume. Finally the setup was tested with a human volunteer to prove basic feasibility for clinical application. Results We evaluated the virtual reality system with attending surgeons (n = 13), resident surgeons (n = 34), medical students (n = 57), surgical nurses (n = 52) and non-medical staff (n = 22). In total 180 evaluations were performed. 89 % of the users were satisfied with the virtual reality scene, 90 % saw its potential to better evaluate complex surgical cases, 87 % found it useful in the training of medical students, 85 % in surgical training and 56 % in the training of nurses. 80 % saw high clinical potential of this technology. The AR-System was successfully realized in the phantom, animal and human model. In the phantom model of the 1380 analyzed AR-positions 83.9 % could be successfully realized. The reprojection error was 2.83 ± 2.68 mm. 95 % of the measurements were below 6.71 mm. In the animal model 79.3 % of the 690 analyzed AR-positions could be successfully realized. In the animal study the reprojection error was 3.52 ± 3.00 mm. 95 % of the measurements were below 9.49 mm. The reprojection error was significantly lower in the phantom model compared to the porcine model (P<0.001). At last augmented reality was successfully eal zed in clinical case. Conclusion Novel methods of image visualization and interaction are feasible, accurate and clinically practicable. Three-dimensional surgery planning and simulation in combination with immersive virtual reality can prove beneficial for complex liver resections, possibly improving patient care. It may also help younger surgeons to better understand the underlying anatomy of a surgical case and the reasoning behind the surgical decision-making processes. Secondly, mobile, real-time and point-of-care augmented reality systems for clinical purposes are feasible and accurate in a realistic experimental setting. (Figure presented).

%X In June 2014, The Royal Women's Hospital Gynaeoncology team and The Royal Melbourne Hospital Familial Cancer Centre (RMH-FCC) began work toward “mainstreaming” BRCA1/2 germline testing within the gyneoncology outpatients setting. This involved a Genetic Counselor from the RMH-FCC providing genetic counseling for patients with recently diagnosed high-grade, nonmucinous ovarian cancer who were attending outpatients or the chemotherapy day center as part of their acute care. This model has enabled infrastructure and necessary protocols to be put in place within the oncology setting for treatment-focused genetic BRCA1/2 germline testing to occur, involving genetic counseling expertise. In addition, the referral rate of patients with newly diagnosed high-grade serous ovarian cancer at The Royal Women's Hospital has increased significantly demonstrating that BRCA1/2 germline testing is increasingly being considered as standard of care by this gyneoncology team, with direct access to a genetic counselor. This presentation will outline the experience of this model, in particular, the Genetic Counselor's role, and how this has developed into a streamlined genetic testing process embedded within a gyneoncology service. The presentation will also outline how the findings from this model have served as a platform to inform future mainstreaming practice, whereby an oncology specialist or nurse could arrange BRCA1/2 germline testing while closely supported by an FCC.

%X RATIONALE:Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and the third leading cause of hospitalization. The single strongest predictor of future hospitalization or emergency visits for asthma is an admission in the previous 12 months. While discharge education is usually provided in written and oral formats, several studies indicate that patient education is not effective. As 40% of Americans have low health literacy levels, discharge instructions need to be provided in a more understandable and durable manner to achieve effective self-management and prevent costly readmission. METHODS:Following two focus groups of previously hospitalized asthmatic patients and caregivers (n=17 pairs total) to develop our tool, hospitalized asthmatic patients ages 4-12 years (mean=9y (SD=2.64) and their caregivers were engaged in their own discharge plan development. They were videotaped receiving education about their Asthma Action Plan (AAP), trigger avoidance, and correct metered-dose inhaler use as well as the importance of medical follow up. Participants were also screened for health literacy level with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Completed videos were interspersed with visual graphic and audio content on the asthma disease process, best management practices, as well as an avatar selected by the patient. Caregivers were then contacted up to 3 times, 12 days to 7.5 months (mean=58d (SD=57.54)) after receiving two DVDs (one to keep; one to share) along with laminated/paper AAPs to ascertain the instructions' usefulness, sharing of the video and their child's level of asthma control (via Asthma Control Test, ACT). RESULTS:Twenty patients and caregivers participated in the pilot study. Of these, 50% of caregivers had poor health literacy (<9th grade) and 55% had annual incomes <$20K/year. 85% completed follow-up calls; all indicated that they have watched their videos ≥1 times. 62.5% indicated that the video instructions alone were most useful, while 31.25% preferred the video along with their paper AAP. 82.5% had shared their video with family (siblings, grandparents, aunts) and 43.0% had shared it with school (nurse, teacher, coach). Currently, 87.5% indicated that they had adequate asthma control compared to 50% of our similarly selected focus group participants (p=0.024; ACT≥ 20). CONCLUSION: A personalized video approach has the potential to positively impact asthma self-management and improve asthma control compared to standard written discharge instructions - especially for persons with low levels of health literacy. A randomized control trial is needed to compare the effectiveness of the video discharge process to the customary education.

%X This paper presents the findings of a qualitative project conducted to investigate the education and training requirements that non-mental health trained emergency nurses need to enable them to effectively care for psychiatric patients presenting to a West Australian emergency department. Non-mental health trained nurses are ill-equipped in their psychiatric knowledge, assessment and communication skills to provide best possible care to the one in ten patients presenting to the emergency department with a complex mental health issue. The area of assessment and management of mental health patients in the emergency department is a complex one and staff are required to assess, triage and manage these patients appropriately. Furthermore, with aggression and violence increasing, emergency department nurses are concerned about their safety in the workplace. Focus groups with emergency nurses and semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts were conducted at one West Australian teaching hospital. The findings of the project demonstrated that these nurses considered that customer focus, workplace aggression and violence, psychiatric theory, mental health assessment and chemical dependence as key learning areas. These findings will form a platform for further education and training for ED staff. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It includes the Emergency Services College that provides all of the training for emergency service workers in Finland and provides some services for the international community. There are needs for training by the medical community in Finland that relate both to skills and knowledge. Education and training focus on the demonstration of evidence-based competence. The facility includes a training ground for the provision of immediate emergency medical care, scene safety, extrication, industrial accidents, and water rescue. It is used for the training of paramedic students, nurses, medical students, firefighters, dispatch center staff, and officers. Computer-aided simulations are used to enhance the learning process. Plans are underway for adding tele-education and/or virtual-reality facilities. Close liaison is maintained with the University of Kuopio, Kuopio University Hospital, and with the Pohjois-Savo Polytechnic Institute.

%X Background: Pleural effusions usually signify advanced disease, increased symptom load and limited life expectancy when malignant. They need prompt effective management, safely and with least possible inconvenience and discomfort. Patient choice is key and informed consent is crucial because of possible risks related to the invasive pleural intervention. Aim: To develop an interactive tool for healthcare professionals to illustrate and explain the various pleural modalities to patients and trainees. Method & Results: We initially used a focus group to determine the key areas, and then piloted it firstly amongst respiratory nurses, then amongst medical and nonmedical persons and lastly amongst patients; all the while incorporating feedback into the final version. This was then reviewed and approved by the Trust's “Patient Information Group” panel. Conclusion: This is an easy to use programme that helps inform patients of the available management options, what they entail and the procedural steps, providing a platform for an open and informed discussion of the pros and cons of each procedure and the possible risks. It has also been proven to be a useful training tool as well. We hope to demonstrate the programme on tablets or screens at the ERS and disseminate and share amongst colleagues. (Figure Presented).

%X Introduction and Aims: Improving the end of life care in kidney patients is a priority for the NHS Kidney care. Patients who are within their last 12 months of their life require a high-quality treatment and care, based on increased emphasis on comfort and support rather than cure. The NICE guidelines have identified a number of challenges in order to ensure that such patients receive the appropriate care, and to ensure they can make their wishes known, including the place of death so they can live to the full and to die with dignity. In 2010 to 2011, our regional Kidney Care Network and Cancer Network have put together an implementation group to develop a Pathway for End of Life Care in Kidney Disease. As part of the project, we designed a comprehensive staff questionnaire to find out whether the current level of training, knowledge and staff experience on end of life care met the quality markers for health care providers as suggested by the NICE and Gold Service framework. Methods: A total of 130 questionnaires were distributed to health care workers including consultants (8), renal speciality registrars (6), junior medical staff (6) and band 4 to 7 nurses (110) in three renal units in the northwest of England. The questions cover staff level of confidence, knowledge, training, perceived barrier, and experience regarding the end of life care and tools. Results: 105 questionnaires were returned. 85 were completed in full, but there were a few missing information in the rest of the questionnaires. Seventy two(72%) percent of the respondents were nurses. The majority of the staff (>80%) were aware of the holistic approach of end of life care, including symptoms control, social and psychological support, as well as spiritual input. According to 90 % of the staff, severe COPD, untreated malignancy and intolerance of dialysis were important prognostic indicators of poor outcome as compared to advancing age.A significant number of staff (70%) felt confident in identifying patients in their last 12 months of life by using the 'surprise question'. Lack of knowledge (82 %), training (65%), communication skill (65%), inappropriate environment (67%), and time (47%) were seen as main barriers for initiating end of life care discussions. Only 55% of staff was aware of the existence of Preferred Priorities for Care (PPC) document and Advance Care Planning. Most of the nursing staff (65%) felt confident in providing psychosocial, spiritual and religious support but there was a lack of confidence (51%) in breaking bad news and initiating discussions regarding withdrawal of dialysis. Staff attitude was largely positive (60%) towards palliative care. However, 90% of the staff admitted to being involved in end of life care discussions in less than 5 patients in the previous one year with little or no experience (77%) in completing the PPC document. Conclusions: It is increasingly recognised that there is a need to improve end of life care in advanced kidney patients. However, our survey has revealed significant gaps in the level of staff training and knowledge around different domains of end of life care. To fill this gap, we have developed a series of local workshops, and a resource pack freely available to all renal unit staff. Staff have also encouraged to undertaking e-learning to improve their knowledge. The next step is to set up a register of concern to ensure these patients will receive the necessary supportive therapy and care planning before the end of life.

%X Background: A highly skilled health work force is critical for improved HIV care and health outcomes. In Kenya, nurses form the backbone of health service and there is constant need to provide continuous training to them. However, such training usually takes them out of their working stations. University of Nairobi (UoN) in partnership with African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) and Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) embarked on a program for upgrading diploma nurses by offering a Bachelor of Nursing (BSN) degree using a blended distance learning approach. We describe the process of developing and implementing this course. Methods: The UoN, AMREF and NCK developed a curriculum for a 2.5-years blended e-learning which includes a two week face to face course each trimester. Course development involved: (1) establishing learning needs and determination of course objectives (2) designing of module/assignment instructions (3) development of the e-learning platform. Student assessment is done together with the full time pre-service BSN students. Findings: The first intake of 98 was done in 2012 and 65 (66%) will be graduating in December 2015. A total of 449 nurses have been enrolled into the course and there is a high demand with applications exceeding current capacity. The performance by the e-based students is comparable to their full-time counterparts. Interprtation: Blended RN-BSN potentially increases numbers, qualification of nurses while providing rural HIV care, primary health services and remaining available for their families. This model not only improves nurses retention but also unlocks growth opportunities for nurses and may be adapted for direct entry training. Deeper evaluation of the program is underway to determine satisfaction, appropriateness of learning methods and content.

%X Learning may be enhanced in mental health nursing education by applying virtual reality technologies in which students may safely practice communication and assessment skills with simulated patients. The purpose of this descriptive study was to assess the effectiveness of a Second Life® (SL) virtual simulation as a teaching strategy for undergraduate mental health nursing students. Data were collected via a researcher-developed survey questionnaire. Students perceived the simulation to be moderately effective as an educational strategy and slightly difficult as a technical program. Positive aspects included client assessment in an environment where mistakes were without consequence, working from home, and novelty. Drawbacks were dressing and maneuvering the avatar and lack of realism. Correlations were found between educational effectiveness and technical difficulty and between educational effectiveness and age of the computer. SL virtual simulation has potential to provide unique, easily accessible, safe, and fun learning for mental health nursing students. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the period of retention of ACLS skills is different between medical students and registered nurses. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed. Medical students and registered nurses were trained both BLS and ACLS based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 2005 Guidelines tools, and evaluated by skill performance tests based on the AHA 2005 BLS and ACLS tools in simulated environment, at immediately and 3 months after training. The registered nurses were similarly evaluated also at 9 months after training. RESULTS: A total of 197 medical students enrolled was trained, being assigned to 30 groups. Twenty four registered nurses in a general ward were trained, being assigned to 6 groups. In 3 months after training, the medical students retained the core skills of chest compression, which included the correct rate and adequate depth of chest compressions, delivering 30 compressions and 2 ventilations, and resuming chest compressions after shocks, whereas checking breathing, 2 ventilations with bag-valve-mask, or checking carotid pulse was done in only 33% of all groups. The airway management and drug use in the secondary ACLS survey and the effective communication and team dynamics were done in 30%-50% of all groups. The registered nurses also retained the core skills of chest compression and drug use in 3 months after training. Especially, effective communication and team dynamics were well-retained in all groups. In 9 months after training the registered nurses also retained, whereas both opening airway and first 2 ventilations were done in 50% of all groups. Checking carotid pulse or checking breathing was little done for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: Through BLS and ACLS training, the registered nurses have well retained resuscitation skills, but they also have well demonstrated effective communication and team dynamics for longer period than medical students. Medical students are required short interval of retraining ACLS skills with team dynamics, similarly healthcare providers without performing resuscitation as daily work may be. In addition to this, it should be important to apply effectively different way to teach ACLS skills, such as e-learning or self-training.

%X The transfer of health-related research knowledge between producers and users is a complex, dynamic and iterative process. There has been little research describing the preferred knowledge transfer strategies used by different stakeholder groups, including healthcare providers, policymakers and administrators. The purpose of the survey was to gain an understanding of the content and preferred dissemination strategies of knowledge users of briefing notes about the effectiveness of advanced practice nursing (APN) roles in Canada. An on-line cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2011 to January 2012. Purposeful sampling was used to identify the target audience. The questionnaire included six items. The response rate was 44% (n=75/170). Participants identified that the briefing note should concisely summarize definitions for APN roles and information about the safety, effectiveness, cost savings and effective role implementation strategies. Multiple approaches were favoured to disseminate the information. Preferred dissemination strategies included personalized emails, meeting with briefing note recipients, engaging nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in organizations where APN roles have been successfully implemented, engaging the media and using social media. The use of briefing notes has shown promise. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of tailored briefing notes.

%X Objective: Oncology nurses should have a high level of sensitivity while dealingwith the sexual health needs of patients. This study was a part of a problem-based e-learning (e-PBL) program in sexual health care for oncology nurses and aimed at developing video-based PBL cases. Methods: The video-based PBL cases were developed through processes involving analysis, design, development, and evaluation phases. The analysis phase included the study of essential contents and learner analysis. For the latter, focus group interviews were conducted for ten oncology nurses. In the design phase, the goals and activities of learning were established with the help of specific cases. Video-based PBL cases were produced in the development phase and tested for validity in the evaluation phase by three physicians, i.e., one professor of education technology and two professors of nursing. Results: Video-based PBL cases about 3-5 min long were developed for five cases, which included breast cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and colorectal cancer. These video-based cases were evaluated by Kenny and Beagan's questions and criteria; the findings proved that these cases considered major crisis points and were explained from the patient's point of view in the patient's language. Conclusion: Video-based case studies will enhance PBL programs and offer a more complete and holistic view of the patient as a human being and cultivate professional researchers specialized in e-PBL programs; these factors are essential for the radically changing medical environment and health needs of the subjects.

During the first semester of 2005, 64 Nursing students of a college were subjected to the e-learning multimedia contents for PBL. This course was blended so that part of the class sessions were held in a face to face setting and the other classes were held online. Learners' reactions and their instructional performance were measured.E-learning multimedia contents, composed of a learning contents system, PBL systems and an administrator/professor system, were developed. Ratings of their reactions as learners and of instructional performance averaged 3.3 points and 3.9 points (on a scale of 5) respectively. Some benefits of this program as reported by the learners are: the moving pictures similar to clinical situations, distinctive experience, ease of understanding, time saving, repetitive learning, etc. The nursing students reported this program was a positive experience and that it encouraged self-directed learning.

%X BACKGROUND: An acute ankle sprain is a sudden-onset injury of one or more of the ankle ligaments. It is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in the general population as well as in athletes. In some countries, such as China and Korea, acupuncture is frequently used in the treatment of ankle sprains, either as a single treatment or a secondary intervention accompanied by standard medical treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to May week 2 2013), China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994 to August week 4 2013), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1937 to May 2013), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (1985 to May 2013), Science Links Japan (1996 to August week 4 2013), several Korean medical databases (August week 4 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (August week 4 2013), the bibliographic references of included trials and conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving adults with acute ankle sprains. We included all types of acupuncture practices, such as needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, pharmacoacupuncture, non-penetrating acupuncture point stimulation (e.g. acupressure and magnets) and moxibustion. Acupuncture could be compared with control (no treatment or placebo) or another standard non-surgical intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses using the fixed-effect method or, where appropriate, the random-effects method, and used 95% confidence intervals (CI) throughout. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 20 heterogeneous studies (2012 participants with acute ankle sprains); three of which included more than one comparison. Seventeen trials were conducted in China. All of the studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The results may also have been affected by selection bias, particularly as five studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and 12 studies gave no information on their method of randomisation. Of our three prespecified primary outcomes, only cure rate was reported by the majority of studies. No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function and only one reported on adverse events (in which three participants receiving a control intervention experienced skin problems from over-the-counter Chinese herbal patches). The other 19 studies did not record or report on adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence for cure rates as very low for all comparisons, which means we are very uncertain about the reliability of any of the estimates.The single study comparing acupuncture treatment with no treatment found acupuncture to be more effective with regard to cure rate at five days (31/31 versus 1/30; RR 20.34, 95% CI 4.27 to 96.68). Acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone was tested in eight studies; with cure rate data available for seven. Most of these studies reported higher cure rates in the acupuncture plus another standard treatment group than in the standard treatment alone group. However, while the results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from eight trials testing acupuncture versus no acupuncture tended to favour acupuncture, the results were very inconsistent across the studies and the estimated effect was very imprecise (383/396 versus 272/355; RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84; P value = 0.1; I(2) = 98%).Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese drug patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, oral Chinese herbal medicine and elastic bandage. Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test. The results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from 11 trials testing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to slightly favour acupuncture, but these were not statistically significant and the data were very heterogeneous (404/509 versus 416/497; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22; P value = 0.30; I(2) = 92%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available evidence from a very heterogeneous group of randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of acute ankle sprains does not provide reliable support for either the effectiveness or safety of acupuncture treatments, alone or in combination with other non-surgical interventions; or in comparison with other non-surgical interventions. Future rigorous randomised clinical trials with larger sample sizes will be necessary to establish robust clinical evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for acute ankle sprains.

%X Purpose: Simulation training has been recommended as a specific intervention for lack of self-efficacy of healthcare providers in therapeutic hypothermia (TH) implementation for post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a simulation-based post-cardiac arrest care and TH training course for hospital educators improve the participants' self-assessed knowledge, competence, and confidence for each learning objective at the end of the course and impact on their facilitating performance at the provider training courses. Materials and methods: A pilot full-day, simulation-based post-cardiac arrest care and TH training course for hospital educators was developed and applied to physician and nursing educators. The course was consisted of a lecture, 4 small group workshop sessions, and 4 patient simulation sessions. The participants' self-assessed knowledge, competence, and confidence for each learning objective were assessed before and after the course using a survey. The participants' facilitating performance during smallgroup workshop session at 4-hour provider training courses were recorded and assessed by two independent raters independently using a checklist for pre-defined 10 core educator's activities. Results: A total of 32 hospital educators (14 physicians and 18 nurses) participated in two pilot courses. Overall satisfaction level to the courses was very positive [13 (41%) rated as “good” and 18 (56%) rated as “excellent”]. Their self-assessed knowledge, competence, and confidence for each learning objective were significantly improved at the end of the course compared to those before the course (p < 0.05, respectively). The facilitating performance score (mean±SD) of the educators during small-group workshop session at the provider training courses were 72.1±19.3 in physician educators and 76.3±9.7 in nurse educators. Conclusions: A simulation-based post-cardiac arrest care and TH training course may be a useful way to improve hospital educators' self-efficacy for post-cardiac arrest care and TH and their facilitating performance at the provider training courses.

%X Background: Interprofessional education (IPE) and practice have become key components of health care throughout the world. It is clear from the literature that patients benefit when professionals collaborate to ensure completeness of care. Within the care of people living with respiratory conditions, physiotherapists routinely work in interprofessional teams. To help physiotherapy students prepare for their future professional roles there is a need for them to be involved in IPE. Purpose: The overall purpose of this study was to examine the impact of interprofessional workshops, on the six Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative competencies: communication, collaboration, patient-centred care, roles and responsibilities, team functioning, and conflict resolution. Another objective was to see if these workshops could be used to enhance the respiratory care skills of students. Methods: This study examined three different interprofessional workshops; (1) using exclusively simulated patients, (2) the combination of standardized and simulated patients, and (3) exclusively standardized patients. 82 students from nursing, physiotherapy and respiratory therapy programs worked together in simulation based activities to plan and implement care for a patient with a respiratory condition. Using a mixed method approach both quantitative and qualitative data were collected including using the Interprofessional Collaborative Competencies Attainment Survey (ICCAS). Results: Qualitative data from student participants indicated that that they found their interprofessional teams did well with communication and collaboration. But the participants felt they could have better involved the patients/their family members in the patient's care. Quantitative results demonstrates a significant difference between workshops in all of the competencies, with the exception of communication. The biggest different in pre-post means were in Conflict Management (2.35 (± 0.20)) in Patient-Centred Approach (1.54 (± 0.25)) and Team Functioning (1.59 (± 0.08)). Conclusion(s): The quantitative and qualitative data reveal some interesting trends in students' perceptions of IPE competencies in different simulation scenarios. Consistently across all workshops and data sets, communication was a competency that students felt they were strong in before participation in the interprofessional workshop. This is contrary to sources previously cited that demonstrate that one of the main benefits of simulation in IPE is to improve communication. It was also evident from the qualitative data that students were nervous/anxious before the scenario, but many felt that they had gained skills thatwould be useful inworking with patients with respiratory conditions. Another noteworthy point was for most of the participants, this was their first exposure to an IPE activity, although many were near the end of their educational program. Implications: Although physiotherapists work in interprofessional teams daily, it is a challenge to coordinate IPE opportunities for students but this study found that it was a valuable activity. Findings indicate that regardless of method used, whether more high tech (patient simulation) or lowtech (standardized patients), students found the simulation experience beneficial and appreciated the opportunity to work with and better understand the roles of collaborating health care professionals.

%X Background: Effective pain management remains a challenge for adolescents during conscious burn wound care procedures. Virtual reality (VR) shows promise as a non-pharmacological adjunct in reducing pain. Aims: This study assessed off-the-shelf VR for (1) its effect on reducing acute pain intensity during adolescent burn wound care, and (2) its clinical utility in a busy hospital setting. Methods: Forty-one adolescents (11-17 years) participated in this prospective randomized controlled trial. Acute pain outcomes including adolescent self-report, nursing staff behavioral observation, caregiver observation and physiological measures were collected. Length of procedure times and adolescent reactions were also recorded to inform clinical utility. Results: Nursing staff reported a statistically significant reduction in pain scores during dressing removal, and significantly less rescue doses of Entonox given to those receiving VR, compared to those receiving standard distraction. For all other pain outcomes and length of treatment, there was a trend for lower pain scores and treatment times for those receiving VR, but these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Despite only minimal pain reduction achieved using off-the-shelf VR, other results from this trial and previous research on younger children with burns suggest a customized, adolescent and hospital friendly device may be more effective in pain reduction.

%X Learning Objectives: Though mechanical ventilation weaning protocols are now widely used in most hospitals, disjointed coordination of services can often impede overall outcomes. Sedation management and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) must work symbiotically to liberate patients from ventilation. When well-managed, respiratory therapy, nursing, and physician teams can impact ventilator length of stay, improve patient flow, and control costs via earlier extubation. Methods: A “Rise and Shine Committee” was established to map current practice and determine where improvements were necessary. These efforts focused on protocolized sedation for a targeted RASS score, patient screening, SBT compliance, and earlier extubation approval. Two 20 bed medical and surgical units were chosen to determine whether enhanced communication and practice improved work flow. The previous screen and trial processes for sedation were streamlined and then combined with the SBT process to one flow diagram and policy. This focus led to more positive SBT screens and SBT trials where extubation potential was identified more often in the first 30 minutes. Results: Pre-trial, screened patients would remain on SBTs for greater than the policy stipulated 2 hour SBT period (3.1 hrs), with 86% of vented patients being screened and only 73% of positive screens progressing to SBT. After intervention, SBTs were reduced to 1.5 hours, with SBT screen compliance increasing to 93% and 89% of positive screens progressing to SBT. Conclusions: An interdisciplinary committee structure provided the platform to promote common initiatives and to share results across multiple intensive care areas. The focus on RASS for continued sedation management has enhanced the SBT process by allowing more patients to be screen positively for SBT trials. Respiratory therapists and nurses are able to more effectively function as key members of the decision team.

%X Background: UK NEQAS for Blood Coagulation provides EQA for INR testing in both laboratory and Point of Care (POC) setting for many years. However an EQA programme for monitoring the dosing of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) following an INR test does not exist. Aims: To introduce of an EQA programme for assessment of the VKA dosing. Methods: A pilot study was performed with a virtual patient scenario of INR results and dates together with a short clinical history. Users provide a dosage and recall time for the patient using their routine method. Users that were dosing manually could also take part. The survey was open to both the laboratory and POC based users in UK NEQAS BC INR programmes. Results: 324 centres returned results with 26% from laboratory programme and 61% from the POC programme (the remainder entering data anonymously). The virtual patient's results were INR of 2.7, 2.9, 3.4, 3.8 on day 35, day 14, day 7 and day 0 respectively on a constant dose of 7 mg per day of warfarin. Dosage recommendations ranged from 0 to 8 mg per day. 90% of centres suggested a dose of between 6 and 7 mg per day with a further 8% recommending a dose of between 5 and < 6 mg per day. The highest dose of 8 mg/day was stated by only one centre. Recall intervals ranged from 2 days to 28 days with a median of 7 days (n = 214 centres). 39% of dosing for this virtual patient was performed manually and 39% was performed using the CDSS recommendation (13 different systems). The remaining 22% used the CDSS but varied either the dose (8%) or the recall period (4%) or both (10%). Nurses were most often performing the exercise (49%) with doctors (19%), health care assistants (15%), laboratory scientists (15%), pharmacists (6%) and a practice manager also taking part. Conclusions: Good agreement was seen in this first exercise with 90% recommending a dose of between 6 and 7 mg per day and 78% giving a recall time of 7 days. However we feel that post analytical EQA is required to bring standardisation to this area and highlight differences to users.

%X Background: The ALS Association Greater Philadelphia Chapter patient service staff sought to understand the needs of newly diagnosed patients and their families during the period shortly after diagnosis. Many services and programs are available, but there is no information on the usefulness of these services to patients and families. Objectives: To seek information about coping behaviours and services utilized by patients and family members in the first 6 months following diagnosis of ALS. Methods: An evidence based practice model was utilized. A review of the literature did not identify research addressing these specific needs during the 6-month period following diagnosis. A focus group of expert clinicians in ALS care (social workers, a nurse, and a counsellor) developed a survey. Persons with ALS (PALS) diagnosed in the previous 2 years and their family members were contacted by email or via the postal service and asked to complete the survey. Results: Four hundred and seventeen people were contacted by conventional mail with a response rate of 22.2%, whereas 278 were contacted by email with a response rate was 23.7%, giving a total response rate of 22.8%. 50.3% of respondents were PALS and 49.7% were family members. There were no significant differences between the PALS or family groups on any items. Responses were therefore combined. The most helpful services were the first clinic visit (79%) information (59%) and support groups (22%). 80% sought information outside of the physician appointment, with the internet as most common source. Only 31% wished to meet others during this period. Responses to what helped coping during this period were, from most to least frequent responses: (1) Friends and family; (2) ALS Clinic visit; (3) Gathering information; (4) Spiritual life; (5) Own perspective; and (6) Avoidance. When asked what else would be helpful, only 50% responded and those responses were split between an in-person, or web-based seminar, 'webinar' . Only 2.2% reported attending a newly diagnosed seminar, responding that they did not do so because it was inconvenient (43%); they were not aware (38%); or they were not ready (33%). Discussion and conclusion: PALS and their families have similar coping experiences and behaviours in the first 6 months following diagnosis. The primary coping strategies focus on information seeking, expert medical care at a multidisciplinary clinic and connecting with others. The results of this survey are being used to evaluate and guide services for the ALS chapter.

%X Objective: To identify, catalog, and critically evaluate Web-based resources for critical care education. Data Sources: A multilevel search strategy was utilized. Literature searches were conducted (from 1996 to September 30, 2010) using OVID-MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature with the terms "Web-based learning," "computer-assisted instruction," "e-learning, " "critical care," "tutorials," "continuing education," "virtual learning," and "Web-based education." The Web sites of relevant critical care organizations (American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Thoracic Society, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care Medicine, World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine, American Association of Critical Care Nurses, and World Federation of Critical Care Nurses) were reviewed for the availability of e-learning resources. Finally, Internet searches and e-mail queries to critical care medicine fellowship program directors and members of national and international acute/critical care listserves were conducted to 1) identify the use of and 2) review and critique Web-based resources for critical care education. Data Extraction and Data Synthesis: To ensure credibility of Web site information, Web sites were reviewed by three independent reviewers on the basis of the criteria of authority, objectivity, authenticity, accuracy, timeliness, relevance, and efficiency in conjunction with suggested formats for evaluating Web sites in the medical literature. Measurements and Main Results: Literature searches using OVID-MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature resulted in >250 citations. Those pertinent to critical care provide examples of the integration of e-learning techniques, the development of specific resources, reports of the use of types of e-learning, including interactive tutorials, case studies, and simulation, and reports of student or learner satisfaction, among other general reviews of the benefits of utilizing e-learning. Review of the Web sites of relevant critical care organizations revealed the existence of a number of e-learning resources, including online critical care courses, tutorials, podcasts, webcasts, slide sets, and continuing medical education resources, some requiring membership or a fee to access. Respondents to listserve queries (>100) and critical care medicine fellowship director and advanced practice nursing educator e-mail queries (>50) identified the use of a number of tutorials, self-directed learning modules, and video-enhanced programs for critical care education and practice. Conclusions: In all, >135 Web-based education resources exist, including video Web resources for critical care education in a variety of e-learning formats, such as tutorials, self-directed learning modules, interactive case studies, webcasts, podcasts, and video-enhanced programs. As identified by critical care educators and practitioners, e-learning is actively being integrated into critical care medicine and nursing training programs for continuing medical education and competency training purposes. Knowledge of available Web-based educational resources may enhance critical care practitioners ongoing learning and clinical competence, although this has not been objectively measured to date. © 2011 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

%X OBJECTIVES: To identify rehabilitation interventions that can be integrated into ward-based nursing for patients with hemispatial neglect following stroke in the right brain hemisphere. DESIGN: A systematic review of interdisciplinary literature. DATA SOURCES: A preliminary literature search without time limits was conducted in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. We then searched the PubMed, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases for relevant articles published between January 2006 and June 2014. Selected journals were searched manually. Additional resources were explored by scrutinizing reference lists and tracking citations of the selected articles. REVIEW METHODS: Titles and abstracts were matched with the inclusion criteria. Articles were read in their entirety if the abstracts adhered to inclusion criteria or if there was any uncertainty. Two reviewers evaluated the risk of methodological bias independently by using quantitative appraisal forms from the Johanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Authors of nine studies were contacted to acquire additional information. The JBI Reviewers' Manual was used to guide the overall procedure of the review. We used the PRISMA statement to ensure precise reporting of the results. The selected studies were graded according to the strength of their evidence (Levels 1-5); the proposed interventions were given recommendation grades (Grades A-D). RESULTS: Using 41 original studies, 11 interventions were identified. These comprise: (1) contralesional neck vibration (Grade C); (2) emotionally salient stimuli and reward (Grade D); (3) family participation and intensity of training (Grade C); (4) limb activation training (Grade C); (5) mental imagery training, (Grade D); (6) mirror therapy (Grade C); (7) music therapy (Grade D); (8) right half-field eye patching (Grade D); (9) smooth pursuit eye-movement training (Grade B); (10) virtual reality and computer-based training (Grade C); and (11) visual scanning training (Grade D). CONCLUSION: A total of 11 promising rehabilitation interventions were found. Encouraging results were, in particular, seen with smooth pursuit eye-movement training. It should be noted that the general low level of evidence and the diversity of interventions makes it difficult to endorse specific priorities and combinations for implementation. Instead, interventions should be applied after careful evaluation of each patient's unique capacities and problems. We include suggestions for operationalization into ward-based care in "Discussion" section. We also emphasize the need to integrate evidence-based interventions into nursing care to further stimulate rehabilitation outcomes and future research.

%X Background: Nurse-led gastrointestinal endoscopy is a priority clinical area in the UK. Endoscopic procedures are challenging to learn, requiring a combination of technical competence (manipulating a flexible endoscope and interpreting the findings) and interpersonal skills (engaging effectively with a conscious patient who is frequently apprehensive). This paper explores the potential of an innovative, scenario-based approach which links a simulated patient with a computer-driven virtual reality (VR) training device for flexible sigmoidoscopy. Within this safe yet realistic quasi-clinical environment, learners carry out the procedure while interacting with the 'patient'. Communication skills are assessed by simulated patients, while quantitative performance data relating to the procedure is generated automatically by the VR simulator. Methods: This pilot study took place within a nurse practitioner endoscopy course. A mixed methodology combined qualitative and quantitative data (observation and interview studies, communication rating scales and a range of computer-generated output measures from the VR simulator) in a multifaceted evaluation. Results: Seven nurses took part in the study. Participants found the scenarios to be a convincing and powerful learning experience. All experienced high levels of anxiety. Simulated patients identified strengths in participants' communication skills, together with areas for development. Simulator-based practice led to an improvement in objective performance measures. Discussion: Scenario-based training provides a powerful learning experience, allowing participants to build their technical expertise and apply it within a holistic clinical context without the risk of causing harm. We used this pilot study as a springboard for discussions over wider implications of procedure-based skills training, locating it within the literature on expertise and situated learning.

%X Introduction In the United Kingdom, practical training in neonatal resuscitation is a requirement for neonatal practitioners. Good quality, effective resuscitation can improve short and long term outcomes and prevent many immediate perinatal complications. Resuscitation skills deteriorate rapidly if not used daily. A particularly rapid loss of skills occurs in the first 3-6 months after attending a resuscitation course. Currently there is no formal program for refresher training in neonatal resuscitation skills in the four year period until mandatory recertification. E-learning and video based training has been shown to be an effective means of teaching and refreshing adult and paediatric resuscitation skills. Aims/Method This study evaluated whether a 'refresher' training video could improve performance in neonatal healthcare professionals. We produced a 3 min video with voiceover, demonstrating key neonatal resuscitation skills. Eighty six clinical staff members (32 midwives, 31 neonatal nurses and 23 doctors) volunteered to participate in the study; their neonatal resuscitation skills were assessed before and after viewing the video. Results There was a statistically significant improvement in all skills assessed across all professional groups after viewing the video. Key results: 59% of midwives delivered effective inflation breaths pre video compared to 96% post video (P = 0.0005). Nurses' checking of the correct set up of resuscitation equipment improved from 64% to 93% (P = 0.0001). Sixty-five percent of doctors checked the Positive End-Expiratory (PEEP) pressures before seeing the video, increasing to 100% afterwards (P = 0.0072). Conclusion Videos such as this could form part of a training package available to staff who wish to refresh their resuscitation skills through self-directed learning, or become part of mandatory training updates.

%X A new web based network aims at the improvement of health care in Europe by integrating advanced e-learning and e-publishing technologies for the training of medical doctors, nurses, and students. The field of application is sleep physiology and sleep medicine. Based on a multilingual, multimedia communication system, ENN-ICS Centre offers direct access to medical information for users, i.e healthcare professionals and citizens, in Europe and worldwide. The use of XML supports the development of media independent contents for multiple target groups. Editorial and distributive processes are supported by customized central editorial, content management and learning management systems (CMS, LMS). ENN-ICS e-health services are evaluated by selected user groups in North, Middle and Southern Europe using reliable and scientifically accepted validation instruments. The compliance with essential quality requirements and criteria is tested and verified by using online questionnaires based on the DISCERN questionnaire for evaluating patient information, the HON principles for health-related websites and the GMDS catalogue of quality criteria for electronic publications in medicine. The system architecture and its exemplary applications can be used as a model for future e-health services dealing with neurological and other medical topics.

%X OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the feasibility of training primary care providers in the delivery of dementia care in New Mexico using the Project ECHO™ model. BACKGROUND: Aging of the baby boom generation is creating an epidemic of dementia. Concern for adequate delivery of dementia care, including diagnosis, treatment and management, has prompted calls for more professionals, more training and more resources to handle this need. Project ECHO™, a lifelong learning and guided practice model revolutionizes medical education and exponentially increases workforce capacity to provide bestpractice specialty care and reduce health disparities. The University of New Mexico applied this model of distance education to the scarcity of expert dementia care in our state. DESIGN/METHODS: Local experts in neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry, nursing, social work, pharmacy and from community partner NM Alzheimer Association were recruited. A network of community primary care providers, clinics, homecare and other interested professionals were identified. Biweekly multi-point videoconference virtual clinics were held over two years. Clinics consist of case presentation and discussion and a didactic on dementia-related topics. No-cost CME/CUE is an incentive. RESULTS: Two full curricular cycles are complete. Consultations were provided for 43 individuals. More than 450 hours of CME/CEU were granted. Professionals have called in from across the country and the world. Members of 15 different professional disciplines have participated. Evaluation over the term averaged 4.8 on a 1 to 5 scale. The ECHO Dementia Care Clinic serves as a platform for interprofessional education for 8 schools and programs at the University. CONCLUSIONS: The Project ECHO model has proven to be an effective tool for dementia care education and training in the state of New Mexico. The next phase, certification of Centers of Excellence in Dementia Care, is in the planning stages.

%X OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the feasibility of training primary care professionals in the delivery of dementia care in New Mexico using the Project ECHO™ model. BACKGROUND: Aging of the baby boom generation is creating an epidemic of dementia. Concern for adequate delivery of dementia care, including diagnosis, treatment and management, has prompted calls for more professionals, more training and more resources to handle this need. Project ECHO™ is a lifelong learning and guided practice model that revolutionizes medical education and exponentially increases workforce capacity to provide best-practice specialty care and reduce health disparities. The University of New Mexico applied this model of distance education to the scarcity of expert dementia care in our state. METHODS: Local experts in neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry, nursing, social work, pharmacy, rehabilitation therapies and community partner Alzheimer Association were recruited. A network of community primary care outpatient clinics, homecare agencies, extended care communities and other interested professionals were identified. Biweekly multi-point videoconference virtual clinics were held over two years. Clinics consist of case presentations with discussion and a didactic on dementia and dementia-related topics. No-cost CME/CUE served as an incentive. RESULTS: Two full curricular cycles are complete. Consultations were provided for 43 individuals. More than 450 hours of CME/ CEU were granted. Professionals have participated from across the country and around the world. Members of 15 different professional disciplines have received CME/CUEs. Evaluation over the term averaged 4.8 on a 5 point scale. ECHO™ Dementia Care Clinic also serves as a platform for interprofessional education for 8 schools and programs at the University. CONCLUSIONS: The Project ECHO™ model has proven to be an effective tool for dementia care education and training in the state of New Mexico. The next phase, certification of Centers of Excellence in Dementia Care, is in the planning stages.

%X Background: One area of emergency medicine education that takes advantage of rapidly advancing technologies is simulation education. Just setting foot in a modern simulation center is often like stepping into the future. Two areas in particular that show promise are ever-improving video capture including seamless 360 degree recording, and the emergence of lower cost virtual reality technology. These technologies can be joined to provide immersive video feedback to learners following a simulated patient encounter. In particular, it can help the learner see things from the patient perspective. Objective: Provide immersive, meaningful feedback to emergency medicine residents using 360 video review. Utilize patient perspective virtual reality view to improve the simulation debriefing process. Methods: Emergency medicine residents were asked to evaluate and treat a critically ill patient in a hybrid simulation case. The patient had respiratory distress and required BiPAP, intubation, and chest tube. A 360Fly camera ($399) was mounted on the chest of the simulated patient and controlled over wifi from a smartphone at the control station. High resolution video and audio were recorded by the 360Fly. Immediately following the case, learners were debriefed. They were able to watch their video and audio on an iPhone inserted into a cardboard viewer (Google Cardboard, $15). This gave them a three-dimensional, 360 degree view of the recorded case. They could look up and down, and turn their head to see the entire room during the video review. Learners could watch the vital signs, see when medications were administered by the nurse, and review the tube thoracotomy procedure. Results: Learners were surveyed on their experience following the debriefing session. 14 responses were collected. 79% (11/14) felt that the video added a unique and helpful perspective of the case. 71% (10/14) felt that the 360 video helped them see things that happened during the case they they otherwise would not have seen. 71% (10/14) stated they would want to use the 360 video review again during future simulation sessions. Conclusions: The combination of 360 degree video capture and low-cost virtual reality shows promise in augmenting the simulated patient encounter. In this small pilot study we have shown the feasibility of using this technology. Future directions would include other scenarios that focus on provider-patient interaction such as shared decision making, breaking bad news, and end-of-life care discussions..

%X The presentation is about an intervention that aims to improve the level of basic knowledge amongst health professionals regarding treatment on the level of basic palliative care. A recent Danish government report [i] has shown that there is a great variation in basic level palliative care. Furthermore, the report also stated that there is a need to focus on the early stages of palliative care as well as on the palliative care of non-malignant conditions. Palliative intervention takes place in all three health care sectors: Hospital, municipal care services and general practice. The intervention involves nurses, doctors and health care assistants. Time is a precious commodity for patients, and health professionals often lack this vital commodity. This often creates a challenge when there is a need for building professional competences. The intervention comprises short films and group based e-learning that can be executed locally; as opposed to teaching in a classroom. The methods chosen in the intervention are flexible: The intervention has been tested over 10 workshops covering the palliative care of malignant, as well as nonmalignant conditions. We would like to present the results and discuss some of the important aspects of the workshops. We would also like to address the subject of the education of health professionals whose primary focus and task is not necessarily palliative treatment. Our aim is, from the time of diagnosis, to facilitate coherence in the palliative care process across all sectors.(Table Presented).

%X Introduction. Training in demanding professional environments, such as that of an ICU, combines theoretical knowledge, practical skills, integration of information technology (IT) into clinical practice and attitude formation tailored to extreme conditions. It is also a challenge for Health Education and IT, given the high standards (zero tolerance for errors), high cost, time constraints and the proven inefficiency of conventional educational methodology. 'Teleprometheus' is a novel e-learning platform for ICU professionals and patients' relatives, comprising four distinct components: a) An e-learning platform (Moodle), b) virtual classrooms (Blackboard Collaborate), c) Interactive Infokiosks, installed inside the ICU (guidelines, protocols, checklists and educational videos for health professionals) and outside the ICU (information for relatives). OBJECTIVES. To propose a novel approach to the design of an integrated educational program tailored to state-of-the-art IT services. METHODS. To determine the educational needs (thus the content and priorities), we considered the following parameters: (a) Perceived needs of each professional team determined by questionnaires, (b) Clinical audit, based on real data from the European 'PROSAFE' quality assessment consortium and (c) Peer assessment by senior ICU staff. Relevant educational processes have pre-defined learning objectives and expected outcomes. Clinical competency is perceived as: (a) theoretical knowledge adequacy, (b) practical skills mastery and (c) proposed attitude adoption (Fig. 1). RESULTS. Physicians rated procedures on a priority scale (1: low to 5:utmost) as follows : difficult airway management (mean (SE)) 4.1 (0.9), mechanical ventilation 4.0 (1.7) and ultrasound use 3.7 (1.1). ICU nurses self-rated skills on a competency scale (1: incompetent to 5: excellent) as follows: HFO 2.4 (1.3), CRRT devices 3.6 (1.4) and cardiac output measurement devices 3.7 (1.1). Regarding nurses' educational needs, however, both PROSAFE metrics and senior staff's opinion identified catheter-related bloodstream infections as a top-priority issue. Therefore, priority was given to the development of relevant training modules by means of lectures and seminars on Moodle, professional educational videos and the use of interactive screens and mute displays for easy retrieval/ projection of educational material in the working environment. Similar approach will be followed for other educational needs. CONCLUSION. Triangulating perceived clinical needs, outcome metrics and expert peerreview feedback, can tailor continuous professional education to the local ICU needs. Future perspectives include individualization of training programs, 'injection' of educational material into the actual clinical practice and integration of other novel solutions, such as m-Educator and virtual patients.

%X Quick changes on the field of informational communication technologies forces educational and other institutions to think about different ways of teaching and learning in both formal and informal environments. It addition it is well known that due to fast advancement of science and technology the knowledge gained in schools is getting out-of-date rapidly, so life long learning is becoming an essential alternative. As a consequence we are facing a rapid development and use of new educational approaches such as e-learning, simulations, virtual reality, etc. They brought a revolution to learning and instruction. But in general the empirical results of e-learning studies are somewhat disappointing. They cannot prove the superiority of e-learning processes over traditional learning in general, neither in specific areas like nursing. In our international study we proved that e-Learning can have many benefits and that it can enhance learning experience in nursing education, but it has to be provided in correct manner.

%X Patient education in a pediatric setting is unique. There are different patient ages, degrees of learning, and diagnoses to take into account when educating children and their families. A new and innovative trend in practice called Interactive Patient Care (IPC) integrates technology into care processes to advance pediatric nursing education and patient and family satisfaction. Children's Specialized Hospital is the first pediatric rehabilitation hospital to develop and implement this type of program using an IPC platform from the GetWellNetwork. With the implementation of the GetWellNetwork, Children's Specialized Hospital has achieved positive results in patient satisfaction, health care utilization, quality, and safety measures.

%X Education on the care of aggressive and disturbed patients is fragmentary. eLearning could ensure the quality of such education, but data on its impact on professional competence of the staff are insufficient. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of ePsychNurse.Net, an eLearning course, on psychiatric nurses' professional competence in seclusion and restraint and on their job satisfaction and general self-efficacy. The study showed that the ePsychNurse.Net, an affordable and easy-to-access learning instrument may, with certain reservations, be recommended for the continuing vocational education of nursing staff in psychiatric institutions. ePsychNurse.Net is worth further development with more flexible time schedules and individualization of content. Education on the care of aggressive and disturbed patients is fragmentary. eLearning could ensure the quality of such education, but data on its impact on professional competence in psychiatry are lacking. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of ePsychNurse.Net, an eLearning course, on psychiatric nurses' professional competence in seclusion and restraint and on their job satisfaction and general self-efficacy. In a randomized controlled study, 12 wards were randomly assigned to ePsychNurse.Net (intervention) or education as usual (control). Baseline and 3-month follow-up data on nurses' knowledge of coercion-related legislation, physical restraint and seclusion, their attitudes towards physical restraint and seclusion, job satisfaction and general self-efficacy were analysed for 158 completers. Knowledge (primary outcome) of coercion-related legislation improved in the intervention group, while knowledge of physical restraint improved and knowledge of seclusion remained unchanged in both groups. General self-efficacy improved in the intervention group also attitude to seclusion in the control group. In between-group comparison, attitudes to seclusion (one of secondary outcomes) favoured the control group. Although the ePsychNurse.Net demonstrated only slight advantages over conventional learning, it may be worth further development with, e.g. flexible time schedule and individualized content. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing.

%X Background: The management of psychiatric inpatients exhibiting severely disturbed and aggressive behaviour is an important educational topic. Well structured, IT-based educational programmes (eLearning) often ensure quality and may make training more affordable and accessible. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of an eLearning course for personnel on the rates and duration of seclusion and mechanical restraint among psychiatric inpatients. Methods: In a cluster-randomized intervention trial, the nursing personnel on 10 wards were randomly assigned to eLearning (intervention) or training-as-usual (control) groups. The eLearning course comprised six modules with specific topics (legal and ethical issues, behaviour-related factors, therapeutic relationship and self-awareness, teamwork and integrating knowledge with practice) and specific learning methods. The rates (incidents per 1000 occupied bed days) and durations of the coercion incidents were examined before and after the course. Results: A total of 1283 coercion incidents (1143 seclusions [89%] and 140 incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints [11%]) were recorded on the study wards during the data collection period. On the intervention wards, there were no statistically significant changes in the rates of seclusion and mechanical restraint. However, the duration of incidents involving mechanical restraints shortened from 36.0 to 4.0 h (median) (P < 0.001). No statistically significant changes occurred on the control wards. Conclusions: After our eLearning course, the duration of incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints decreased. However, more studies are needed to ensure that the content of the course focuses on the most important factors associated with the seclusion-related elements. The eLearning course deserves further development and further studies. The duration of coercion incidents merits attention in future research.

%X The nursing literature supports the need for end-of-life (EOL) education, but the ability to provide quality clinical experience in this area is limited by the availability of patients and nursing instructors' and preceptors' comfort and expertise in teaching EOL care. Clinical simulation allows faculty to provide the same quality EOL experience to all students. This article discusses an effective teaching strategy integrating End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium core content with National League for Nursing ACE.S unfolding case studies, clinical simulation, and social media.

%X Background: Communities of practice (CoPs) have been used in the health sector to support professional practice change. However, little is known about how CoPs might be used to influence a system that requires change at and across various levels (i.e. front line care, organizational, governmental). In this paper we examine the experience of a CoP in the Canadian province of Ontario as it engages in improving the care of seniors. Our aim is to shed light on using CoPs to facilitate systems change. Methods: This paper draws on year one findings of a larger multiple case study that is aiming to increase understanding of knowledge translation processes mobilized through CoPs. In this paper we strategically report on one case to illustrate a critical example of a CoP trying to effect systems change. Primary data included semi-structured interviews with CoP members (n = 8), field notes from five planning meetings, and relevant background documents. Data analysis included deductive coding (i.e. pre-determined codes aligned with the larger project) and inductive coding which allowed codes and themes to emerge. A thorough description of the case was prepared using all the coded data. Results: The CoP recognized a need to support health professionals (nurses, dentists) and related paraprofessionals with knowledge, experience, and resources to appropriately address their clients' oral health care needs. Accordingly, the CoP led a knowledge-to-action initiative that involved a seven-part webinar series meant to transfer step-by-step, skill-based knowledge through live and archived webinars. Although the core planning team functioned effectively to develop the webinars, the CoP was challenged by organizational and long-term care sector cultures, as well as governmental structures within the broader health context. Conclusion: The provincial CoP functioned as an incubator that brought together best practices, research, experiences, a reflective learning cycle, and passionate champions. Nevertheless, the CoP's efforts to stimulate practice changes were met with broader resistance. Research about how to use CoPs to influence health systems change is needed given that CoPs are being tasked with this goal.

%X Learning Objectives: The goal of this report is to share our experience with the use of CACT in hepatic interventions, with the aim to provide practical tips that we have discovered for optimizing image acquisition and postprocessing. Background: With adoption of catheter-based techniques that require technically difficult catheterization, the need for imaging platforms that exploit the advantages of multiple modalities and offer three-dimensional visualization has correspondingly increased. C-arm computed tomography (CACT) is one such modality that is increasingly being used to complement and problemsolve in the angiography suit. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: This presentation includes protocols that minimize radiation exposure and decrease the amount of iodinated contrast injected. We will demonstrate techniques that we use to ensure proper patient and C-arm positioning for procedural efficiency. Patient scenarios and angiographic images will be used to demonstrate situations that would benefit from the problem-solving capability of CACT. Conclusion and/or Teaching Points: This educational exhibit will aid a smooth workflow for physicians, technologists and nursing staff that are transitioning from a DSA only angiography unit to a combined imaging platform capable of 3D imaging. Although our direct experience is limited to the equipment of a single manufacturer, many of the principles and guidelines can be readily extrapolated to other CACT systems.

%X Pain prevalence in hospitalized patients remains high and represents a challenge for nursing practice. In our academic tertiary hospital, we deployed a cross-institutional program for the promotion of good clinical practice for pain management. It offers different tools (pain intranet, pain scales, institutional guidelines, patient brochures, etc.) and several training models. Recently, a distance training (e-learning) of sensitization level about pain was created and deployed to 3500 nurses. Mandatory for these professionals, it aims to establish a common base of knowledge, language and practices. It consists, in its standard course, of 21 short audio-commented presentations. Various additional and optional presentations have been developed for specific services. The model includes an assessment of knowledge before and after, to initially define individual utility of the training and to certify the required knowledge acquisition (rate of 70% success should be obtained to validate the training). The satisfaction of the target audience is also measured by post-training survey. The estimated duration of the course is a half-day of work. The modality of e-learning was chosen because it enables deployment to several thousand people in a relatively short period, an automated assessment, and autonomy and flexibility for the learner who can decide its own learning pace. This article describes the learning system put in place and its evaluation mode.

%X Program/Project Purpose: The population of the Trifinio region in rural southwestern Guatemala experiences high rates of poverty and lack of access to adequate education, healthcare and clean water. The Trifinio Human Development Project includes a clinic and community outreach program and was implemented in 2011 to address these vulnerabilities. Local community health nurses (CHNs), trained by Center for Global Health personnel, deliver the maternal and child programs, which provide education and screening interventions. To better meet the needs of the CHNs and to reduce costs in faculty time and travel, a plan to conduct weekly training sessions via telehealth was actualized in May 2015, with the aim of strengthening the local team's knowledge and capacity. Structure/Method/Design: The curriculum of the 30-minute weekly trainings includes content and guidelines from the World Health Organization, the Breastfeeding Telephone Triage and Advice Book (author MB), the Wellstart International Lactation Self-study Modules and recommendations from the Guatemala Ministry of Health. Trainings are conducted using the Vidyo® technology platform. The initial curriculum focused in breastfeeding and has since included topics requested by participants such as fever, cough and pneumonia, dengue fever and chikungunya, diarrhea, child development and infant rashes. Outcome & Evaluation: Initial evaluation of the telehealth project through participant discussions and assessments shows positive impact on knowledge, confidence and capacity. Customizing the training content to meet the participants' specific needs enhanced acceptance of the remote training. In addition to the educational component, having formalized weekly contact with the CHNs allows for a more effective mechanism for feedback that further strengthens the programs themselves to ultimately improve maternal and child health in the region. Going Forward: Special attention to adult learning techniques such as case-based, interactive teaching to improve engagement and knowledge retention is important for project sustainability. Furthermore, there is a need to determine if certain content is better delivered only in-person versus via telehealth, or via telehealth augmented with in-person training. Revisiting of topics is essential and should be guided by recurring evaluation.

%X Background: mLearning is increasingly presented as an attractive novel educational strategy for medical and nursing education. Yet, evidence base for its effectiveness or factors which influence use, success, implementation or adoption are not clear. We aim to synthesise findings from qualitative studies to provide insight into the factors (barriers and facilitators) influencing adoption, implementation and use of mobile devices for learning in medical and nursing education. The review also aims to identify factors or actions which are considered to optimise the experience and satisfaction of educators and learners in using mobile technologies for medical and nursing education and to identify strategies for improving mLearning interventions for medical and nursing education. Methods: A systematic search will be conducted across a range of databases for studies describing or evaluating the experiences, barriers, facilitators and factors pertaining to the use of mLearning for medical and nursing education. The framework synthesis approach will be used to organise and bring different components of the results together. The confidence in the qualitative review findings will be assessed using the CERQual approach. Discussion: This study will contribute to the planning and design of effective mLearning and the development of mLearning guidelines for medical and nursing education.

%X Introduction: A pilot initiative to train general practitioners (GP) and other health professionals to deliver PA interventions was delivered in 67 GP practices across London. Despite the mounting evidence for the benefits of PA, few health care professionals use PA as an intervention. This may be due to (a) lack of knowledge about the benefits of PA, (b) lack of confidence in delivery of PA, (c) poor access to available opportunities, (d) lack of feedback, and (e) lack of incentives. This initiative was delivered by Intelligent Health Ltd and the National Health Service in London to bridge these barriers and encourage PA uptake as part of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic health legacy. Methods: Between January and August 2012, 311 staff from 67 GP practices received training to prescribe PA to patients with long term conditions which consisted of fourmainareas: (1) Information on how PA can be promoted, (2) Consistency on how to diagnose physical inactivity, (3) Methods to encourage individuals to change their behavior, (4) Methods to signpost individuals to suitable activities. The training sessions lasted for approximately 60 min. An accompanying manual was provided with the latest evidence, contraindications, recommendations and behavior change. Outcome evaluation was focused on process, lessons learned and monitoring against delivery objectives with the aim of examining how the programme could be developed further. All GPs were asked to recall the latest government PA recommendations of 150 min of moderate activity a week. An importance/confidence ruler was used understand the participants' rated level of importance of PA and confidence in delivering PA interventions. Results: Training was delivered to 311 staff from 67 practices across 22 boroughs; with 167 GPs, 70 nurses and health care assistants, 26 people from health promotion and 48 administration staff. Data from 112 participants using the importance / confidence ruler showed statistically significant changes in both in average importance scores of 7.8 and 9.3 before and after training and average confidence ranking of 6.2 and 8.5 before and after training. Not one of the 167 GPs was able to correctly recall the current Government PA recommendations. Discussion: Although GPs are ideal professionals to advocate and prescribe PA, due to lack of knowledge and confidence, this was not being translated into practice. This pilot initiative identified and overcame barriers to prescribing PA and provided a platform for further recommendations to be developed.

%X In integrated delivery networks (IDNs) with complex management structures, shared governance in nursing is a proven model for health care delivery. After Advocate Health Care, the largest IDN in Illinois, implemented shared governance in its nursing, clinical, and non-clinical departments and restructured the organization's technology use, it benefited greatly from a new, shared decision-making process. After listening to business consultants, clinical professionals, and information technology experts, hospitals should take the blended, or comprehensive, approach to new projects. They can succeed by promoting communication supported by an integrated computer platform that helps nursing and business executives reach a consensus. Traditional modes of operation, in which individual administrative, clinical, and technology departments separately introduce innovation, do not deliver an advantage. However, models that incorporate open communication, integration, and knowledge sharing will help large IDNs and other complex health care organizations make the best possible use of their resources and investments.

%X Background Recently, it has been suggested that nurses can perform diagnostic endoscopy procedures, which traditionally have been a physician's responsibility. The existing studies concerning quality of sigmoidoscopy performed by nurses are small, used assessment tools with insufficient validation and to date there is very little knowledge of the learning curve patterns for physicians and nurses. The aim of a present study was to assess early learning curves on a virtual-reality colonoscopy simulator of untrained residents as compared with that of nurses with and without endoscopy assistance experience. Materials and methods Thirty subjects were included in the study: 10 female residents (median age 30.5 years) without colonoscopy experience, 10 female nurses (median age 27.5 years) without endoscopy assistance experience and 10 female nurses (median age 42 years) with endoscopy assistance experience. All participants performed 10 repetitions of task 6 from the "Introduction" colonoscopy module of the Accu Touch Endoscopy simulator. Eight experienced colonoscopists performed three repetitions of task 6 in order to provide the reference expert level of performance. Results All subjects completed the virtual colonoscopy without complications. Significant differences existed between residents and nurses with respect to time to complete the procedure. Residents and nurses showed similar learning curve patterns. There were not significant differences between the groups in terms of volume of insufflated air, percentage of time without discomfort, and percentage of mucosa seen. None of the trainee groups achieved expert proficiency level in terms of time and amount of insufflated air by the tenth repetition. Conclusions Nurses performed virtual colonoscopy as accurately and safely as residents. Although the residents performed significantly faster, time differences showed a tendency towards decreasing, and appraisement of the numeric time differences seemed of minor practical importance. From a technical point of view this indicates that nurses may learn to perform colonoscopy after appropriate training. Copyright © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

%X Objective: To investigate the long term effectiveness of integrated disease management delivered in primary care on quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with usual care. Design: 24 month, multicentre, pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial Setting: 40 general practices in the western part of the Netherlands Participants: Patients with COPD according to GOLD (Global Initiative for COPD) criteria. Exclusion criteria were terminal illness, cognitive impairment, alcohol or drug misuse, and inability to fill in Dutch questionnaires. Practices were included if they were willing to create a multidisciplinary COPD team. Intervention: General practitioners, practice nurses, and specialised physiotherapists in the intervention group received a two day training course on incorporating integrated disease management in practice, including early recognition of exacerbations and self management, smoking cessation, physiotherapeutic reactivation, optimal diagnosis, and drug adherence. Additionally, the course served as a network platform and collaborating healthcare providers designed an individual practice plan to integrate integrated disease management into daily practice. The control group continued usual care (based on international guidelines). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was difference in health status at 12 months, measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ); quality of life, Medical Research Council dyspnoea, exacerbation related outcomes, self management, physical activity, and level of integrated care (PACIC) were also assessed as secondary outcomes. Results: Of a total of 1086 patients from 40 clusters, 20 practices (554 patients) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 20 clusters (532 patients) to the usual care group. No difference was seen between groups in the CCQ at 12 months (mean difference -0.01, 95% confidence interval -0.10 to 0.08; P=0.8). After 12 months, no differences were seen in secondary outcomes between groups, except for the PACIC domain "follow-up/coordination" (indicating improved integration of care) and proportion of physically active patients. Exacerbation rates as well as number of days in hospital did not differ between groups. After 24 months, no differences were seen in outcomes, except for the PACIC follow-up/coordination domain. Conclusion: In this pragmatic study, an integrated disease management approach delivered in primary care showed no additional benefit compared with usual care, except improved level of integrated care and a self reported higher degree of daily activities. The contradictory findings to earlier positive studies could be explained by differences between interventions (provider versus patient targeted), selective reporting of positive trials, or little room for improvement in the already well developed Dutch healthcare system.

%X There is cautious optimism that the economic growth around the Pacific-Rim, will stir opportunities to redress the mental health resource deficiencies and inequity of access to services. Many psychiatric services are without psychiatrists and the primary care doctor or nurse is the key mental health professional. One of the challenges is a paucity of training opportunities and a dearth of trainers. Primary care psychiatry training should be the focus of educational programs. Collaboration in research has been gathering momentum in recent years. The Research in East Asia of Psychotropic Prescription (REAP) includes a consortium of eight countries in Asia. More recently, there have been workshops organized for leadership training of young psychiatrists. The Pacific-Rim College of Psychiatrists and Asia-Pacific Psychiatry journal can be a platform for education and research. The myriad cultures and wide expertise across the Pacific-Rim will make collaboration more exciting and challenging. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

%X Background & Hypothesis: The rise in the ageing population demands an increase in geriatric medicine-trained healthcare providers. Geriatric nursing is not a popular choice. Many cite it as boring, unglamorous, tedious and draining. This negative attitude can affect the older adult's quality of care. We hypothesise that an interprofessional geriatric e-learning module focusing on the essence of geriatric medicine can change attitudes with a resultant career choice in geriatric nursing. Methods: A cohort study of 9 second year nursing students was done. An e-learning module concentrating on multidisciplinary interprofessional collaboration was created. Baseline demographics and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) attitudes scale pre and post e-learning module were collected. Responses as to whether they would consider geriatric nursing upon graduation were collected. Paired t-test compared the change in scores pre and post e-learning module. Statistical significance was taken as P ≤0.05. Results: A total of 77.8% of our cohort was female and 88.9% single. Their pre e-learning UCLA score was 3.35 +/- 0.41 and their post UCLA score was 3.63 +/- 0.46. Unfortunately, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.20). In spite of this improvement in their attitudes towards older adults, 77.8% of them did not intend to go into geriatric nursing giving reasons like indecisiveness and inadequate exposure. Discussion & Conclusion: The e-learning module improved nurisng students' attitudes towards older adults. However, this does not translate into them wanting to do geriatric nursing. Future studies should incorporate the elearning module into their geriatric practicum to study the effect on attitudinal change.

%X Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, with about 1,000,000 people developing the disease each year. The incidence of melanoma has rapidly increased in young white women between the ages of 15-34 over the last three decades. While melanoma accounts for approximately 3% of skin cancers, it causes more than 75% of skin cancer deaths. Thorough skin assessments and awareness of new or changing appearance of skin lesions are critical to early detection and treatment of skin cancer, as well as teaching sun-protective behaviors. Educators created a novel approach to "bring to life" skin cancer assessment skills to promote awareness of prevention and early detection of skin cancer using moulage in a human patient simulation lab. Through the use of moulage-like lesions, simulated patients were evaluated and taught skin cancer prevention and early detection principles by baccalaureate nursing students. The average age of study participants (n = 104) was 26.50 years. The majority of responders were female. At the end of the lab, students' average responses to an evaluation based on program goals were very positive. Anecdotal comments affirmed positive student perceptions of their simulation experience. Data analyses indicated item means were consistently higher for upper-division students. The age and gender of students who participated in this study align with the NCI statistics on age and gender of the population with increased incidence of melanoma.

%X Evidenced-based educational practices propose simulation as a valuable teaching and learning strategy to promote situated cognition and clinical reasoning to teach nursing students how to solve problems. A project that uses a structured debriefing activity, the Outcome Present State-Test Model of clinical reasoning following high fidelity patient simulation, is described in this paper. The results of this project challenge faculty to create and manage patient simulation scenarios that coordinate with didactic content and clinical experiences to direct student learning for the best reinforcement of clinical reasoning outcomes. Considerations for the future include incorporating patient simulation activities as part of student evaluation and curriculum development. The arguments for using high fidelity patient simulation in the current educational environment has obvious short term benefits, however, the long term benefit of developing clinical expertise remains to be discovered.

%X Background: The success of organ and tissue transplantation requires active involvement of society to a great extent. The legislation in our country also emphasises upon “required request” which has two dimensions: (i) it respects individual's right of selfdetermination; (ii) it recognises the role of healthcare providers in organ and tissue procurement. Hence, awareness and education of general public and healthcare professionals is a vital component of deceased donor transplant programme of a hospital. Aim of the study: To highlight the significance of implementation of information; education and sensitisation programmes for the promotion of cadaver organ and tissue donation. Methods: Descriptive approach has been adopted. Activities of a public sector hospital aimed at increasing general awareness and education of different target groups regarding deceased organ and tissue donation are discussed. Results: The institute maintains an active donor registry; has set up round the clock helpline to answer public queries; developed exhaustive website; prepared short documentaries; designed brochures; leaflets; handbills; displayed electronic information boards and hoardings; published a motivational book; organised awareness and pledge camps; lectures; interaction sessions; painting competitions; slogan competitions on organ donation in many government & private organisations. It also conducts orientation; education and training of healthcare professionals such as doctors; nurses; grief counsellors; transplant coordinators; hospital administrators to enhance their knowledge and skills in deceased organ and tissue donation. Conclusions: The hospital initiatives for awareness and education has contributed in spreading the message of organ donation, provided platform to register one's wish for organ donation and facilitated in streamlining the system of brain death declaration and consent for organ & tissue donation at the institute.

%X Social media are changing the ways people communicate and influencing their approaches to meeting their healthcare needs. The Institute of Medicine recommends utilization of information technologies to improve the delivery of patient-centered care. Little is known about how nurses have adopted the use of social media, however. The researchers conducted an online survey to provide a preliminary review of the characteristics of nurses who do and do not use social media. Also, nurses' preferences for using six different types of social media were analyzed and reported. Nurses from 43 states participated in this study, and the sample represented mostly advanced practice nurses who utilized the Internet regularly and confidently. About 94% of the participants indicated that they use social media, whereas fewer than 1% of the participants reported that they do not know how to use social media. Among those who use social media, social networking sites (90.33%) and podcasts (76.24%) were the most popular, followed by social question and asking sites (37.86%), blogs (31.85%), Twitter (19.06%), and SlideShare (9.92%). Social media can be a powerful tool to reach an intended audience quickly and globally. More research is needed to understand how nurses utilize social media to improve the delivery of patient-centered care.

%X Purpose: The Michigan Oncology Medical Home Demonstration Project (MOMHDP) is an innovative multipractice oncology medical home model, supported by payment reform. Sponsored by Priority Health, Physician Resource Management, and ION Solutions, MOMHDP includes four oncology practices and 29 physicians. Methods: Oncology practices used existing technologies, with MOMHDP providing evidence-based treatment guideline selection and compliance tracking, automated physician order entry, a patient portal, symptom management/standardized nurse triage, and advance care planning. To support changes in care and administrative models and to focus on quality, MOMHDP modifies provider payments. The program replaces the average sales price payment methodology with a drug acquisition reimbursement plus a care management fee, calculated to increase total drug reimbursement. Additionally, it reimburses for chemotherapy and treatment planning and advance care planning consultation. There is also a shared savings opportunity. MOMHDP will be enhanced in its second year to include a survivorship program, patient distress screening, imaging guidelines, and standardized patient satisfaction surveys. Priority Health patients receiving chemotherapy for a cancer diagnosis were recruited to the program. Results for this group were compared with a control group of patients from a prior period. Results: In addition to the financial results, the project also accomplished the following: (1) adherence to practice-selected guidelines, (2) institution of advance care planning, (3) effective and standardized symptom management; and (4) payment reform. Conclusion: We have identified a number of critical success factors: strong payer/provider collaboration built on trust through transparent use and cost data; timing of clinical standardization must come from the practices, so they can effectively absorb new approaches; having comprehensive, written program documentation and consistently applied training facilitate practice understanding; existing, off-the-shelf technologies help control costs; independent clinical, administrative, and technical coordination improves provider/payer collaboration; everything takes longer than anticipated, including practice commitment, contracting, and technology implementation. Practices are willing to take on clinical standardization with payment reform. Neither practice size nor technology platform variation was a barrier to participation or success in the project. These results represent preliminary reporting from the first multipractice oncology medical home in the United States, to our knowledge, with payer support that includes payment reform. The results are promising, and the concept warrants further study, review, and reporting. (Table Presented) .

%X Objective: Diabetes prevention and diabetes care improvement in targeted areas and among targeted populations (approximately 62,000 people). Methods: All Project activities were set according to the basic needs of the target groups. The Project team conducted trainings for general practitioners (GPs), regional endocrinologists, nurses (HCPs) and peers. HCPs were trained in diabetes-related issues to use the up-to-date information in their everyday practice. Patient Support Groups were trained to achieve leadership, fundraising, advocacy skills to improve their organizational capacity. Results: In the 4 Target Regions: 1. Nine Diabetes Patient Centers were established, the Centers were provided with basic screening equipment; 2. Education programs, materials and tools for people with diabetes and HCPs were produced; 3. Diabetes Care Quality Metric Tool, Curriculum on Diabetes Prevention for GPs were published; 4. Totally, 2,950 patients and their caregivers were educated; 5. GPs were trained in organization of screening and implementation of preventive measures; 6. Screening was carried out; 7. Patient navigation process related to access to care was improved; 8. Patient Support Groups were formed; 9. Patient resource website was created; 10. Advocacy and media campaigns were conducted; 11. Public awareness on DM prevention and healthy lifestyle was raised. Conclusion: Major lessons learnt: 1. Strengthening of cooperation with local authorities and all stakeholders is essential for the sustainability of the Project; 2. Patient resource web-site can be used only by those who live in big cities, not in the regions. Therefore, developing and distribution of visual/printed materials is important; 3. The Diabetes Map Education Tools are successfully used in the regions; 4. Covering more medical workers rather than train the same HCPs gives better results; 5. Informing medical workers about the State Insurance Program (on diabetes) is essential, as many HCPs have no information about the Program, hence patients suffer from this; 6. To increase the visibility of the Project and its outcomes, mass-communication tools must be widely used. Thus, social media tool and TV-shows were used to inform people about the project. Such Projects help to introduce screening and prevention, to obtain data on diabetes and pre-diabetes prevalence and to improve the quality of diabetes care provided.

%X The aim of the international "MedSkills" Project is to develop a curriculum for teaching and e-learning evidence-based practical skills in medical specialties, focused on the teaching staff and students of medical schools, residents, doctors, nurses and midwives, an ambulance crew, firemen, rescuers, the Red Cross personnel, and others. The promoter of this project is the Free University of Brussels (VUB) (Prof. Marc Nyssen). The partners come from six different European countries: Belgium (VUB; Erasmus Hogeschool; UniWeb BVBA), Greece (University of Athens), Italy (Universita degli Studi di Perugia), Poland (Wroclaw Medical University), Spain (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Servicio de Urgencias y Rescate del Ayuntamiento de Madrid - SAMUR), and the United Kingdom (University of Liverpool). The "MedSkills" Project consists of several modules, devoted to medical fundamentals, respiratory problems, chest pain, shock, minor surgery, burns, and urgent delivery. The Department of Family Medicine of the Wroclaw Medical University has been involved in two modules (medical fundamentals, including basic and advanced life support, wounds and fractures), and has also acted as a coordinator of two others (Minor Surgery, Burns). © Copyright by Wydawnictwo Continuo.

%X There is a need to develop cost effective ways to bring hands-on education about essential information technologies, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems to nursing students, nursing faculty and practitioners. This is especially the case as worldwide there is an increased deployment of these systems and they are transforming the practice of healthcare. However, due to technical, financial and knowledge limitations, many nursing schools and programs do not have an adequate way to bring such technology into their classes and curricula. In this paper we describe an approach to developing Web-based EHR education that allows students from any Web-accessible location to access and work with real EHR systems remotely over the Internet for learning purposes. In this paper we describe our work in moving this approach to a cloud-based solution to allow access to EHRs for educational purposes from any location with Web access and to do so in a way that is both educationally sound and cost effective.

%X BACKGROUND: Prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) is an important responsibility for nurses. Knowledge of the related evidence-based recommendations is necessary to provide high-quality nursing care. AIM: Development of an evaluation tool and subsequent evaluation of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses' knowledge of the SSI prevention guideline to identify their specific educational needs, as part of a needs analysis preceding the development of an e-learning module on infection prevention. METHODS: We developed a multiple-choice knowledge test concerning evidence-based SSI prevention. After expert assessment of its face and content validity, the test was used in a survey among 809 ICU nurses. Demographics included were gender, ICU experience, number of ICU beds, and whether respondents had obtained a specialized ICU qualification. Based on the test results, an item analysis was performed. RESULTS: Face and content validity were achieved for 9 out of 10 items of the questionnaire. From the survey, we collected 650 questionnaires (response rate 80.3%). The item analysis revealed overall good results with values for item difficulty ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 for eight questions, while one question had a value of 0.02; discriminative values ranging from 0.27 to 0.53 and values for the quality of the response alternatives between 0.1 and 0.7. Overall, these results demonstrate the questionnaire's reliability. The nurses' mean score on the knowledge test was 29%. Males were shown to have better scores. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist to improve ICU nurses' knowledge about SSI prevention recommendations. Current guidelines should support their ongoing training and education.

%X As part of a needs analysis preceding the development of an e-learning platform on infection prevention, European intensive care unit (ICU) nurses were subjected to a knowledge test on evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A validated multiple-choice questionnaire was distributed to 22 European countries between October 2006 and March 2007. Demographics included nationality, gender, ICU experience, number of ICU beds and acquisition of a specialised degree in intensive care. We collected 3329 questionnaires (response rate 69.1%). The average score was 45.1%. Fifty-five percent of respondents knew that the oral route is recommended for intubation; 35% knew that ventilator circuits should be changed for each new patient; 38% knew that heat and moisture exchangers were the recommended humidifier type, but only 21% knew that these should be changed once weekly; closed suctioning systems were recommended by 46%, and 18% knew that these must be changed for each new patient only; 51% and 57%, respectively, recognised that subglottic drainage and kinetic beds reduce VAP incidence. Most (85%) knew that semi-recumbent positioning prevents VAP. Professional seniority and number of ICU beds were shown to be independently associated with better test scores. Further research may determine whether low scores are related to a lack of knowledge, deficiencies in training, differences in what is regarded as good practice, and/or a lack of consistent policy. © 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.

%X Background and Purpose: Many authors have reported the effectiveness of telemedicine in healthcare and medical education. There has been limited research addressing its use with nursing education. We sought to examine the impact and effectiveness of education in the Neuro-ICUs of two Comprehensive Stroke Centers. Methods: Guided by a knowledge needs assessment completed by critical care nurses at an academic medical facility in Louisiana, a topic of Intracranial Pressure Crisis in Hemorrhagic Stroke was chosen for an educational course conducted via telepresence. The Neuro-ICU nurses from an academic medical facility in Pennsylvania developed the course content. The course consisted of a 10 questions pre-test, a 30 minute didactic session, an interactive case scenario, and a 10 question post-test. The didactic session reviewed basic neuro pathophysiology and interventions to treat increased intracranial pressure. The interactive case scenario used 3G simulation to allow real time implementation of interventions to treat increased intracranial pressure in the setting of hemorrhagic stroke. The session concluded with a debriefing and post- test. The entire session was completed using telepresence. 15 ICU nurses participated in the course. Participants subsequently completed an anonymous survey. Results of the pre- and post-test were compared via a paired-samples t-test. Results: The mean pre-test score was 7.5/10 (sd 2.378). The mean post-test score was 9.57/10 (sd 1.089). This represents a significant improvement (t=3.64, p= 0.003). All course participants completed the anonymous survey. 89% of participants felt that tele-education was a valuable learning tool. 100% agree that they will change their current bedside practice based on the information provided during the tele-education session. Conclusion: These results demonstrate improved knowledge in the management of elevated intracranial pressure. A tele-presence platform may be an effective means of delivering of educational content to neuro ICU nurses separated by geographic barriers.

%X Learning Objectives: Developing hands-on courses for IR training is a difficult but exciting work. After eight years of experience, we want to share our results. The main objective of this e-poster is to learn about the organization and management of training courses in an animal lab. Background: We mainly conduct courses a day-and-a-half long (three cathlab sessions) with two operating rooms working at the same time, in groups of four with a dedicated professor. Each session is preceded by 45 minutes of theoretical introduction or clinical case discussion in which the students are actively involved. Professors are requested to let the students do all the practical work, guiding them to solve any situation but not interfering with the animal. E-learning introductory courses, virtual simulators, and in vitro testing have also been used, especially in medical representatives' training, to compare different devices. Clinical Findings/Procedure: During these 8 years, we have developed 103 courses in different topics, embolization and leg therapies being the most demanded. In our facilities, we have trained 725 attendees from 34 different countries and specialties. Physicians, nurses, and sales and marketing representatives have attended these sessions. Students' satisfaction was assessed through a quality questionnaire, and achieved an average score of 9.2/10. Conclusion: In IR, there is a wide gap between watching and performing a procedure. Our fellows-in-training can benefit from training on simulators and animal hands-on courses before performing procedures on patients. This is equally important for an experienced operator when learning to use a new complex device.

%X BACKGROUND: The aim of the study presented in this article is to analyse the discriminant factors that have an influence on the use of communities of practice by primary and specialist healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) for information sharing. Obtaining evidence from an ex-ante analysis to determine what factors explain healthcare professionals' clinical community of practice use allows aspects of its use to be identified. METHODS: A theoretical model based on a modified technology acceptance model was used as the analysis tool, and a discriminant analysis was performed. An ad-hoc questionnaire was designed and sent to a study population of 357 professionals from the Badalona-Sant Adrià de Besòs Primary Care Service in Catalonia, Spain, which includes nine primary care centres and three specialist care centres. The study sample was formed by the 166 healthcare professionals who responded. RESULTS: The results revealed three main drivers for engagement in a CoP: First, for the whole sample, perceived usefulness for reducing costs associated with clinical practice was the factor with the greatest discriminant power that distinguished between users and non-users, followed by perceived usefulness for improving clinical practice quality, and lastly habitual social media website and application use. Turning to the two sub-samples of healthcare professions (physicians and nurses, respectively), we saw that the usefulness stemming from community of practice use changed. There were differences in the levels of motivation of healthcare professionals with regards to their engagement with CoP. While perceived usefulness for reducing costs associated with clinical practice was the main factor for the physicians, perceived usefulness of the Web 2.0 platform use for communication for improving clinical practice quality and perceived ease of use were the main factors for the nurses. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of communities of practice, the perception of usefulness of Web 2.0 platform use for communication is determined by organisational, technological and social factors. Specifically, the position that professionals have within the healthcare structure and particularly the closer healthcare professionals' activity is to patients and their professional experience of using social networks and ICTs are crucial to explaining the use of such platforms. Public policies promoting Web 2.0 platform use for communication should therefore go beyond the purely technological dimension and consider other professional and social determinants.

%X Uncontrolled pain is a frequently reported adverse event in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU); nurses' beliefs can contribute to this problem. The aims of this study were to 1) describe PICU nurses' thinking while assessing pain and choosing interventions for children using virtual human (VH) or avatar vignettes, and 2) determine the effect of behavior (smiling, grimacing) and pain type (abdominal surgery, sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis) on nurses' pain ratings and intervention choices among vignettes (virtual, written). Forty nurses responded to four VH vignettes depicting 10-year-old boys with severe pain. After semi-structured interviews, nurses completed the Pain Beliefs and Practices Questionnaire, which included written vignettes matching the VH vignettes. Data analysis included qualitative content analysis, descriptive statistics, and MANOVA. For the qualitative findings, nurses most often described thinking about the child's diagnosis, behavior, pain report, and vital signs when assessing pain and choosing interventions; both diagnoses were described as painful. Quantitatively, nurses rated a child's pain lower than his self-report 58.8% of the time and chose a lesser pain intervention than previously administered 58.2% of the time. Significant multivariate effects were identified for behavior and vignette type. Grimacing children were rated higher for pain (F = 51.05, p < 0.001) and received more morphine (F = 52.85, p < 0.001) than smiling children. Nurses rated pain higher (F = 3.96, p <0.05) and provided more morphine (F = 31.21, p <0.001) to children in the written vignettes. Findings suggest that diagnosis may not influence nurses' choices if perceived as painful. Differences between vignette types may reflect the information delivery (visual or written) or data collection methods. Qualitative and quantitative data substantiated PICU nurses' use of behavior over a child's selfreport to assess and intervene for pain; PICU patients not exhibiting pain behaviors may be at risk for under-treatment.

%X Objective: To review the impact of e-learning on nurses' and nursing student's knowledge, skills and satisfaction related to e-learning. Design: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to assess the impact of e-learning on nurses' and nursing student's knowledge, skills and satisfaction. Electronic databases including MEDLINE (1948-2010), CINAHL (1981-2010), Psychinfo (1967-2010) and Eric (1966-2010) were searched in May 2010 and again in December 2010. All RCT studies evaluating the effectiveness of e-learning and differentiating between traditional learning methods among nurses were included. Data extraction and quality assessment: Data was extracted related to the purpose of the trial, sample, measurements used, index test results and reference standard. An extraction tool developed for Cochrane reviews was used. Methodological quality of eligible trials was assessed. Data synthesis: 11 trials were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Results: We identified 11 randomized controlled trials including a total of 2491 nurses and student nurses'. First, the random effect size for four studies showed some improvement associated with e-learning compared to traditional techniques on knowledge. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.39, MD 0.44, 95% CI -0.57 to 1.46). Second, one study reported a slight impact on e-learning on skills, but the difference was not statistically significant, either (p= 0.13, MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.69). And third, no results on nurses or student nurses' satisfaction could be reported as the statistical data from three possible studies were not available. Conclusion: Overall, there was no statistical difference between groups in e-learning and traditional learning relating to nurses' or student nurses' knowledge, skills and satisfaction. E-learning can, however, offer an alternative method of education. In future, more studies following the CONSORT and QUOROM statements are needed to evaluate the effects of these interventions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

%X BACKGROUND: Continuing education is essential in improving practical psychiatric nursing skills. However, little is known about how knowledge gained in continuing education is transferred to nurses' daily work. OBJECTIVES: To describe the transfer of knowledge gained from an e-learning course to daily practice. DESIGN: Qualitative study design. SETTINGS: One hospital district in Southern Finland with three specialized psychiatric wards (acute, rehabilitation, geriatric wards). PARTICIPANTS: Nursing staff (N=53) were recruited and 35 participated voluntarily in the e-learning continuing education course in spring 2009. METHODS: The data comprised nurses' reflective writing during the e-learning course and course evaluation forms completed after the course. We used qualitative design with inductive content analysis to analyze nurses' writings. RESULTS: The nurses were willing and able to transfer what they learned to their daily practice including the course themes, communication and co-operation among staff members, understanding of preventive and alternative treatment methods and critical thinking regarding one's own work. After the e-learning course the nurses were able to identify development areas such as issues related to staff members' daily work, the patient's role on the ward, alternative methods to avoid coercion, issues pertaining to the care environment on the ward, psychiatric nurses' education, and making an action plan for aggressive situations. All nurses would recommend the course to other nurses. CONCLUSIONS: New knowledge is easily adopted and transferred to daily practice.

%X Nurses play a key role in the provision of health care. Over 70% of the nurses in Kenya are Enrolled Community Health Nurses (ECHNs). AMREF in partnership with Nursing Council of Kenya and the Ministry of Health pioneered an eLearning Nurse Upgrading Programme. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers that hindered enrolment into the programme. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 532 ECHNs was interviewed from four provinces. Data was collected using a pre-tested self administered questionnaire. Analysis was done using SPSS computer software. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables and chi-square tests used to determine variables that were associated with enrolment. Mann Whitney U-test was used for continuous variables. A third (29.7%) of the nurses were from Rift Valley province and 17.9% from Coast. Majority (75%) were from public health facilities. The mean age of the nurses was 40.6 years. The average monthly income was KES 22,497.68 (USD 294). Awareness of the upgrading programme was high (97%) among the nurses. The cost of fees was the main (74.1%) barrier to enrolment in all the provinces and across all the health facilities. The type of health facility was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with enrolment. Nurses from faith-based health facilities were less likely to have enrolled. Awareness of the upgrading programme is high. The cost of upgrading programme, age and working in a faith-based health facility are the main barriers to enrolment. Intervention that fund nurses to upgrade would increase nurse enrolment.

%X Aims: We aim to share the experience gained when establishing a diabetes outreach team (DOT) by describing the structure used and the challenges we faced. Methods: Utilising national diabetes inpatient audit outcomes as well as trust audit data, funding was agreed to improve patient safety by focusing on staff education, patient identification and appropriate diabetes specialist intervention. DOT comprises diabetes specialist nurses, a diabetes specialist dietitian, a diabetes healthcare assistant and dedicated diabetes consultant time. The target patient group are those admitted with a secondary diagnosis of diabetes. DOT delivers daily inpatient ward contact with daily handover and clinical supervision meetings. Weekly operational meetings discuss critical incidents, undertake root cause analysis and review diabetes policies. DOT provides diverse educational opportunities for staff to cater to their various learning needs and time limitations. Quarterly insulin/diabetes safety board meetings are held to review critical incidents, key performance indicators and make recommendations including to the never events committee. Challenges: DOT relies on ward referrals due to having no robust method of identifying patients with diabetes on admission. Other challenges include staff education attendance, accurate data collection, DOT staffing, workload and clear communication amongst the wider multidisciplinary teams. Results: In the first 5 months, 511 staff received education and 163 registered for e-learning. 1,903 patient reviews were undertaken compared with 750 reviews in the same period in 2013. Conclusion: The profile of diabetes within the trust has been raised; however, there have been challenges. Broadly they have been overcome with clear communication involving all levels of the trust to find the best solution.

%X Introduction / objectives: In Hong Kong, the importance of infection prevention and control is recognized indubitably after an outbreak of MRSA with 6 neonatal deaths in 1985. The same year 24 infection control nurses were deployed full-time and formal training course was initiated. In 1989, HKICNA was inaugurated with 44 members and advisers. The followings are the milestones on how HKICNA, developed from a very small establishment, to have significant impacts on healthcare professionals in Hong Kong. Methods: The first 10 years of establishment, infection control awareness continued to grow. Initially the association focused on local meetings to promote and enhance knowledge in infection control. From 1999 HKICNA had ambitions to expand academically to start training course in 1999, publish biannual HKICNA newsletter in 2002. 2003 was a defining moment for infection control in Hong Kong because of the SARS outbreak. Training was in great demand. In 2003-2004, 10 classes with 3212 nurses and doctors trained from local, Macau and China. In that year alone, members grew to 1400 and HKICNA gained enough seed money to organize International Conference as a platform for exchange of scientific information and experience. Since conception in 1989, we have flourished to a reputable academic nursing association in Hong Kong. Now HKICNA is providing the following activities: website, 6-monthly newsletters, Biannual International Conference, annual research grant award, annual conference sponsorships, training course, hand hygiene promotion in the community. Conclusion: Looking back, it is amazing that how a small establishment of a nursing association can instigate such impressive impact professionally.

%X Introduction / Innovation Concept: Emergency medical services (EMS) systems, including aeromedical services, are an important link in the health system chain of survival. When critically ill patients require transport, air ambulances are an important resource to provide specialized and timely care to these patients. In Alberta, the Shock Trauma Air Rescue Service (STARS) provides helicopter air transport to approximately 1,500 patients a year. STARS practitioners have previously used the STARS Medical Control Guidelines, a standard set of textual guidelines developed by Medical Directors, to guide treatment. Recently in partnership with Alberta Health Services EMS, a novel set of algorithms for the critical care patient were developed to guide practitioners. An important challenge was training a clinically diverse (i.e., physician, nurse, paramedic) and geographically dispersed group of practitioners to safely apply the new protocols that contained greater than 130 clinical content and 800 non-clinical changes. Methods: During the development of these protocols, all changes in content from the guidelines to the algorithms were captured in a database by the development group. The education team then developed key objectives for the training, emphasizing the rationale and methods for applying these protocols, and the changes in clinical content that occurred. Online training modules were then developed for practitioners to access. Curriculum, Tool, or Material: Using an online, open-sourced learning platform (Moodle), educators incorporated the changes in practice into online lessons that focused on the objectives that had been outlined. These lessons were broken down into three components: accessing the algorithms, applying the algorithms with patients, and describing clinical content changes. Practitioners were able to navigate these lessons at their leisure using the online platform, and were given 60 days to access and complete the training. Additionally, simulation training and lecture presentations from medical directors (rounds) were available to practitioners monthly with a focus on the same objectives. Conclusion: All practitioners were able to successfully complete the online training within the allotted time. The online learning platform allowed a clinically diverse and geographically dispersed group of practitioners to be successfully trained on the new format and clinical content of the medical protocols.

%X Introduction: TheWorld Health Organization estimates that approximately 132 million women have undergone Female Genital Cutting (FGC). Each Year, 3 million girls are at risk of undergoing this practice. Sexual morbidity, particularly sexual pain is a common complication experienced by women affected by this practice. Given the increasing trends of migration of FGC-affected women to the United Stated, providers are challenged in providing culturally-informed care having very little prior exposure or education on this practice. This study is consistent with the United Nation's 2015 Millennium Development Goal #5: To Improve Maternal Health, and will inform gaps in knowledge and practice for reproductive health providers in the nation. Aim: The aim of this project was to assess whether providers have received FGC awareness training, if that training is being utilized, and how well it is informing the clinical care of women affected by FGC. Methods: A 46-question survey was completed by 500 healthcare providers who are members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP), American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM), and several other clinical practice organizations, to measure knowledge of FGC and the influence it has on obstetric and gynecological practice in the United States. The survey was conducted electronically using the SurveyMonkey® platform. Main Outcome Measures: Awareness and/or clinical training regarding FGC; the importance of knowledge of FGC in clinical practice; and the need for specific education about FGC and its impact on clinical practice. Results and Conclusions: Most providers could not correctly identify the different types of FGC, yet the majority of respondents (60%) had previously provided care to a patient who had undergone FGC. The most commonly reported complication for patients who had undergone FGC was pain during sexual intercourse. Most respondents (78%) reported a desire for additional education on FGC, as well as how to handle it in the context of their OB/GYN practice. Approximately one-fifth of respondents stated they were eager to learn of the study results, as they felt FGC was an important topic that was not adequately addressed, if at all, in today's clinical OB/GYN practice.

%X The current status of interprofessional education (IPE) in Australian and New Zealand universities is largely unexamined despite its generally acknowledged benefit. Data are also limited about the use of IPE in teaching medication safety to nursing, pharmacy and medical students. For this reason a web-based cross-sectional survey was used to gather information from Australian and New Zealand universities offering nursing, pharmacy or medical programs. Responses were received from 31 of the 43 (72%) target universities. Eighty percent of the participants indicated that they currently offer IPE experiences, but only 24% of these experiences met the accepted definition of IPE. Of the participants who offer IPE as defined by Center for the Advancement of Interprofessional Education, only 50% use it to teach medication safety. Timetabling restrictions and lack of appropriate teaching and learning resources were identified as the main barriers to implementation of IPE. All participants reported that staff development, multi-media and e-learning resources would be beneficial to IPE initiatives and the teaching of medication safety. Innovative approaches will be needed to overcome the barriers and facilitate the uptake of quality IPE more broadly. Web-based and e-learning options promise a possible way forward, particularly in the teaching of medication safety to nursing, pharmacy and medical students.

%X The Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS) is a Shire-sponsored, global, longitudinal, observational registry that collects information on the natural history of Hunter syndrome and long-term effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase. Established in 2005, HOS includes numerous fields covering many different clinical and biochemical assessments. As of March 2013, the registry contained information from more than 900 patients. The Hunter Outcome Survey moving towards system enhancement (HOSMOSE) project was initiated in July 2012 to enhance the data entry process and focus the database towards clinically important variables. Specific goals of this project included: substantially decreasing the number of data fields in consultation with HOS investigators and study nurses to ensure collection of the most clinically and scientifically relevant data; updating and improving the HOS platform and user interface to better reflect routine clinical practice, facilitate efficient data entry, optimize the future value of all the information already captured and minimize the addition of new fields; updating data fields and drop-down lists; increasing data quality through the inclusion of more automatic edit checks and guideline text; and facilitating remote monitoring by improving query functionality. Migration of data to the updated platform is being carefully planned and executed, and will be properly documented and validated. Two rounds of user acceptance testing will be performed at appropriate intervals. Finally, extensive quality assessments of the completed system will be performed. Internal and site training before launch of the new system will be crucial to its success.

%X Objective / Background Often unrecognized and untreated, perinatal mental health problems can have significant long-term negative consequences for women, their babies, and their families. Although nurses have an important role in the identification and treatment of perinatal mental health problems, undergraduate nursing curricula have a limited focus on these disorders and their treatments. Objective: Increase nursing students' understanding of women's experience of living with perinatal mental health problems. Methods This study employed photovoice, a participatory action research method guided by tenets of health promotion, education for critical consciousness, feminist theory, and documentary photography. Following Wang and Burris, a convenience sample of 7 women created photographs and wrote about their experience of living with perinatal mental health problems. The group met regularly to share photographs and narratives and identify common themes in their experience. Results Through consensus participants selected photographs and accompanying narratives to create an e-learning resource (https://vimeo. com/60458330). Themes included unmet expectations; loss of identity; altered physical, emotional and cognitive well-being; disrupted relationships; the breaking point; difficulty asking for help; and reflections on healing. Conclusion / Discussion Educating nursing students about perinatal mood problems increases their mental health literacy and helps prepare them to take up a critical role in the early recognition and compassionate care of women with perinatal mental health problems.

%X What started in Berlin in May of 2000 as an idea to create the telemedicine program of Kosova in order to help the country rebuild the broken medical system and change the miserable face of medicine, has now spread to other countries in the Balkans. Today, June 29, 2007, as I am rewriting this chapter, ten doctors and engineers from Kosova, Montenegro and Macedonia graduated from a three weeks intensive course on telemedicine, e-health and medical electronic library. This international telemedicine fellowship is organized by the very entity that was created in Berlin 7 years ago: The International Virtual e-Hospital (IVEH). This time, however they are part of a project called "Improving Health Care in the Balkans Using Telemedicine, Advanced Technologies and Cultural Exchange Programs as a Platform" funded by the Bureau of Education and Cultural Exchange of the State department of USA, and is being implemented in collaboration with Arizona Telemedicine Program and University of Arizona Health Science Center Library, as well as Alaska Telemedicine program in Anchorage. The goal of the program is to create the medical and technical leadership that will significantly enhance health care access and quality in the region. This program is creating a powerful international medical education network in the Balkans for further collaboration and development. As part of the project, 48 physicians, nurses and engineers from Kosova, Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania are being trained in telemedicine, e-health, electronic library management, trauma and surgical critical care. A group of experts in these same medical disciplines will conduct workshops, seminars and other cultural and educational activities in the Balkan region. We can say now with certainty that the Telemedicine Program of Kosova is having an impact in the region that goes far beyond telemedicine applications and advanced technologies in the Balkans. It is creating leadership that will take the future in their own hands, as they become the true champions of telemedicine and rebuilding the dream of advancing the health care in their own countries. As we say at IVEH, it is "one country at a time." In October, we will inaugurate the Second Phase of the Telemedicine Program of Kosova. On October 21-23, in Tirana, Albania, we will organize the Second Intensive Balkan Telemedicine and e-health seminar, a three-day workshop on current principles and practices of telemedicine, e-health, and medical informatics. The journey that started in Berlin is continuing. Soon we will be traveling to Atalaya, Peru and other communities of Amazon River, then Africa. We will not stop. One country at a time!

%X Web 2.0 provides a platform or a set of tools such as blogs, wikis, really simple syndication (RSS), podcasts, tags, social bookmarks, and social networking software for knowledge sharing, learning, social interaction, and the production of collective intelligence in a virtual environment. Web 2.0 is also becoming increasingly popular in e-learning and e-social communities. The objectives were to investigate how Web 2.0 tools can be applied for knowledge sharing, learning, social interaction, and the production of collective intelligence in the nursing domain and to investigate what behavioral perceptions are involved in the adoption of Web 2.0 tools by nurses. The decomposed technology acceptance model was applied to construct the research model on which the hypotheses were based. A questionnaire was developed based on the model and data from nurses (n = 388) were collected from late January 2009 until April 30, 2009. Pearson's correlation analysis and t tests were used for data analysis. Intention toward using Web 2.0 tools was positively correlated with usage behavior (r = .60, P < .05). Behavioral intention was positively correlated with attitude (r = .72, P < .05), perceived behavioral control (r = .58, P < .05), and subjective norm (r = .45, P < .05). In their decomposed constructs, perceived usefulness (r = .7, P < .05), relative advantage (r = .64, P < .05), and compatibility (r = .60,P < .05) were positively correlated with attitude, but perceived ease of use was not significantly correlated (r = .004, P < .05) with it. Peer (r = .47, P < .05), senior management (r = .24,P < .05), and hospital (r = .45, P < .05) influences had positive correlations with subjective norm. Resource (r = .41,P < .05) and technological (r = .69,P < .05) conditions were positively correlated with perceived behavioral control. The identified behavioral perceptions may further health policy makers' understanding of nurses' concerns regarding and barriers to the adoption of Web 2.0 tools and enable them to better plan the strategy of implementation of Web 2.0 tools for knowledge sharing, learning, social interaction, and the production of collective intelligence.

%X In order to enhance the training opportunities available in the UK in the field of Neuromuscular Disease, we have designed a new Masters programme that will be run at UCL Institute of Neurology. This Masters programme aims to equip a wide range of professionals, from clinicians through PAMS and basic scientists with the fundamental principles, biology and latest research and technical advances in the field of neuromuscular disease. The programme builds on the extensive educational expertise present at the UCL Institute of Neurology. The Course aims to train a wide range of specialists, from basic scientists to clinicians, as well as professionals allied to medicine, including nurses and physiotherapists. The Course will take the form of taught lectures and tutorials as well as practicals, workshops and Master Classes. In addition, each student will be expected to undertake a research project under the supervision of world class, leading clinical experts and basic scientists in the field of neuromuscular disease. The Course has been developed following research into the educational requirements of both professional organizations and professionals themselves. We undertook a survey using the UCL Opinio Survey Platform, which was circulated via the MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases. We received an excellent response, which was used in the course design. The Course shares some modules with other existing programmes within UCL, including the Institute of Child Health, with plans for collaboration with the Neuromuscular Team in Newcastle.

%X Glaucoma is a multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by an acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells at levels beyond normal age-related loss and corresponding atrophy of the optic nerve. Although many treatments are available to manage glaucoma, glaucoma is a chronic condition. Some patients may seek complementary or alternative medicine approaches such as acupuncture to supplement their regular treatment. The underlying plausibility of acupuncture is that disorders related to the flow of Chi (the traditional Chinese concept translated as vital force or energy) can be prevented or treated by stimulating relevant points on the body surface. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with glaucoma. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2013), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (January 1937 to January 2013), ZETOC (January 1993 to January 2013), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to January 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine web site (NCCAM) (http://nccam.nih.gov). We did not use any language or date restrictions in the search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 January 2013 with the exception of NCCAM which was last searched on 14 July 2010. We also handsearched Chinese medical journals at Peking Union Medical College Library in April 2007.We searched the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS), and the Chinese Biological Database (CBM) for the original review; we did not search these databases for the 2013 review update. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one arm of the study involved acupuncture treatment. Two authors independently evaluated the search results and then full text articles against the eligibility criteria. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We included one completed and one ongoing trial, and recorded seven trials awaiting assessment for eligibility. These seven trials were written in Chinese and were identified from a systematic review on the same topic published in a Chinese journal. The completed trial compared auricular acupressure-a nonstandard acupuncture technique-with the sham procedure for glaucoma. This trial is rated at high risk of bias for masking of outcome assessors, unclear risk of bias for selective outcome reporting, and low risk of bias for other domains. The difference in intraocular pressure (measured in mm Hg) in the acupressure group was significantly less than that in the sham group at four weeks (-3.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.11 to -0.29 for the right eye; -4.90, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.72 for the left eye), but was not statistically different at any other follow-up time points, including the longest follow-up time at eight weeks. No statistically significant difference in visual acuity was noted at any follow-up time points. The ongoing trial was registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization. To date this trial has not recruited any participants. At this time, it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from available data to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of glaucoma. Because of ethical considerations, RCTs comparing acupuncture alone with standard glaucoma treatment or placebo are unlikel to be justified in countries where the standard of care has already been established. Because most glaucoma patients currently cared for by ophthalmologists do not use nontraditional therapy, clinical practice decisions will have to be based on physician judgments and patient preferences, given this lack of data in the literature. Inclusion of the seven Chinese trials in future updates of this review may change our conclusions.

%X Despite Nova Scotia having the second highest prevalence of Type 2 DM and Obesity in Canada, funding to support more than 1800 patients on a wait list for weight loss surgery at any given time falls short. The Capital Health Weight Loss Surgery team which consists of one surgeon, one endocrinologist, one nurse practitioner (part time 0.7 FTE), one dieititan (part time 0.3 FTE), one psychologist (part time 0.1 FTE), one physiotherapist (part time 0.1 FTE) and 1 booking clerk (0.1 FTE) has worked to create an informative website to assist patients to prepare for weight loss surgery. They have also supported post surgery weight loss surgery patients to create a Facebook support group for pre and post surgery patients at Capital Health. Supportive information is posted on the CDHA Obesity Network pertaining to the qualifications for surgery, the surgical procedure, preparing for surgery and post surgery expectations. It also incorporates useful tips and education on making lifestyle changes mostly related to physical activity and nutrition. Patients are directed to go to this website, print off the information, assemble it in a binder and study it prior to meeting the team at the first clinic titled “What Is Weight Loss Surgery”. Among this information is a pre clinic quiz and in-depth health assessment to complete. The aim is to assist in gaining insight and knowledge regarding program information discussed at this first clinic meeting, to fully consider their health and reflect on their personal decision and goals in making lifestyle changes and pursuing surgery. This also encourages patients to have an opportunity to communicate and obtain support from their practitioners and other healthcare professionals in their community prior to their one-on-one meeting with the weight loss surgery team. Patients communicate feeling prepared for what to expect and recognize the website as a key tool to enhance knowledge with team supported documents/articles. Healthcare professionals can refer to the website for information on the referral process and surgical qualifications, as well as, gain knowledge of the weight loss surgery program in order to best support their patients. The FaceBook group is run by team selected leaders of patients who have progressed well in weight loss surgery. The group is specific to Capital Health patients such that to be involved in the group participants must be Capital Health Weight Loss Surgery Patients. Patients communicate appreciating this peer-to-peer support network at all stages of their weight loss surgery journey. This poster will focus on the Capital Health website components/ information supplied and communication process/connection to the FaceBook support group. We feel it is a cost effective, efficient means of assisting patients to access key knowledge and support while empowering them to be active in accessing information and connections to support them in their weight loss surgery journey.

%X Objectives The primary aim of this article was to identify the latent failures that are perceived to underpin medication errors. Study Setting The study was conducted within three medical wards in a hospital in the United Kingdom. Study Design The study employed a cross-sectional qualitative design. Data Collection Methods Interviews were conducted with 12 nurses and eight managers. Interviews were transcribed and subject to thematic content analysis. A two-step inter-rater comparison tested the reliability of the themes. Principal Findings Ten latent failures were identified based on the analysis of the interviews. These were ward climate, local working environment, workload, human resources, team communication, routine procedures, bed management, written policies and procedures, supervision and leadership, and training. The discussion focuses on ward climate, the most prevalent theme, which is conceptualized here as interacting with failures in the nine other organizational structures and processes. Conclusions This study is the first of its kind to identify the latent failures perceived to underpin medication errors in a systematic way. The findings can be used as a platform for researchers to test the impact of organization-level patient safety interventions and to design proactive error management tools and incident reporting systems in hospitals. © Health Research and Educational Trust.

%X Information technology in the nursing profession has been in existence for years, but only now with the growing presence of the Internet is it viewed as a possible platform to help meet the need for nurses' continuing educational development. For this to happen, it is important to know qualified nurses' experience with the Internet. In the United Kingdom, there is little understanding of whether community nurses have experience in using the Internet and if they do, how they use it. This article reports the findings of a survey questionnaire, taken in 1998, that was designed to target a random sample of 100 community nurses in Aberdeen, Scotland, to gauge awareness and attitudes toward the use of electronic sources of information for continuing education purposes. The response rate for the questionnaire was 83% (n = 83). A series of workshops was also undertaken, exploring the potential of the Internet and its access. A total of 52 people attended the workshops. One of the main aims of the workshops was to demystify the image of the computer, breaking down barriers for those with little or no experience in this field. The major findings of the survey and workshops indicate that although many respondents were interested in the potential benefits of the Internet to access information, there was little use made of and limited access to computer equipment.

%X Aim: To develop and evaluate an online educational package instructing paediatricians and trainees in the diagnosis and management of a first unprovoked seizure in children. Methods: The E-learning content was created following a comprehensive literature review that referenced current international guidelines. Rigorous consultation with local paediatric neurologists, paediatricians and epilepsy nurses was undertaken. A series of learning modules was created and sequenced to reflect steps needed to achieve optimal diagnosis and management in a real-life situation of a child presenting with a paroxysmal event. Paediatric registrars and advanced trainees from the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network were assessed before and after using the E-learning Resource. Measures included general epilepsy knowledge, case-based scenario knowledge; self-rated measures of satisfaction with instruction and confidence regarding clinical approach to the child with first unprovoked seizure; and open ended questions evaluating the usefulness of the E-learning resource. Results: Performance on measures of general epilepsy knowledge and on the seizure-related case scenarios improved significantly following completion of the E-learning as did self-rated satisfaction with instruction and confidence across all aspects of managing first seizure. Conclusions: The E-learning resource has been validated as a useful educational resource regarding the first afebrile unprovoked seizure for paediatricians.

%X Introduction: Historically, EMS students participated in a 1-day clinical rotation at a large metropolitan burn center to observe wound care and rounds, shadow charge RNs and complete self-learning burn care e-modules as part of the required paramedic student education. As a result, student and staff experiences varied widely. To provide a more uniform, comprehensive experience, this center transformed the rotation to into a burn specialty course. It was hypothesized that a more consistent, interactive format would positively impact staff and students' experiences. The following outlines the experience to establish a best practice in the education of the prehospital providers critical to the positive outcomes for burn injured patients. Methods: As of 7/12, 12 cohorts of 8-12 students/ providers completed the reformatted 7-hour course presented by 1 of 2 nurse clinicians. Components include a unit tour, wound care observation, presentations on unique aspects of multidisciplinary care by area specific providers, an interactive lecture focused on the impact of EMS on the care continuum, and visit to the hyperbaric chamber. At conclusion, attendees completed a 25-question, core content exam and an anonymous 10 question survey about the experience. At 14 months post implementation, 25 charge RNs were surveyed about the redesigned format. Results: Between 7/12-8/13, 118 students completed the rotation; 116 (94%) completed the exam (mean 94 ± 7 (72- 100)) and 111 (94%) completed the survey. Most (strongly) agreed the lecture length to be appropriate (94%) and observing wound care improved understanding of burn care (88%). Most affirmed the lecture (96%) and tour (96%) increased insight into the role of EMS in the care continuum; 96% felt the rotation improved knowledge of emergency care of the burn injured patient. Free text reported wound care observation and course organization/format as very positive while more wound care observation and patient interaction were suggested improvements. Ten charge RNs (40%) responded, and reported that 60% support the new format; 80% believe that it provides a more consistent educational experience ; 60% and 86% agree wound care observation supports EMS education and that the students are responsive to the wound care teaching. Conclusions: The new format resulted in positive educational and clinical experience for EMS providers and staff and corroborates evidence of EMS student preference for an educational style focused on the clinical experience. Based on these findings, our center will build on this platform to further improve this burn specialty course. Other EMS training programs may benefit by instituting a similar format for burn training.

%X Background: In order to deliver safe and effective patient care in the operating room, staff must work together as a team. Teamwork requires closed-loop communication and the ability to anticipate events. Studies have shown that interdisciplinary simulation exercises improve the efficiency with which health care providers and other ancillary staff respond to highacuity situations. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that multimedia resources help learners recall and retain information. 360-degree video is an emerging multimedia platform, which allows users to be visually immersed in a video. Using this technology and these premises we are working with the OR nursing staff to create high-fidelity simulations and recording them in 360-degrees. Methods: Quarterly group simulations were held with members of the nursing staff, surgical team, and anesthesia team. Participants were notified in advance that a simulation exercise was planned but details of the scenario were not disclosed. To date we have done a pediatric surgery scenario and a pediatric post-anesthesia care scenario in 360-degree video. To create a realistic experience the perioperative environment was set-up in the normal fashion using standard equipment and a mannequin patient. A 360-degree, six GoPro camera mount was positioned in the center of the room to record the simulation. Individual videos were then downloaded to a VR-capable, custom build PC and stitched together using Autopano Video Pro. The final video was uploaded to Youtube, allowing anyone with a mobile phone or computer to view it in 360-degrees. Results: Rendering 360-degree videos from six GoPro cameras was successful with good resolution and sound. The video could be viewed from a computer, mobile device, or virtual reality headsets. Initial reception of the 360-degree recordings of the simulation was positive. OR staff who viewed the videos stated that the ability to view everything occurring simultaneously allowed them to better understand the overall scenario. Learners commented that it enabled them to discern their own individual roles within the group as well as the ongoing interplay between different services. Conclusion: 360-degree videos provide distinct advantages over traditional videos when used for interdisciplinary simulation because it provides the participant a vantage point otherwise unobtainable. Being able to view the entire room through one video stream allows an individual from any service or even hospital administration to review safety protocols in place and ascertain if there are deficiencies in training or resources needed to respond appropriately to high-acuity situations. Additional work is required to ascertain the optimal positioning of the camera as well as improving the stitching and processing of the video.

%X Background: In Australia, 81% of the psychiatric workforce services 66% of the population, while 19% services the remaining 34%, those who live in rural and remote Australia. This serves as a platform for understanding the access barrier to sub-specialty psychiatric services for those who live outside metropolitan centres. Whilst telehealth psychiatry services, nurse practitioners and general practitioners with advanced skills training have been effective in closing this gap, they cannot fully replace the value of face-to-face specialist consultations. Objectives: To stimulate discussion about strategies for enhancing sub-specialty knowledge, skills and practice in clinicians who work in rural and remote settings. Methods: The development of a mental health service across several rural and remote communities within Townsville Hospital and Health Service district will be considered, including needs for service, identified service gaps and strategies to address these, including development of generalist and sub-specialty skills among psychiatrists and other clinicians. Issues encountered thus far will be discussed, including clinical governance and oversight, impact of service structure changes, training needs and formal and informal training opportunities. Findings and conclusions: To acquire a better understanding of the need for a training model to be developed for psychiatrists who work in rural and remote settings to have a generalist focus, necessitating enhanced subspecialty knowledge and skills, and to propose a potential training model to meet this need.

%X Aim: This paper details the experience of establishing an integrated skills training centre for use in undergraduate nursing education in The Open University of Hong Kong. Background: Skills training is an essential element in undergraduate nursing education. Owing to the increasing complexity of the health-care system and patient health needs, undergraduate nursing students should be well prepared for integrated skills competency, critical thinking and rapid decision-making. To achieve this goal, the use of simulation as a skills training tool is being recommended. Conclusion: The Clinical Nursing Education Centre is established. It adopts simulation as a teaching and learning tool. It has four specific education units, namely: (1) clinical simulation education unit, (2) virtual reality education unit, (3) nursing skills education unit, and (4) Chinese medicinal education unit. These units are specifically designed for the teaching and learning of nursing skills related to general, mental and Chinese medicinal nursing from elementary to advanced level. Experiences pertaining to the conceptualization, exploration and actualization phases of the establishment are presented. Details of the structure and specific functions of the centre are also illustrated. Finally, there is discussion on the challenges encountered during the establishment process and how they were overcome. © 2010 The Authors.

%X Introduction Social media use in medical education is expanding rapidly, bringing with it a novel means of learner engagement, feedback, collaboration and professional development.1 A growing body of respiratory specialists and trainees are now engaging in such activities via Twitter.2 We describe one of the commonest dedicated Respiratory 'Hashtags' (“#RespEd”) where content related to evidence-based medicine (EBM), e-learning and collaboration is curated. Methods “#RespEd” tweets were reviewed for usage statistics since 01/01/2013 using www. Symplur.com with more detailed review of monthly analytics since 01/04/2014. All “#RespEd” tweets were downloaded from Twitter and Symplur. Transcripts were reviewed for content using Microsoft Excel. A review of related hastags identified through Symplur was conducted to assess reach across Respiratory hashtags in a similar timeframe. Results The “#RespEd hashtag” was first used in January 2013. Since this time, Symplur identified 1,099 participants and 5,973 tweets. Audience 'reach' was recorded as 7,384,722 impressions. A steady increase in users has evolved in the last 18 months with clear peaks in activity around the BTS Summer and Winter meetings. Participants included a wide range of professionals including doctors, nursing staff, pharmacists, physiotherapists, patients and representatives of societies and mainstream respiratory journals. Users were from numerous countries. Common content included evidence-based medicine (e.g. recently published articles), e-learning resources and 'live-tweets' from training days, which were usually picture tweets of lecturers slides. Other established respiratory hashtags included (participants): #ATS2015 (2,812), #ERS2014 (2,179), #Pulmcc (1,927), #BTSWinter (487). Conclusions Twitter represents an untapped respiratory educational resource, which is truly multi-disciplinary and breaks boundaries between professional groups. The BTS conferences have provided a clear platform to broaden this resource. There is an opportunity to reach out to trainees and others seeking continuing professional development and provide both reliable resources and a 'place' to foster debate and discourse on topical respiratory themes.

%X Purpose: This study evaluated the post-implementation impact of a nursing information system and identified issues related to the technology adoption process. Given the high level of investment necessary to implement information systems, evaluation has become vital to ensure successful adoption and use. Improved understanding of implementation difficulties/barriers and factors leading to them can serve as a platform for the development of strategies and education programs for users. Method: The study design was a two-stage data comparison analysis of a nursing information system focusing on computerized nursing care plan use. Data were collected from nurses by questionnaire during the first month (December 2004) and 1 year after system installation (December 2005). Results: While nurses gave the information technology a higher evaluation score at the second stage than at the early stage, the overall ratings were slightly negative at both stages. Age and pressure to use the system were critical factors at both stages, whereas computer skills and perceived time using the system were vital at the beginning stage of implementation. Issues of concern at both stages were system functionality, efficiency, usability, and user support. Conclusion: Implementation of an information system requires consideration of issues involving hardware and software, staff training, organizational policy, and workflow changes. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X Background: Safe medication management is a major competency taught in the nursing curriculum. However, administering pediatric medications is considered a common clinical stressor for Taiwanese students. A supplemental e-learning program that helps students fill the gap between basic nursing skills and pediatric knowledge on medication safety was developed. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an e-learning program to increase pediatric medication management among students who take pediatric nursing courses. Design: This intervention study used a historical comparison design. Setting: A university in Northern Taiwan. Participants: A total of 349 undergraduate nursing students who took pediatric nursing courses participated. Eighty students in the comparison group received regular pediatric courses, including the lectures and clinical practicum; 269 students in the intervention group received an e-learning program, in addition to the standard pediatric courses. Methods: Between February 2011 and July 2012 pediatric medication management, including pediatric medication knowledge and calculation ability, was measured at the beginning of the first class, at the completion of the lectures, and at the completion of the clinical practicum. The program was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: The intervention group had significantly higher pediatric medication management scores at completion of the lecture course and at the completion of the clinical practicum than the comparison group based on the first day of the lecture course, after adjusting for age, nursing program, and having graduated from a junior college in nursing. Overall, the students appreciated the program that included various teaching modalities content that related to the administration of medication. Conclusion: Using an e-learning program on pediatric medication management is an effective learning method in addition to sitting in a regular lecture course. The different emphases in each module, provided by experienced instructors, enabled the students to be more aware of their role in pediatric medication safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Objective: To measure the pragmatic real-life outcome of Personalised Care Programme (PCP) for patients with severe mental illnesses (SMI) residing at Kwai Tsing district. Methods: There are overseas and local evidence to support the effectiveness of case management model, in terms of administrative, clinical, psychosocial outcome and client / carer satisfaction. District-based PCP modelled on overseas community mental health team and case management models. It started in April 2010 at Kwai Tsing district. A total of 1515 SMI patients would be recruited and cared by 33 trained case managers (CM) of different disciplines. The programme objectives were: patient-centred care, needs and risk management, gate-keeping to prevent avoidable hospitalisation, better treatment adherence and reduction of disabilities, enhancement of recovery, and social inclusion. Case managers comprised staff mix of psychiatric nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists. Risk stratification of patients with SMI was done and selected patients were assigned CM. Holistic risks and needs assessments were performed by CM with validated instruments, and they adopted care programme approach to provide proactive, multi-disciplinary, continuous, coordinated, accessible, accountable and individualised biopsychosocial care plan to patients with SMI, to reduce risks, needs and disabilities and increase strengths of patients with Hybrid Model of Clinical Case Management Model and Strengths Model. They involved internal and community partners for collaborated services at regular clinical meetings and service co-location in the district platform to strengthen pre-discharge risks-needs assessment and post-discharge community support to enhance recovery and social inclusion of patients in the community. Case managers followed up patients for at least 1 year to deliver phase-specific interventions through collaboration with patients and carers under shared care concept along their recovery journey. Extended CM service hours covering 365 days within the year, continuity of care and crisis intervention to individual patient along the care pathway by the same CM were provided to enhance seamless quality safe care. Medical supervision and non-ojfice hour medical support were provided to CM. Central training programme and clinical protocols were provided for CM to acquire generic core competency. District-based community mental health service collaboration, co-location at the community centres, and expertise sharing with community partners to deliver accessible, timely, non-stigmatising, on-site cost-effective collaborative care were implemented. It provided an exit strategy for HA services to community partner services, empowered their gate-keeper role, and facilitated the mobilisation of community resources to enhance the sustainable community living of our clients. It provided one-stop solution to service users and carers. Estate-based case management system was developed to provide one-entry point for collaboration with community partners with clear accountability and better cost-effectiveness. Comparisons in outcome domains, including readmission rate, unplanned readmission rate, outpatient default rate, quality of life, accident and emergency department attendance rate, clinical symptom, social and occupational functioning, daytime engagement, and patient satisfaction survey and carer distress, were performed with validated instruments before and after admission to PCP with intention-to-treat analysis. Results and Conclusions: District-based PCP service model may be a viable option in Hong Kong to revolutionise future service model to enhance the recovery and social inclusion of patients with SMI in the community.

%X Background and Objective: Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) allows to optimize therapeutic pain management. However, the use of an infusion pump for PCA is complex and ignorance of this device can limit its use. Concern has been raised about the high incidence of critical incidents related to these devices. The objective of this regional work, intended for doctors and nurses, hospital workers or liberals, is to promote the good use of PCA. Setting and Method: An expert workgroup, composed of doctors, pharmacists and nurses, worked on a regional guidelines for PCA use, made of recommendations and practical tools. Results: Five issues are mentioned in the regional guidelines: prescription, preparation, administration, infusion assembly, patient's and infusion's supervision, and patient information. For each issue, several help tools are associated to the recommendations. Templates of prescriptions (for narcotics, medical equipment or nursing act), an opioids equivalence chart, a table of the main molecules used in PCA (specifying the various dosages), the pharmacy or hospital pharmacy's supply arrangements and product stability in pump for PCA are proposed. A template of treatment supervision form allows to confront the prescription parameters with the efficiency and tolerance evaluation of treatment. A practical tool is proposed to help nurses in calculating doses, concentration, infusion rates and choosing the best opioids presentation. The nursing practice of having a second person repeat the calculation should be adopted. A sketch of the device reminds the importance of antireflux valve which should be inserted in any other line that is connected to the PCA, in order to prevent back-flow up. A protocol of opioids overdose management is also proposed, as well as an information sheet intended to patients, mentioning the steps to follow in case of adverse event or in case of unrelieved pain. Conclusions: To complete these guidelines, an evaluation of professional practices was proposed to make all healthcare professionals aware of these issues and help them in the improvement of their practices. An internet-base training (e-learning) on PCA is being developed to promote the training of healthcare professionals.

%X Background: There is significant variation in colonoscopy, both in technical quality (adenoma detection) and clinical care (recommended colonoscopy intervals). Prior efforts to evaluate causes of variation have been limited by low physician response rates, often <30%, introducing response bias. Our aim was to explore novel methods of survey delivery to improve response rates and generate more robust data. Methods: We conducted interviews with gastroenterologists, endoscopy nurse managers, survey experts and health policy specialists regarding known and perceived barriers to survey completion and potential solutions. A number of techniques for engaging physicians were identified: 1) Inclusion of a limited number of representative sites 2) Engagement with credible physician champions at sites 3) Engagement of endoscopy unit nurse managers 4) Use of both paper and online surveys 5) Use of brief surveys with clearly stated completion time 6) Direct (face to face when possible) engagement with physicians regarding the value of the effort and 7) Peer and email follow-up with nonresponders. Utilizing these techniques we administered a novel colonoscopy quality-focused survey evaluating physicians' fund of knowledge, technical skill, and conscientiousness. Four study sites were chosen based on varied geography (east, west and central US), financial incentives, practice type size and procedure volume. All physicians performing ≥30 colonoscopies in the prior two years were included. Results: Across the 4 sites, 118 (84.3%) of 140 physicians completed the surveys. Completion rate across the 4 sites ranges from 80-100%. See Table 1 for respondent characteristics. At two sites comprised of 11 individual endoscopy units, endoscopy nurse managers played a central role. The nurses were given a small honorarium and provided with paper surveys and online survey links and told that if 80% completion was achieved, we would pay for a lunch for the endoscopy unit staff. At these sites, paper surveys were distributed by nurses during breaks in endoscopy. At one site physician champions engaged colleagues and surveys were completed online. At the fourth site a webinar on colonoscopy quality metrics and the goal of the survey was given during a faculty meeting with surveys provided after the meeting. While there was variation in completion rate between sites, all sites reached our a priori goal of 80% completion.(Table 1) Examples of data collected are shown in table 2. Conclusions: In contrast to studies that have queried a large number of physicians with low response rates, by targeting a limited number of sites and using site-tailored engagement strategies, we were able to achieve a high response rate, minimizing response bias. These data suggest that robust qualitative research of gastroenterologists is possible using readily transferable techniques. (Table Presented).

%X Virtual environments offer a variety of benefits and may be a powerful medium with which to provide nursing education. The objective of this study was to compare the achievement of learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students when a virtual patient trainer or a traditional lecture was used to teach pediatric respiratory content. This was a randomized, controlled, posttest design. A virtual pediatric hospital unit was populated with four virtual pediatric patients having different respiratory diseases that were designed to meet the same learning objectives as a traditional lecture. The study began in Spring 2010 with 93 Senior I, baccalaureate nursing students. Students were randomized to receive either a traditional lecture or an experience with a virtual patient trainer. Students' knowledge acquisition was evaluated using multiple-choice questions, and knowledge application was measured as timeliness of care in two simulated clinical scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. Ninety-three students participated in the study, of which 46 were in the experimental group that received content using the virtual patient trainer. After the intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge acquisition (P = 0.004) and better knowledge application (P = 0.001) for each of the two scenarios than students in the control group. The purpose of this project was to compare a virtual patient trainer to a traditional lecture for the achievement of learning outcomes for pediatric respiratory content. Although the virtual patient trainer experience produced statistically better outcomes, the differences may not be clinically significant. The results suggest that a virtual patient trainer may be an effective substitute for the achievement of learning outcomes that are typically met using a traditional lecture format. Further research is needed to understand how best to integrate a virtual patient trainer into undergraduate nursing education.

%X This paper highlights findings from a literature search to examine the effects of patient simulation on students' self-efficacy and confidence. The old teaching method of "see one, do one and teach one" which has long been used to teach nursing skills and to promote the acquisition of clinical expertise is no longer accepted as the best way to teach students. A nurse's confidence in her/his ability is essential for good patient care. Only when nursing students have confidence in their own abilities are they able to shift focus to the needs of their patients. Shifting from their own needs to that of a patient is essential to being a safe and competent practitioner. A literature review was conducted to examine the available research findings relating to self-efficacy in the education of nurses, high-fidelity patient simulation effect on nurses' self-efficacy, and the effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation and its challenges.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the application of a Multidimensional Model of Clinical Leadership on the community healthcare leader and on transforming community services. BACKGROUND: Healthcare policy advocates clinical leadership as the vehicle to transform community and healthcare services. Few studies have identified the key components of an effective clinical leadership development model. DESIGN: The first two stages of Kirkpatrick's (Personnel Administrator 28, 1983, 62) Four/Five Levels of Evaluation were used to evaluate the application of the multidimensional model of clinical leadership. METHODS: Eighty community healthcare leaders were exposed to this multidimensional clinical leadership development model through attendance of a community clinical leadership development programme. Twenty five leaders participated in focus group interviews. Data from the interviews were analysed utilising thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged that influenced the development of best practice principles for clinical leadership development: 1. Personal leadership development 2. Organisational leadership 3. The importance of multiprofessional action learning/reflective groups CONCLUSIONS: Emergent best practice principles for clinical leadership development include adopting a multidimensional development approach. This approach encompasses: preparing the individual leader in the role and seeking organisational leadership development that promotes the vision and corporate values of the organisation and delivers on service improvement and innovation. Moreover, application of the Multidimensional Model of Clinical Leadership could offer the best platform for embedding the Six C's of Nursing (Compassion in Practice - Our Culture of Compassionate Care, Department of Health, Crown Copyright, 2012) within the culture of the healthcare organisation: care, compassion, courage, commitment, communication, and competency. This is achieved in part through the application of emotional intelligence to understand self and to develop the personal integrity of the healthcare leader and through supporting a culture of lifelong leadership learning. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Embedding the best practice principles of clinical leadership development within a multidimensional model of clinical leadership provides a promising approach to: equipping the healthcare leader with those transferable leadership skills required to help them embark on a journey of lifelong leadership learning; and producing the healthcare leader who is caring, compassionate and can confidently and effectively transform community services.

%X It is expected that there will be 178,700 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in American women during 1998. This corresponds to a new breast cancer diagnosis every 3 minutes. In the absence of any preventive measures at this time, control of breast cancer morbidity and mortality must be sought through early detection and treatment. A competency-based training curriculum in breast self-examination was developed that incorporated three specific skill components: a systematic pattern of search; palpation topography discrimination training; and use of appropriate finger pressure for examination. A computer-assisted breast model was built and piloted for use in this study. The design, implementation, and validation of this program as a platform to train women and advanced practice nurses in breast self-examination is described.

%X Learning Objective: To share the experience of an electronic incident reporting system that record incidents and near misses. Background: Incidents or near misses are often under reported as they are misunderstood as a disciplinary tool or viewed as a disciplinary record. To encourage the rate of reporting, the system has to be both transparent and user-friendly. It should be able to, 1 Record and classify incidents. 2 Evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. 3 Aid in the formulation of control measures to prevent future occurrences. 4 Archive data for future references. 5 Serve as a platform to for sharing and discussion. Procedure Details: 1 Incidents and near misses must be reported to respective section in-charge or his/her deputy in absence (i.e. Medical, Physics, Radiotherapy and Nursing). 2 Section in-charge/ deputy is responsible for the any immediate corrective measures needed. 3 The section in-charge/ deputy will complete the Electronic Incidental Reporting Form and sent it to the various section in-charge for comments. 4 The completed form is the review by committee for recommendations. Conclusion: Incident reporting is an important quality improvement tool. The consolidated data can then be archived and will form a database which would allow analysis to be carried out. It would allow for the review of past errors and the understanding of the root cause. This would reduce the risk of mistreatment. By going electronic, it makes both reporting easier and faster, thus encouraging staff to report incidents. It would also facilitate analysis and the lessons gained from the incident can be quickly reviewed and shared amongst fellow co-workers. This would prevent future similar incident from happening.

%X Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity/mortality in cancer pts. VTE is increasing and is the second cause of death in cancer pts, behind only cancer itself. In 2010 of the 186 unique hospitalized cancer pts at our institution with VTE, 25% were medical and 75% surgical. Gaps in clinician knowledge/practice of VTE prevention were evident. Methods: A interdisciplinary approach across clinical and administrative specialties was undertaken, with collaboration between: medical/surgical oncologists, MS leaders, pharmacists, nursing, and hospital departments of QI, information technology, and CME, to educate a target group of 120 cancer clinicians in VTE prophylaxis. In 2/2013 - 2/2014 multiplatform educational initiatives were utilized to reach physicians, advance practice/ward nurses and pharmacists: didactic lectures, Key Opinion Leader visiting professorships, online vignettes, VTE FAQ emails from MS QI leaders, small group sessions, e-learning modules. System changes such as standardized VTE prophylaxis order sets tailored for each service and strategically placed visual cues were also used. Results: Almost 3 times as many unique learners participated in these activities as were targeted. Learner satisfaction, knowledge acquisition and competency were high. Compliance with use of standardized order sets improved from 65 to 95% among the MS. Claims by clinicians of pt contraindications to prophylaxis were audited and found valid. Despite these improvements, incidence of VTE has not dropped, reflecting a national trend. Conclusions: With intensive and interdisciplinary effort, progressin clinician knowledge and performance in VTE prophylaxis can be made. This effort required considerable input from physician champions (eg., surgical oncologists with overlapping roles of clinician, QI advocate, and departmental leader, and medical oncologists with roles of clinician, CME and MS leader). This is a promising model for other QI initiatives.

%X Telehealth is defined as the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to extend health care service delivery across distance. Remote vital sign monitoring is a common example for home telehealth and one promising market, but lacks the breadth, comforting and subtleties of face-to-face assessments usually done by having either the patient go to the clinic or the clinician going to see the patient at home. To conduct more lively and interactive sessions, virtual visits involve the use of video and audio for live and remote consultations between clinicians and patients [1]. These consultations are done through fixed workstations or mobile devices using web videoconferencing systems, which may not always be sufficient to the practice of clinicians [2]. Objectives To provide flexibility to the interactions that would normally take place in face-to-face consultations, we are developing a multi-point, multi-view and multi-data (video, audio, medical devices) videoconferencing system, called VIGIL, to conduct live sessions between health caregivers (e.g., physiotherapists, occupational therapists, doctors, nurses) and patients at home. Methods Like Skype and OmniJoin/Nefsis, VIGIL is a cloud-based videoconferencing system working on mobile devices, laptops and workstations. VIGIL has customized and simple interfaces to improve usability for specific telehealth needs. For instance, it can transmit images from one or multiple cameras, control pan-tiltzoom (PTZ) cameras from a distance, and interface a mobile communication badge and a mobile PTZ camera for interaction away from the workstation. It can also receive data from wireless medical devices. Results VIGIL is currently hosted at Sherbrooke Techno-Centre and exploited in trials are underway at the Centre de réadaptation de l'Estrie. Discussion Technologically, it is possible to provide a diversity of interaction modalities in support of telehealth practice. It is now more a matter of finding out what is necessary to address those needs.

%X Objectives 1. Describe the planning and implementation of an innovative online palliative care educational program involving an academic/industry partnership. 2. Identify results of the educational program, including improvement in knowledge and reported confidence in delivering palliative care. 3. Discuss lessons learned, including online technological and operational challenges and successes. Background. The nursing home is a major setting for death and dying in the U.S., yet palliative care approaches are underused in these facilities. Nurse Practitioners working in nursing homes are well-suited to provide this care but most have not been formally educated about this specialty practice. This session describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of an online Palliative Care course to better prepare NPs across the country to direct and deliver high-quality palliative care to patients and families in nursing home settings. Research objectives. (1) Develop/deliver three learning modules. (2) Measure knowledge improvement by comparing pre/post test scores. (3) Describe relationships between demographic/ professional characteristics and examination scores. Method. 100 NPs divided into 3 sections participated in a 3-month online educational intervention. Using a within- and between-subjects design, statistical analysis included reliability/ validity of the examination and descriptive statistics. Results. (1) Characteristics of participants, (2) pre/posttest scores demonstrating knowledge gains, (3) program evaluations, and (4) postprogram confidence levels and perceived change in NP practice. Conclusion. (1) Personal/professional variables had minimal effect on test scores. (2) Internal consistency of the test was strong, demonstrated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient (.81); Kuder Richardson 20 (.81), Kuder Richardson 21 (.79) correlations. Statistically significant difference (p ≤ .0001) in mean pretest (M = 62.26; SD = 9.560) and posttest (M = 83.39; SD = 11.097) scores (MDif = 21.131; SD = 10.255; SEM = 1.031) demonstrated learning gains. (3) Extraordinarily positive program evaluations; 100% reported achievement of learning Objectives. (4) Level of confidence increased; 92.7% changed their practice following the program. Implications for research, policy, or practice. The distance learning approach was effective. The online format allowed participants convenient access; the web-based course management system provided a single point for course materials. The discussion board created a sense of community; without geographical boundaries, NPs across the U.S. were provided with a platform and encouraged to exchange ideas and discuss challenges they face in their practice.

%X Background & Hypothesis: This study investigates the effectiveness of Tri-Generational Homecare Project (TriGen) in reducing ageism amongst a cohort of medicine, nursing, pharmacy and social work undergraduates at National University of Singapore, and equipping them with interpersonal skills and awareness of healthcare issues. Methods: TriGen is a student-led, professionals-supported programme complementing Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Ageing-in-Place programme, a community-based healthcare programme targeting frequently admitted patients. Participants underwent training on misconceptions towards older persons and how to care for them, then, in interdisciplinary groups of 2 to 3, conducted home visits to at-risk elderly over 6-months and collaborated with AIP professionals at 2 multidisciplinary meetings. Participants completed Kogan's Attitudes towards Old People Scale (KOP) at the baseline and 6- months, and Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE) Survey Instrument at 6- months. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v23.0. Results: KOP scores (response rate: 83.3%; n = 45; mean age, 21.5; 66.6% female) significantly increased from 134.7 ± 12.8 to146.1 ± 14.5 (95% CI, 142.3-151.8; P <0.001). Higher scores imply less ageism, with 102 being neutral. For all 22 aspects surveyed in the FIPSE survey, >70% of respondents agreed that TriGen has helped them; 93.3% agreed that TriGen has helped them to think of others and 91.1% felt that TriGen has helped them to feel responsible for others in the community and appreciate teamwork and cooperation among peers. Discussion & Conclusion: After 6 months of participating in TriGen, students have significantly reduced ageism and are more thoughtful, empathetic and socially aware. A structured experiential service-learning approach thus appears to be a promising platform for reducing ageism and improving interpersonal skills and awareness of healthcare issues amongst future health professionals.

%X Objectives • Describe components of a regional palliative care training program for interdisciplinary providers. • Explain the composition and impact of a longitudinal mentoring program on development of the interdisciplinary palliative medicine team. • Describe practice improvement projects, the engagement of hospital leaders, and the impact of both on creating institutional change. Like many parts of the country, the greater Chicago area has experienced rapidly changing healthcare environments with increased demand for hospice and palliative medicine services (HPM). Limited resources and personnel to meet this need have led to great concern over interdisciplinary team (IDT) sustainability and provider burnout. In response, local HPM leaders, with support from the Coleman Foundation, developed and implemented the Coleman Palliative Medicine Training Program. This 2-year program utilizes multimodal educational strategies, including biannual workshops, evening group sessions, e-learning, and experiential training. From 2013 to 2015, the program trained 29 physicians and nurses from over 20 adult and pediatric healthcare systems seeking to start or improve HPM programs. Another cohort of 28 clinicians, which included social workers and chaplains, was added in 2015. Individual and group mentoring is provided by 39 regional IDT experts from academic and community-based HPM programs. Thirteen trainees from the first cohort also remained in the program as “junior mentors.” A leadership conference directed at HPM program directors and hospital leadership was convened in May 2015 aimed at aligning institutional goals and clinical initiatives to address the Institute of Medicine priorities. During this session we will describe unique features of this program including 1) IDT longitudinal mentoring support to ensure adequate clinical skill development and team resiliency; 2) individual and group practice improvement projects completed by program participants that address educational gaps, quality improvement efforts, or clinical program developments at their respective health institutions; 3) strategies used to engage hospital administrators and foster regional collaboration. Finally, we will explore the strengths, weakness, opportunities, and challenges of applicability of this program to other HPM professionals through an interdisciplinary small group discussion.

%X Context The rapid increase in demand for palliative care (PC) services has led to concerns regarding workforce shortages and threats to the resiliency of PC teams. Objectives To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a regional interdisciplinary training program in PC. Methods Thirty nurse and physician fellows representing 22 health systems across the Chicago region participated in a two-year PC training program. The curriculum was delivered through multiple conferences, self-directed e-learning, and individualized mentoring by expert local faculty (mentors). Fellows shadowed mentors' clinical practices and received guidance on designing, implementing, and evaluating a practice improvement project to address gaps in PC at their institutions. Results Enduring, interdisciplinary relationships were built at all levels across health care organizations. Fellows made significant increases in knowledge and self-reported confidence in adult and pediatric PC and program development skills and frequency performing these skills. Fellows and mentors reported high satisfaction with the educational program. Conclusion This interdisciplinary PC training model addressed local workforce issues by increasing the number of clinicians capable of providing PC. Unique features include individualized longitudinal mentoring, interdisciplinary education, on-site project implementation, and local network building. Future research will address the impact of the addition of social work and chaplain trainees to the program.

%X Objectives 1. Describe the creation and integration of a novel multicentered, longitudinal education and mentoring program for interdisciplinary providers: the Coleman Palliative Medicine Training Program. 2. Demonstrate the use of individual practice improvement projects to create meaningful, sustainable changes in palliative care services. 3. Practice the application of Intent to Change tools used in our program to engage learners and assist with goalsetting, project development, and mentorship. The growth of palliative medicine programs is dramatically outpacing the number of providers who are adequately trained to provide high-quality care to patients and families living with serious illness. In response, hospice and palliative medicine leaders across the greater Chicagoland area, with support from a local foundation, created the Coleman Palliative Medicine Training Program. This 2-year longitudinal program is currently training 35 doctors and nurses from 23 hospitals seeking to start or improve existing palliative medicine programs. During this session, we will describe essential components of this large-scale multicentered educational program, including recruitment tactics, curriculum development, and evaluation. Methods of teaching and community building will be highlighted, including e-learning through an openaccess website, biannual workshops, and direct observation of clinical skills with assigned mentors. One unique feature of this program involves the use of Intent to Change tools centered on learners' developing, implementing, and evaluating a practice improvement project to improve the quality of or access to primary palliative care services at their respective practice settings. Twenty-two mentors from 10 academic palliative medicine and hospice organizations provide direct observation opportunities and guidance around the implementation and evaluation of these projects throughout the 2-year program. During the interactive portion of this session, participants will review examples of practice improvement projects and employ the use of Intent to Change tools as a potential method to enhance interprofessional development at their home institution.

%X Rationale: Many youth with epilepsy (YWE) and their families have limited access to organized systems of care that provide comprehensive health interventions, particularly behavioral health. In 2004, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) created Project Access (PA) to provide grants to State and community agencies to improve awareness and access to comprehensive, coordinated epilepsy-related health care in rural and medically underserved areas. Grantees used existing systems, including telehealth, to implement their projects. We summarize two projects and how they demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of behavioral health initiatives in the context of the IOM recommendations. Methods: Phase III grants are focused on telehealth, care coordination, and mental health and are evaluated via six MCHB outcome measures for the community-based system of services mandated under State Title V programs. University of Nebraska Medical Center Munroe-Meyer Institute (MMI) has created 4 telehealth sub-sites that support medical consultations with urbanlocated specialists and is developing strategies to provide behavioral health care by a mental health provider associated with the telehealth hub. Services include parent training and assessment/treatment of depression and anxiety. At Cleveland Clinic, a needs assessment was conducted, and a psychosocial intervention, Collaboration for Outreach and Prevention Education for Children/Adolescents with Epilepsy (COPE) was developed. COPE includes 4 classes for caregivers and YWE and psychiatric screening and evaluation. A pediatric psychiatry triage clinic has also been created using the medical home model. Results: Results from the NE project indicate that each telehealth medical consultation saves 14.3 hours, 375 miles, and $450.00 for a family. The NE grantees are using lessons learned from medical telehealth visits to develop distance learning modules, state-based websites, social media support groups for isolated YWE and their families as well expanding access to mental health care through telemental-health options. The COPE survey (359 parents, 6 specialists, 37 school nurses, 7 key informants, and 12 primary care physicians) indicated that psychoeducational services are provided in their community but are not being accessed by families. Perceived stigma is a significant barrier. Preliminary results for COPE show that 2200 YWE have completed mental health screening and 720 have completed follow-up. 200 youth have received comprehensive psychiatric evaluations. 44 families have completed the COPE intervention. Conclusions: PA illustrates practical solutions to addressing IOM recommendations related to behavioral health of youth with epilepsy. Barriers to access to care can be ameliorated by use of existing demonstration programs and resources developed by PA grantees. This requires continued access to and dissemination of PA projects and strategies, which can serve as templates to inform future projects that address the IOM recommendations.

Principal investigator: Rural Veterans Telerehabilitation Initiative II: VA Office of Rural Health 10.10- 9.11, research grants. Development of Virtual Humans For PTSD and mTBI: Rehabilitation Outcomes Research Center 2010-2011, research grants. Objective: To create a prototype virtual grocery store where patients and therapists interact as avatars in an ecologically valid environment, to conduct cognitive rehabilitation and psychotherapy. The store must be accessible via the Internet. The patients and practitioners can connect in person or remotely. Design: A multidisciplinary team of clinicians and virtual reality technical experts engage in an iterative process to create the prototype. The most desirable elements of the virtual environment and virtual humans are determined by the clinical team, then developed by the technical team, and then reviewed by the clinical team. This process is repeated until the clinical team is satisfied with the result. Setting: A major university and Veterans Affairs medical center (VAMC). Participants: A clinical team (VAMC physiatrists, psychologists, neuropsychologists, physical therapists, advanced nurse practitioners, and occupational therapists who treat mild traumatic brain injury/posttraumatic stress disorder, and university computer artists and engineers. Interventions: The clinical and technical teams meet biweekly to identify key features for development, set goals, and engage in a process of analysis, critique, and modification. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical team's assessment of acceptability, relevance, and utility of the prototype. Results: The store currently boasts realistic shelves stocked with a variety of selectable items that 2 or more avatars can occupy. Avatars can push carts, experience minor or major collisions with other shoppers, open a virtual wallet, and pay for items. The number and appearance of other shoppers, noise level, amount of money can be chosen from the therapist's console. Discussion: The virtual store is an ideal setting to practice navigation, memory, list making, concentration, and calculation, as well as dual attention tasks. Similarly, real-world provocations and frustrations can be simulated. Endless task practice, in conventional or errorless learning encounters are being designed. Conclusions: It is feasible to create a virtual store to augment conventional cognitive therapy and psychotherapy. Next steps are to complete development and initiate randomized controlled trials.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEMOR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Can a 12 week program using text messaging and phone calls be used to adjust Lantus doses for type 2 insulin dependent diabetic patients of the Bellevue medical clinic? OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): In addition to evaluating the % of patients that reach their optimal Lantus dose in each arm, the MITI Study evaluates: 1. The feasibility of this type of study in a public hospital's outpatient medical clinic 2. If the intervention saves time and money 3. Patient satisfaction DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Remote Lantus insulin adjustment is appealing at a busy outpatient medicine clinic where appointment access can be limited and appealing to the low-income patients served by our hospital who often have to miss hours of work, make arrangements for the children in their care, and arrange transportation in order to come for an in-person clinic appointment. English or Spanish speaking patients in Bellevue's outpatient medical clinic who need their Lantus dose adjusted are randomized to two arms- the MITI intervention and usual care. MITI patients are enrolled in a secure web platform that texts them each weekday morning asking them to text back their fasting blood glucose. The MITI diabetes nurse reviews these numbers for alarm values daily. Each Thursday, the MITI diabetes nurse consults the (pre specified, MITI physician created) adjustment algorithms and calls patients advising them on Lantus dose titration. (When the diabetes nurse was unavailable on any given day of the study, the PI or coinvestigator reviewed for alarm values or made titration phone calls.) This process continues until the patients reach their optimal Lantus dose (defined as the Lantus dose that achieves one fasting blood glucose value less than or equal to 130, or the maximal dose of Lantus that can be safely given). Patients in the usual care group continue to come to in-person titration visits in the manner specified by their primary medical doctor. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): Our study measures four main areas 1) Clinical Effectiveness: The number of patients in each arm (MITI vs. usual care) that reach their optimal Lantus dose in 12 weeks. 2) Feasibility: The% of text message responses, the ability of the MITI nurse to reach patients via phone calls, and the volume of time spent by theMITI nurse. 3) Cost savings: The time saved by patients in the MITI armis measured by the usual travel time to and from clinic, the time spent in the waiting room prior to each appointment, and the copays that accompany in person visits. 4) Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction is measured using the validated Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks. FINDINGS TODATE (IT ISNOT SUFFICIENT TOSTATE FINDINGSWILL BE DISCUSSED): We had a pilot grant for 2013 and again for 2014. Each pilot grant allowed about 6 months of the active intervention which allowed us to enroll patients and follow them for 12weeks. In 2013, 27 eligible patients enrolled in the MITI Study, 13 in the MITI arm and 14 in usual care: Clinical outcome: All 13 MITI patients reached their optimal Lantus dose within 12 weeks, while only 5 usual care patients reached their optimal Lantus dose (100 vs. 35.7 %, p=<0.001). Feasibility outcome: 82.7 % of our text messages were returned by patients. The nurse was able to reach patients with a single phone call 54 % of the time, spent an average of <5 min a day checking for alarmvalues, and spent an average of only 15 min on titration phone calls on Thursdays. Cost savings: Patients saved an average of 45 min of transportation time to and from the clinic, saved a $15 co-pay for each visit, and the duration of the titration interaction was much shorter in the MITI arm (6 vs. 30 min for in-person visit). The waiting room time was not measured i 20 3 but is being measured in 2014. There was no increased utilization of Bellevue ER, walk-in, or med refill visits for the MITI arm patients. Satisfaction: The 12 week Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire showed that MITI patients reported higher satisfaction (p= 0.03) Other: There were 8 cases of mild hypoglycemia (5MITI, 3 in Usual Care, BG 60- 79). There was no increased use of Bellevue Hospital services in the MITI arm. The analysis of the 2014 data is ongoing. Enrollment ended 12/12/14 and 12 week data collection for these 2014 patients will end in March 2015. [Thus far we can report that 14 of 15 2014 MITI patients reached their optimal Lantus dose (within the 12weeks of the trial). The 15th patient is still within her 12 weeks. Feasibility, Cost saving, and Satisfaction data will follow] KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TOTHEIR PRACTICE ORCOMMUNITY?): Remote Lantus adjustment is effective, feasible, cost saving and satisfactory. Lantus can be adjusted remotely using basic cell phone technology and a low cost web platform in the medical clinic of a large public hospital. This intervention helps ease the burden on demand for access in a busy clinic, and provides patient centered care for low-income diabetic patients who have challenges coming to in-person appointments.

%X This theoretical research attempts to create a new basis for dialogue between two independent research fields that are connected by an inseparable link. The first, nursing science, is a body of professional knowledge, while the second, caring as an independent body of pure knowledge, conducts basic research with an aspiration towards applicability. This theoretical research uses the guidelines of the Buberian dialogue, which provides new meaning to the concept of clinical competence. The results emphasise the need to adopt abstract knowledge into the nursing field in order to improve the graduate's clinical capabilities. The combination of assessing clinical capability in a judgmental manner together with the dialogical humanistic approach of caring science may create a genuine platform and meeting event as a maturing process, which is intended to promote educational goals, which subsequently receive new meaning, that is, a different type of assessment. However, this assessment cannot be measured since a wide range of ethical moral aspects regarding both the student and the patient will have to be included. Nevertheless, this dialogue between nursing science and caring science can implement evidence on the basis of trust and can be used as a dialogical tool for evaluating clinical skills with the goal of empowering the educational field in nursing. Consequently, this clinical competence is called 'caring maturing means', and the goal is to convert the learning process into a meaningful event with the aim of improvement.

%X The advent of eLearning has seen online discussion forums widely used in both undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education. This paper reports an Australian university experience of design, delivery and redevelopment of a distance education module developed for Vietnamese nurse academics. The teaching experience of Vietnamese nurse academics is mixed and frequently limited. It was decided that the distance module should attempt to utilise the experience of senior Vietnamese nurse academics - asynchronous online discussion groups were used to facilitate this. Online discussion occurred in both Vietnamese and English and was moderated by an Australian academic working alongside a Vietnamese translator. This paper will discuss the design of an online learning environment for foreign correspondents, the resources and translation required to maximise the success of asynchronous online discussion groups, as well as the rationale of delivering complex content in a foreign language. While specifically addressing the first iteration of the first distance module designed, this paper will also address subsequent changes made for the second iteration of the module and comment on their success. While a translator is clearly a key component of success, the elements of simplicity and clarity combined with supportive online moderation must not be overlooked. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Human breast milk contains a diverse population of bacteria, but factors influencing the milk microbiota have not been described. Objective: We explored if maternal age, BMI, stage of lactation and infant feeding practices influenced bacterial communities in breast milk of indigenous mothers in the western highlands of Guatemala. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, unilateral milk samples were collected from Mam-Mayan women during early (5-46d, n=33) or established (4-6mo, n=43) lactation. Maternal age, BMI and feeding practices (exclusive, predominant and mixed feeding) were recorded. Milk bacterial communities were characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence treatment, taxonomy assignment and operational taxonomic unit counts were performed with customized scripts based on Mothur and Dada2 MiSeq protocols. Taxonomy assignment was based on a >95% confidence threshold. We compared normal (BMI 18.5-24.9) vs. overweight (BMI 25-30), early vs. established lactation and exclusive/predominant breastfeeding vs. mixed feeding. For all statistical tests, an effect size >1.0, a confidence interval >95% and a p-value and q-value <0.05 were considered significant. Results: Human milk bacterial community was altered by maternal BMI, stage of lactation, infant feeding practices whereas bacterial diversity was only affected by maternal age. The highest bacterial diversity occurred in mothers aged 22-24 (Shannon index 1.8) and the lowest bacterial diversity occurred in mothers aged 13-15 (Shannon index 1). At the phylum level, stage of lactation modified the proportion of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Firmicutes was >20% higher in early lactation and Proteobacteria was 30% higher in established lactation. A normal BMI was associated with higher proportions of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria at the class level. At the family level, exclusive/predominant breastfeeding when to compared to mixed feeding was associated with higher proportions of Corynebacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Rhodobacteraceae. Conclusion: Human breast milk bacterial communities are determined by a complex interplay of maternal factors, stage of lactation and infant feeding practices. Exclusive breastfeeding might be necessary for the shaping of a healthy microbiota in the nursing infant. Finally, our data demonstrate the need to better understand the factors that contribute to the establishment of human breast milk microbiota, which could in turn influence infant growth and development.

%X Background The Chinese Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CCUGH) was established within schools of public health in 2013 with the goal of enhancing global health in China. Expanding nursing students' exposure to global health curricula is important as nurses are essential actors in the health care system. However, information related to existing global health education within CCUGH-affiliated universities and the current engagement of Chinese schools of nursing in global health remains extremely limited. Objective To identify and describe the current definitions and conceptualizations of global health education in Chinese universities, with a focus on schools of nursing, in order to explore potential opportunities for strengthened collaboration between global health initiative and schools of nursing in China. Methods Purposive sampling with snowballing was used to recruit 19 key informants who were critical stakeholders in global health and nursing in China. Key informant interviews were conducted from July 2014 to February 2015, and data were updated in June 2016. Content analysis was used to analyze data via Atlas.ti 7. Results There was a rapid growth in global health education within and beyond CCUGH-affiliated universities with nine universities establishing global health institutes. Translation and definition of global health lacked consistency in Chinese language. Though no course directly related to global health was offered, schools of nursing were gradually participating in global health education and research. Nursing was a critical component of global health, and global health and nursing mutually advanced each other. Nursing education should include global health contents, but at present independent global health curriculum in schools of nursing was not appropriate. Conclusion Increasingly Chinese universities are promoting global health education through the platform of CCUGH. It is an ideal moment to promote and expand work across the fields of global health and nursing, specifically to highlight opportunities for collaboration across education, research and practice.

%X Aims. To examine the effectiveness of therapeutic play, using virtual reality computer games, in minimising anxiety and reducing depressive symptoms in Hong Kong Chinese children hospitalised with cancer. Background. There has been an increase in the use of therapeutic play intervention to help children cope with the stress of hospitalisation. However, it is not clear whether therapeutic play is an appropriate psychological intervention for Chinese children hospitalised with cancer. Design. A non-equivalent control group pretest-post-test, between-subject design was employed. Method. Hong Kong Chinese Children (8-16years of age), admitted to a paediatric oncology ward for the treatment of cancer during a 14-month period, were invited to participate in the study. Of the 122 children, 70 formed the control group receiving routine nursing care and 52 in the experimental group receiving therapeutic play interventions. Results. The results showed that children in the experimental group reported statistically significant fewer depressive symptoms than children in the control group on day 7. The results, however, find no differences in children's anxiety scores between the two groups on day 7. Conclusion. The study provides empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic play, using virtual reality computer games, in the psychological preparation of children hospitalised with cancer, thus charting a path towards promoting holistic and quality care. Relevance to clinical practice. The findings heighten the awareness in healthcare professionals that play is a very important part of children's life and that they need play even when they are ill. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X In 2009, the Department of Health, part of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced the advent of electronic medical records to reduce medical expenses and facilitate the international exchange of medical record information. An information technology platform for nursing records in medical institutions was then quickly established, which improved nursing information systems and electronic databases. The purpose of the present study was to explore the usability of the data mining techniques to enhance completeness and ensure consistency of nursing records in the database system.First, the study used a Chinese word-segmenting system on common and special terms often used by the nursing staff. We also used text-mining techniques to collect keywords and create a keyword lexicon. We then used an association rule and artificial neural network to measure the correlation and forecasting capability for keywords. Finally, nursing staff members were provided with an on-screen pop-up menu to use when establishing nursing records. Our study found that by using mining techniques we were able to create a powerful keyword lexicon and establish a forecasting model for nursing diagnoses, ensuring the consistency of nursing terminology and improving the nursing staff's work efficiency and productivity.

%X BACKGROUND: Virtual patient simulation has grown substantially in health care education. A virtual patient simulation was developed as a refresher training course to reinforce nursing clinical performance in assessing and managing deteriorating patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the development of the virtual patient simulation and evaluate its efficacy, by comparing with a conventional mannequin-based simulation, for improving the nursing students' performances in assessing and managing patients with clinical deterioration. METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 57 third-year nursing students who were recruited through email. After a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated environment, the experimental group received a 2-hour fully automated virtual patient simulation while the control group received 2-hour facilitator-led mannequin-based simulation training. All participants were then re-tested one day (first posttest) and 2.5 months (second posttest) after the intervention. The participants from the experimental group completed a survey to evaluate their learning experiences with the newly developed virtual patient simulation. RESULTS: Compared to their baseline scores, both experimental and control groups demonstrated significant improvements (P<.001) in first and second post-test scores. While the experimental group had significantly lower (P<.05) second post-test scores compared with the first post-test scores, no significant difference (P=.94) was found between these two scores for the control group. The scores between groups did not differ significantly over time (P=.17). The virtual patient simulation was rated positively. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual patient simulation for a refreshing training course on assessing and managing clinical deterioration was developed. Although the randomized controlled study did not show that the virtual patient simulation was superior to mannequin-based simulation, both simulations have demonstrated to be effective refresher learning strategies for improving nursing students' clinical performance. Given the greater resource requirements of mannequin-based simulation, the virtual patient simulation provides a more promising alternative learning strategy to mitigate the decay of clinical performance over time.

%X AIM: To explore the effect of an innovative simulation education programme on nursing students' transition-to-practice experiences. BACKGROUND: Academic-practice partnership is emerging as an important vehicle for improving nursing students' transition-to-practice. Using existing university resources, academic educators and alumni developed an innovative simulation educational programme known as the Simulated Professional Learning Environment (SIMPLE) to align the educational process with the realities of nursing practice. Educators and alumni collaborated to create and facilitate 15 hours of simulation sessions that comprised the learning platform for the SIMPLE programme. DESIGN: This was a descriptive qualitative study. METHOD: Focus groups were conducted in 2012 with 22 final-year nursing students completing their transition-to-practice clinical practicum. The interview transcripts were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified from the analysis: 'experiencing the role of staff nurse'; 'knowing how to'; and 'learning from the 'seniors'. Experiencing the role of staff nurse in the programme showed the nursing students what to expect and how to prepare for their roles. Knowing how to focus on holistic patient care, manage 'difficult' clients and communicate with other healthcare professionals were the learning outcomes gained from the programme. Learning from the 'seniors' about hospital work processes positively influenced the nurses' transition-to-practice experiences. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for introducing the simulation education programme as an enhancement during nursing students' final year to improve their transition-to-practice experiences. A stronger collaborative relationship between academic educators and practising nurses could be further fostered by expanding this learning platform.

%X BACKGROUND: Web-based learning is becoming an increasingly important instructional tool in nursing education. Multimedia advancements offer the potential for creating authentic nursing activities for developing nursing competency in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive multimedia Web-based simulation for developing nurses' competencies in acute nursing care. METHODS: Authentic nursing activities were developed in a Web-based simulation using a variety of instructional strategies including animation video, multimedia instructional material, virtual patients, and online quizzes. A randomized controlled study was conducted on 67 registered nurses who were recruited from the general ward units of an acute care tertiary hospital. Following a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated clinical setting, the experimental group received 3 hours of Web-based simulation and completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions of the program. All participants were re-tested for their clinical performances using a validated tool. RESULTS: The clinical performance posttest scores of the experimental group improved significantly (P<.001) from the pretest scores after the Web-based simulation. In addition, compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher clinical performance posttest scores (P<.001) after controlling the pretest scores. The participants from the experimental group were satisfied with their learning experience and gave positive ratings for the quality of the Web-based simulation. Themes emerging from the comments about the most valuable aspects of the Web-based simulation include relevance to practice, instructional strategies, and fostering problem solving. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in authentic nursing activities using interactive multimedia Web-based simulation can enhance nurses' competencies in acute care. Web-based simulations provide a promising educational tool in institutions where large groups of nurses need to be trained in acute nursing care and accessibility to repetitive training is essential for achieving long-term retention of clinical competency.

%X During the mid 19th century, herbal remedies were the platform for a major health reform movement in America known as the Botanical Medical Movement (BMM). A number of histories have been written on the BMM from the perspectives of physicians and pharmacists. PURPOSE: This article describes the history of nurse-herbalism during the period and the impact that Shaker nurses, in particular, had on the BMM. METHOD: The article traces the history and findings of a triangulated case study. FINDINGS: Shaker nurses used herbs extensively in their caring and curing practices. They applied the botanical remedies recommended by BMM leaders. The nurses were also expert herbal medicine makers who used their own remedies in patient care. CONCLUSIONS: The Shaker infirmary was the nurses' behind-the-scenes research and development laboratory for the Shaker herbal cottage industry, which ultimately developed into an international, entrepreneurial endeavor. The Shaker infirmary was the nurses' organized proving ground for the implementation of the botanical health reforms of the mid 19th century. The nurse-herbalists' contribution to the promotion and production of herbal remedies had a significant impact on the success of botanical health reform in America.

%X Introduction: Throughout the history of nursing, the discoveries and system of belief of yesterday have served as a platform for the innovations of today. That is especially true for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach, exactly indeed perioperative practitioners have been challenged to stay abreast of technology in a field that is a constantly changing landscape of new techniques and improved instruments and equipment. The “laparoscopic revolution” of the 1980s propelled and encouraged the changes towards a less invasive approaches and new techniques, such as modern robotic-assisted surgery. Science and technology are advancing at an incredible pace and a critical analysis of these new developments become a duty in the perioperative nursing. Nurses, as a member of Robotic Surgical team must represented very good level of professional knowledge, and be an expert in robotic technology, playing a key role in data collection, analyzing trends and outcomes, and identifying safety issues. The professional nursing staff has an important responsibility to work following best-practice rules, and to analyze periodically roles and habits. This could be an effective instrument in order to improve every-day practice. A team training that involves all members of the robotic surgical team learning together, is the main key to ensuring patient advocacy and safe care. Creation and application of guide lines and specific protocols is giving positive results in daily practice as well. Conclusions: The role of robotics nurse specialist is both challenging and exciting because the technology is so new and the role is open to interpretation and definition - needs of job description. Daily practice showed us the needs of continues education, especially regarding e nursing skills, creation and revision of guide lines and specific protocols.

The “laparoscopic revolution” of the 1980s propelled and encouraged the changes towards a less invasive approaches and new techniques, such as modern robotic-assisted surgery. Use of robotics is expanding rapidly in the medical arena. The evolution of robotics in surgery is presented within the context of virtual reality, telepresence, telemanipulation, and robotic surgical system. A critical analysis of these new developments become a duty in the perioperative nursing. Minimally invasive surgeries, including robotic-assisted surgeries, are performed as routine in European Institute of Oncology, especially in genitourinary, gynecology, general, thoracic, head & neck surgery and breast surgery. The goals of our investigation were: 1. To assess needs of cancer patients undergoing robotic surgeries in different specialties, regarding preparation, mentioning physical and psychological needs, 2. To assess a multidisciplinary team collaboration during robotic surgeries, 3. Nursing role description, and the specific 'learning-curve' of the beginner nurses. Methods: The investigation conducted at the European Institute of Oncology in Operating theatre by nurses involved in robotic surgery procedures. During thousand robotic surgical procedures in different surgical specialty was registered a data using specifically designed form and analyzed daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.

%X Background/Case Studies: Hospital staff (HS) are challenged to keep abreast of current industry trends and knowledge to maintain quality processes for compliance and patient care. Funding of off-site continuing education (CE) is limited, if available at all for HS. Human capital is also limited to support work processes, when HS are off-site for CE. A large blood center (BC) consulting division has implemented a refined approach to webinar (WEB) presentations for CE as a value-added benefit for the hospital customer (HC) educational needs. Study Design/Methods: The BC selected the web-based GoToWebinar to deliver the WEBs. The method allows the BC to schedule and deliver hot topics in an efficient and timely way. The WEBs cover regulatory/compliance topics, as well as clinically based, patient-focused applications. The WEBs are scheduled for 1 hour (10 AM PT-1PM ET) on a quarterly basis. HC in 20 states are invited by email which includes the topic and the registration link for the live presentation. An encore WEB is provided a month later for those who could not attend the first presentation. The presentation handouts are emailed to the registrants the evening before the presentation. The WEBs are recorded and available along with certificates of attendance (CA) for up to 6 months after the presentation on the BC's website. Each WEB can support a maximum of 500 registrants. During the WEB, there is an opportunity depending on topic, for participants to answer polling questions. Each WEB has a question and answer period at the end of the presentation. Participants have the capability to evaluate the WEB and print CA issued electronically after the WEB. Results/Findings: The WEBs began in July 2011. To date, 12 topics and 24 WEBs have been presented to 1645 registrants. WEB attendees include laboratory directors, supervisors, technologists, nurses, and physicians. An average of 187 people have clicked the registration link (range 88-295) and the average number of registrations is 137 (range 77-221). The WEB topics, “Adverse Reactions to Transfusion” and “Transfusion Administration-Getting the Right Blood to the Right Patient Every Time” were utilized for CE training for hospital transfusionists by some HC. The average number of questions generated during a presentation is 13 (range 2-36); the two WEBs with more regulatory focus, “Biological Product Deviation Reports” and “Competency Assessment-Is Your Program Competent?” generated the most questions, 54 and 45, respectively. Conclusion: The WEBs provide HC with an easy, timely, and pertinent educational opportunity to enhance their knowledge on blood industry topics provided in a cost-effective manner. It also allows for the BC to communicate current industry topics consistently across its entire customer base. Since WEB participation can be done individually or as a group, the WEBs facilitate discussion related to the HC's policies and procedures, while providing CE hours for the participants.

%X Program/Project Purpose: Medical Students Providing Across Continents (MedPACt), of the University of Central Florida College of Medicine (UCF COM), began developing a medical service trip to the Dominican Republic in 2011. Their project is to implement a portable, self-contained Electronic Health Record (EHR). Since 2012, the EHR program used is an OpenMRS module built by Partners in Health and the Regenstrief Institute. MedPACt is in partnership with UCF Undergraduate - Information Technology, in order to manage the EHR modifications specific for this service trip. The purpose of the EHR is to deliver a long-term patient record that is transportable and customizable to the local communities of the Dominican Republic for sustainable healthcare and assessment of community needs. In addition, MedPACt aims to implement the EHR to expose future clinicians to it and improve their patient interviewing and record keeping skills. Structure/Method/Design: The primary goals of this year's trip were to improve both student EHR utility and clinic accessibility and efficiency. Participants that used the EHR included UCF students - medical, nursing, and engineering - and University of Florida pharmacy students. The students were chosen based on international medical service trip experience. Sustainability was created through medical student created workshops which involved platform setup and interface walkthrough. EHR use in a clinical setting was practiced with Spanish speaking standardized patients in the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center at the UCF COM. Additionally, Wi-Fi extenders and a patient routing system were added to improve the clinic. During the service trip, the data was recorded on UCF COM issued iPads with portable keyboards which then delivered data wirelessly to a Latitude E6410 server laptop powered by a transportable gasoline generator. Outcomes & Evaluation: Improved server function allowed the EMR to fully function for the duration of the trip without unmanageable outages, which was an improvement compared to previous years. A total of 573 patients were seen over 5 days and all were successfully recorded into the EMR, which is more than any previous year. A post-trip survey was conducted and indicated an improvement of the user interface compared to prior years, however there is still a need to improve EHR use during times of large patient intake. Going Forward: The challenge of improving the interface for future service trips involves further interface customization to a more concise yet equally effective, student-friendly version, and improving the routing of patients. Unmet goals include implementation of a photo identification system, which would enhance documentation and overall clinic privacy and functionality.

%X Maintaining high quality in Web-based learning is a powerful means of increasing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of distance learning. Many studies have evaluated Web-based learning but seldom evaluate from the information systems (IS) perspective. This study applied the famous IS Success model in measuring the quality of a Web-based learning system using a Web-based questionnaire for data collection. One hundred and fifty four nurses participated in the survey. Based on confirmatory factor analysis, the variables of the research model fit for measuring the quality of a Web-based learning system. As Web-based education continues to grow worldwide, the results of this study may assist the system adopter (hospital executives), the learner (nurses), and the system designers in making reasonable and informed judgments with regard to the quality of Web-based learning system in continuing professional education.

%X BACKGROUND: Some nursing educators have been using blogs as a channel to reflect on, share, and discuss questions and ideas for educational purpose. There were not many studies focused on the application of blog technology to the professional development of nursing education in Taiwan. OBJECTIVES: The major goal of this study was to use a blog platform for students, writing their reflection notes, and observing the feedbacks from peers during their clinical practicum. Then we tried to probe the nursing students' attitude toward adopting 3-R categories based blog, which included wRiting reflection notes, Reading peers' notes, and Receiving peers' feedback. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 179 fourth grade from one five-year technical college students enrolled in a clinical practice course in Taiwan were used as a pool of sampling. Four-eight students were invited by the researcher to take part in this project. RESULTS: 90% of the participants agreed that blogs provided them with opportunities to share personal experiences with others. 81% of them valued that blogs provided opportunities to offering encouragement and emotional support to their peers. A majority of the participants believed that reading peers' journals was helpful in enhancing their professional development. In addition, all of them agreed that reading peers' journals can help them understand their peer's viewpoints. Most of the participants agreed that they were benefited through receiving feedbacks on the blogs. About 98% of them agreed that feedbacks can promote interaction with peers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study generally indicated the participants' positive attitude toward using blogs in their clinical practicum. A majority of the participants also claimed that blogs provided them the opportunities to share personal experiences with their peers as well as to see things from their peers' viewpoints. They believed that reading peers' notes was helpful in enhancing their professional development. In addition, most of them agreed that receiving feedbacks could promote in-depth reflections; therefore, they were encouraged to write more reflective notes. Thus, future clinical practicum design should exert efforts to foster students' collaboration, reflections, and dialogues by providing blog platform.

%X BACKGROUND & PROBLEMS: Incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD) is a common skin disorder in critical patients who suffer from fecal incontinence. Symptoms of IAD include pain, redness, swelling, and, in some cases, secondary infections. IAD is thus a major problem faced in critical nursing care. The incidence of incontinence associated dermatitis averaged 34.72% at the intensive care unit in our hospital from October to December 2013. The factors that we identified as associated with IAD included: (1) Nurses: incorrect nursing care and insufficient IAD-related knowledge among nurses; (2) DEVICES: lack of skin barrier products and the use of diapers with poor air ventilation; (3) Regulations: lack of IAD care standards and lack of auditing oversight; (4) Patient problems: skin edema, incontinence, and medication use. PURPOSE: To decrease the incidence of IAD from 34.72% to 22%. METHODS: The authors searched the Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHI, and Nursing Reference Center databases for relevant articles that were published from 2000 to 2014. Fifty studies were identified and four evidence-based references were selected for follow-up assessment. Levels of evidence were at levels 2 and 3. We designed an intervention that: (1) set a high-risk notice to increase awareness; (2) held six in-service training programs; (3) developed nursing standards and designed e-learning education lessons that specifically targeted reducing the incidence of IAD; (4) established a regular audit system. RESULT: The incidence of IAD decreased from 34.72% pretest to 19.8% posttest (posttest period: April - October 2014). CONCLUSION: This project effectively reduced the incidence of IAD in high-risk patients in our intensive care unit. The authors established evidence-based interventions that significantly improved patient outcomes.

%X PURPOSE: Clinical pathway is refer to the optimal care process of a particular diagnosis or procedure. Multidisciplinary professionals make rules including doctors, pharmacists,nurses and managements. It is proved to be an effective and improved tool that rationalizing clinical schedule arrangements, ensuring patients better medical care, meanwhile, promoting cost-effectiveness of clinical services. Clinical pharmacists play an important role during the whole process as participants and supervisors. Therefore, this study is to explore the mode of clinical pharmacists in managing clinical pathway and promoting rational drug use. METHODS: According to the guideline of clinical pathway or single disease promulgated by National Health and Family planning Commission of China and Special prescription reviews of Beijing Medical Institutions. The electronic medical record system of 88 clinical pathway diseases in 22 clinical departments in Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University was given the drug rationality review. RESULTS: In 44 diseases about the perioperative use of antimicrobial agents, 31.58% are variety choice inappropriately, 13.64% are dose timing appropriately, the main factors including economics and covering the spectrum of organisms too many. In support therapy of 88 diseases, 30.68% variety choice inappropriately, 18.18% directions appropriately, 4.5% solvent poor choices. Main problems including economics and did not give attention to both liver and kidney function and the dose of elderly patients with adjustment. CONCLUSION: Economics is major problem influencing on the rationality of clinical pathways, at the same time the safety of special groups should be ensured. Right antimicrobial drugs and proper timing choose can be a powerful weapon to control antimicrobial drugs. Checking the clinical pathway administration template can be used as a platform for clinical pharmacists to managing the clinical pathway and promoting the rational drug use.

%X Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) rounds provide medical care providers the opportunity to review patient cases, identify errors and provide recommendations for change and opportunities for clinical or process improvements. This quality improvement activity has traditionally been a physician led initiative that is presented in a round-table, didactic format. Some programs have a multidisciplinary approach to M & M rounds which may include nursing, pharmacy or other allied health professionals. At St Paul's Hospital, the Heart Centre M&M rounds are held monthly and are primarily attended by the leadership team, physicians and advanced practice nurses. Nurses in our interventional cardiology unit do not have a consistent or formal platform to examine potential or real adverse patient events. Therefore, we developed a nurse led quality improvement forum that aligns with the goals and purpose of M & M rounds but are uniquely tailored to the nurses who provide direct patient care. These rounds are for nurses, presented by nurses and seek to enhance nursing care and patient safety. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the development and implementation of quality improvement nursing rounds in the setting of an interventional cardiology unit. We will discuss ways in which we adapted the traditional M&M format, and how patient cases are selected and reviewed. We will report on how our adapted M&M rounds enhanced nursing practice and improved patient safety. We will also share our evaluation and feedback received since implementation.

%X Context We describe the development of an e-learning programme for ST1-ST8 paediatric trainees. This was innovated and developed by two trainees and funded by the local deanery. The e-learning platform was developed in conjunction with the local University and Childrens Hospital. The programme is also hosted on MedsIQ and is likely to be used by other deaneries in due course. Problem Children are at particular risk of medications errors, and the RCPCH has identified that there is need for improved prescribing in response to gross medication errors affecting children. In-patient paediatric prescribing errors occur in around 13% of prescriptions. Despite this, trainees or non-medical prescribers have no specific training in prescribing for children, or opportunity for continuing professional development. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes We asked local trainees (ST1-ST8) via questionnaire about competence in prescribing and the frequency of error. 90% of trainees had made a prescribing error and 30% had an incident report generated about an error. 80% felt that an e-learning tool to improve prescribing would be helpful. Deficiencies in prescribing competence and knowledge amongst senior trainees has been identified in those undertaking START. Intervention We have developed 25 e-learning modules focused on practical safe prescribing for children. We put together an editorial board led by trainees and comprising of pharmacists, nurse prescribers and consultants. We produced a list of modules by trainee focus group and based on the curriculum. Local authors were identified for each module and were usually a trainee and pharmacist with senior support. We utilised an elearning platform already developed for a foundation-year prescribing programme (SCRIPT). The modules take around 1 h to complete and are practical, using cases and audiovisual material and interactive in-module assessments (see Figure 1 for examples from modules). There are pre and post-test questionnaire to assess in-module progress. Focus groups of trainees were used to design length of modules and the e-learning interface. The modules are outlined in Table 1. Strategy for change There are currently 6 modules 'live' and all 25 modules will be launched by March 2016. These will initially be available to all paediatric trainees in the region and hosted on MedsIQ. ST1-ST8 local trainees will be required to complete all modules by the time of START assessment. Modules will also be available to other deaneries by request. Measurement of improvement and effect of change We can use data generated by the modules to assess individual improvement throughout the modules. User feedback can be sent back and modules will be continually improved/updated. We will also assess confidence and competence by self-reported error and national incident reporting levels amongst trainees undertaking paediatric SCRIPT. We will also look at prescribing outcome from the START assessment and level of prescribing error in trainees in each trust. SCRIPT for foundation doctors has led to significant improvement in confidence around prescribing; 75% found it had positively impacted upon prescribing knowledge and skill, and 73% had changed aspects of practice. It also won a National Patient Safety award in 2013. Message Children are at significant risk from prescribing errors. Despite this there is little specific practical prescribing training available. We have developed an innovative interactive e-learning programme in prescribing skills for trainees and non-medical prescribers. This e-learning package is unique and designed to target the needs of trainees from ST1 through to ST8 and can be used as a reference tool. The aim is to increase competence in prescribing and reduce error thus reducing patient harm. (Figure Presented).

%X Introduction: Delirium is a serious, under-recognized condition experienced by many hospitalized elderly patients with negative impacts on patient outcomes and health care costs. Best practice evidence for delirium care indicates that key to recognizing delirium is having an understanding of the patient's baseline cognition. Through chart audits, it was identified that information on patient's cognitive baseline was being collected and documented by multiple health care professionals in multiple places in the patient chart. This created a challenge in being able to easily locate information on the patient's cognitive baseline in order to assess for any fluctuations that may indicate the onset of delirium. In addition to knowing the patient's cognitive baseline, Best practice guidelines (BPGs) outline additional recommendations for delirium care including the use of structured screening processes to detect delirium and inter-professional multicomponent management strategies. Delirium care was identified as a quality improvement target in one Academic Health Science Centre. Chart audits were conducted to better understand the 'current state' of delirium care and inform the development of targeted BPG improvement interventions. Research Ethics Board approval was obtained from the hospital's REB. Chart audits of surgical and medical patients examined documentation of patient's cognitive baseline, delirium detection, documentation and interventions, to evaluate BPG recommendation concordance/adherence. Methods: Retrospective chart audits of all patients over the age of 50 admitted to one medical and one surgical unit during the month of February 2012 were reviewed and the data was analyzed. Results: 186 charts were reviewed. Results revealed that only 4 (2.2%) patients had their baseline functioning, cognition, behavior and mood documented. The lack of documentation of patients' baseline made determining if someone was delirious a challenge. 17 patients (9.1%) had a physician-documented diagnosis of delirium, 148 (79.6%) had no delirium diagnosis noted, and 21 additional (11.3%) patients were identified by the reviewer as likely having undiagnosed delirium, based on nursing and/or physician documentation of acute mental status change. Of the patients with delirium, 14 (82.3%) received a delirium workup, 5 (29.4%) had environmental management strategies documented, 9 (52.9%) received a medication review, 9 (52.9%) received neuroleptic treatment, and 6 (35.3%) had the delirium diagnosis noted in their discharge summary. Despite established standards, Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) screening for delirium was not completed by nurses for 13 patients (7.0%). Of patients with a physician diagnosis of delirium, 35% had negative nursing CAM screens throughout their admission and 29% had no delirium symptoms documented by nurses, highlighting discordance in nursing assessment and documentation. The nursing documentation was reviewed, including the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) screen for delirium. Patients with a physician diagnosis of delirium were more likely to have a positive CAM (p<0.001, Cramer's V =.736) and nursing documentation about delirium symptoms (p<0.001, Cramer's V =.755). Of patients with a physician diagnosis of delirium, 35% had negative CAM screens throughout their admission and 29% had no delirium symptoms documented by nurses. Thus, gaps in nursing assessment and documentation were noted. The chart audit results were shared with key stakeholders and BPG recommendations were prioritized for implementation. In alignment with the delirium literature, these results highlighted that delirium was being missed by both nurses and physicians, putting patients at risk of poorer health outcomes and adverse effects. Based on these results, the interdisciplinary team of reviewers engaged with stakeholders from various disciplines to improve delirium care. Conclusions: The chart audits powerfully confirmed that delirium under-recognition and under-treatment were key targets for Best Practice Guideline implementatio an created a 'burning platform' to improve delirium care. Improvement targets prioritized include development of an interdisciplinary baseline information collection tool, multimodel education on use of the CAM screening tool and development of standardized delirium management care plans.

%X Achieving and sustaining good blood pressure control continues to be a challenge for many reasons including nonadherence with prescribed treatment and lifestyle measures, shortage of primary care physicians especially in less populated areas, and variations in physicians' practice behaviour. Many strategies have been advocated to improve outcomes with the greatest success being achieved using nurse or pharmacist-led interventions in which they were given the authority to prescribe or alter antihypertensive treatment. However, this treatment approach, which historically involved 1-on-1 visits to a doctor's office or pharmacy, proved costly, was not scalable, and did not actively engage patients in treatment decision-making. Several electronic health interventions have been designed to overcome these limitations. Though more patient-centred and often effective, they required wired connections and a personal computer, and logging on for Internet access and navigating computer screens greatly reduced access for many older patients. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the benefits were related to better case management or technological advances. Mobile health (mHealth) technology circumvents the technical challenges of electronic health systems and provides a more flexible platform to enhance patient self-care. mHealth applications are particularly appropriate for interventions that depend on patients' sustained adherence to monitoring schedules and prescribed treatments. Studies from our group in hypertension and other chronic conditions have shown improved health outcomes using mHealth applications that have undergone rigourous usability testing. Nonetheless, the inability of most electronic medical record systems to receive and process information from mobile devices continues to be a major impediment in realizing the full potential of mHealth technology. © 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

%X Background: Diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) is an autoimmune disease that manifests in childhood or adolescence, promoted by progressive immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency in the body, which makes patients dependent on insulin. The complexity of the treatment that includes: medication adjustments, nutrition education, blood glucose monitoring and changes in lifestyle habits, factors that lead to difficulty in adherence proposal. The diagnosis affects not only the child but the whole family structure, with impact on the day-To-day and emotional and affective sphere. Education is fundamental to motivate the patient to acquire knowledge and skills promoting self-management of DM1 care generating changes in behavior and better quality of life. Objective: To provide better adherence to treatment, disease control and better quality of life by reducing the risk of complications. Materials and methods: Monthly educational meetings at a clinic for pediatric specialties, reference to disadvantaged communities of São Paulo, aimed at children with DM1 and their families. The education group in diabetes happens through group education, interactive group, educational games, cooking classes, Practice staff training patients to selfadminister insulin, and self-blood glucose monitoring, physical and recreational activities with professionals from an interdisciplinary team (endocrinologist, nutritionist, gastronomy, nurse, psychologist, pharmacist, physical educator and volunteer). Results: Reports of children and their families show that the group not only contributes to the control of the disease but makes a difference in the life of each. "I learned to give more freedom my daughter and so she learned to take care, to apply insulin, have more confidence, be more independent." "I learned to share what I know with others and learned from them too." "In addition to taking questions, it helps to let off steam and have more confidence.". Conclusion: A multidisciplinary approach, using unconventional therapeutic resources (educational and recreational), if It shows extremely important in diabetes education as a way to increase awareness and acceptance of the disease, through exchanges of experience, technical skills and involvement in decision-making in relation to self-care.

%X Background and objective: Medical errors (MEs) and potential adverse drugs events (pADEs) are common in paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PNICU) [1]. Several technical or organizational strategies have been proposed to decrease the rate of MEs and pADEs including Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) or Clinical Pharmacist (CP). However, some MEs are specifics of a CPOE and appear after implementation. Furthermore, the implementation of a CPOE has an impact on the organization of health care units and requires formations for physicians and nurses. Our objective is to develop an e-learning program for physicians and nurses in order to prevent the apparition of medicals errors related to CPOE. Setting and method: The choice of the support for the e-learning program is based on the simplicity of the utilization, the accessibility online and offline and the practicability aspect of the support. We decided to focus on medical prescription, which are the leading cause of medical errors in PNICU, for this e-learning program [1]. Results: The online support Prezi® was used based on its accessibility and its simplicity. We perform video capture of all kind of prescriptions with explanations on how to do a good prescription. Explanations are comments, inserted at each step of videos captures of medical prescriptions, using specific software. We also focus on specificities and details of the CPOE. The link of this e-learning program was send to all physicians and residents of the PNICU. Presentations of this online support have already been done in the PNICU. Conclusions: The Prezi® Support allowed us to build an e-learning program easily and fast. In order to evaluate this e-learning program and to assess its efficiency on medical errors, we will perform a comparative and prospective study, with medicals errors as a main outcome.

%X We studied the current literature on human patient simulation for preparing anesthesia and other healthcare providers for advanced airway management. A systematic review was conducted of articles published between 1990 and 2009 on advanced airway management for patients undergoing anesthesia and patients who are not. The search used 4 electronic databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. We included 34 articles in the analysis; 15 were experimental or quasi-experimental designs, 8 descriptive studies and reports, and 11 analyses of equipment or technique evaluations using simulation. The majority of the studies included simulation education evaluation for a variety of medical, nursing, and allied health providers and students. Only 6 studies addressed the use of simulation as an educational or evaluation tool to enhance training of anesthesia providers in difficult airway management. Those studies included analyses of different types of training and the perceived value of simulated training, and evaluations of equipment. Few studies have analyzed the effects of this modality on trainer skills and patient safety. There is a clear need for well-designed studies to examine these effects.

%X Introduction: Today, social media (SM) are used to supplement and enhance lifelong medical education and training. Safe medical practice builds on repetitions and routines. Accordingly, European Trauma Course (ETC) teaches standardized approach to trauma patient management, playing important role in improving chain of trauma care. In this study we aimed to investigate SM engagement among ETC instructors during their preparation for trauma courses in Austria. Materials and methods: A total of 42 (84%) of 50 instructors completed an online survey, consisted of questions regarding engagement on following SM platforms: Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Twitter, Wikipedia, and blogs. There were thirteen female and twenty nine male, aged from 27 to 69 years (median 38, IQR 11). More than half were anaesthetists (n = 28), along with emergency physicians (n = 8), surgeons (n = 3) and nurses (n = 3). The majority come from Austria (n = 25), accompanied by instructors from Croatia, Poland, Slovenia, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Canada and Hungary. Results: Our instructors are avid supporters of SM. Among them the majority has Facebook (62%), and around half YouTube (52%) and LinkedIn (48%) profile, while Research Gate (31%), Twitter (17%) and Wikipedia (10%) were supported in less extent. There was no difference in our instructors SM engagement in regard to personal, learning or teaching purposes, except for Wikipedia that was used more for personal and learning objectives, than for teaching. SM platforms most commonly used personally were Facebook (43%) and Wikipedia (26%), together with YouTube (14%), blogs (2%), and Twitter (2%). Likewise, when it comes to learning Wikipedia (21%), aside with Facebook (7%), was employed more often then blogs, YouTube and ResearchGate (each 2%). Conclusion: ETC instructors have recognized SM as a valuable educational tool throughout their preparation for trauma courses. Incorporating SM into trauma training program can boost teaching and learning productivity during continuous medical education.

%X Online self-directed learning has the potential to distribute evidence-based recommendations to a wide audience at a low cost to clinical practice guidelines (CPG) developers. An online self-learning portal was developed to support the implementation of CPGs for the urinary continence care of stroke survivors developed as part of a previous study. It includes interactive learning modules integrating evidence-based recommendations, case scenarios, learning assessments, and links to supporting information, such as assessment tools and protocols. The self-learning portal uses a Wordpress Blogging Platform which allows participants to comment on the modules and seek feedback on urinary continence care. The relative low cost of this platform might be of particular interest to health settings interested in using online self- learning tools, while limiting learning expenditures. An evaluation of the online self- learning portal concludes in February 2010. The research team partnered with national and international nursing associations to recruit nurses to participate in the evaluation. Participants were asked to complete the online self-learning portal, as well as surveys assessing baseline knowledge, post-intervention knowledge, and evaluating the online self-learning portal. This poster will provide an overview of the findings of this evaluation and discuss the implications for clinical education.

%X Introduction: A new palliative medicine consultant consortium is working across the hospice, community and acute hospital settings. We planned and delivered a train the trainers education programme in palliative care for nursing staff across community, acute trust and specialist palliative care settings. Objectives: Increase the knowledge and skills of clinical nurse specialists and community nurses who care for patients with palliative and end of life care needs. This utilised a range of teaching techniques and included opportunities for participants to teach each other. The programme was a platform for disseminating knowledge and skills widely across the community. We hope this will improve confidence and skills in palliative care and ultimately improve patient care. Methods: We developed a 2-day training course to be delivered over 4 half-days. The course is delivered by 5 consultants in palliative medicine and an associate specialist. Due to the size of our county the sessions were offered on the east and west sides to aid attendance. The topics included: difficult conversations, oncological emergencies, symptom control in non-malignancy and panel discussions. Feedback is gained from individuals and includes a Likert scale in addition to free text comments. This has led to quality improvement between the geographical sessions regarding content and delivery. Conclusion: The courses have been well attended by a total of 55 nursing staff of varying roles including district nurses, community hospital matrons, and specialist palliative care nurses from the community and acute trusts, specialist nurses from other areas including haematology, skin and acute oncology. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, examples of comments include: 'The open interaction with the palliative care medics' 'How I raise the issue of DNACPR' 'Liked that each topic had a different style' 'Sharing Experiences' We plan to continue running the teaching annually and encourage participants from the courses to join the faculty.

%X Background: Self help groups need to be organised and founded by patients themselves in Austria. In our practice we observed that many patients had many unanswered questions about thier normal daily activity months after discharge from the hospital. Patients that already suffer from heart failure were now recipients of a primary preventive ICD. All patients receive an educative booklet before discharge. These booklets do not help them deal with their anxiety of a suuden cardiac death episode or the chance of receiving a shock. We recognised the need for a support group amongst these patients and thier family. Methods:We developed a seminar program for patients and thier families. The team consists of an intensive care unit nurse, device clinic nurse and a psychologist. With the help of guest speakers on a voluntary basis we provided a seminar every 2 months . Pamphlets were printed and mailed to all ICD patients fromour clinic giving the dates and topics one year in advance. Posters and pamphlets were also sent out to community hospitals and rehab centers in the surrounding area. Results: Our program is now in its fourth year and consists of 6 yearly seminars. We have the attendees fill in an evaluation form after each seminar which includes suggestions for future topics.The program has been planned with the needs and requests from the patients and families that attend the seminars.The casual part of the seminar occurs with a visit to a local restaurant after the seminar, where the patients get to chat with each other and share experiences. Many patients that had experienced fear of the unknown have come to terms and learned to live with an ICD. Conclusion: The way to helping patients into organising a self help group is organising a platform for them to see a need for other patients to enjoy the support from other ICD carriers.The patients also have a chance to learn more about thier heart failure and how they can help themsleves through the seminars thus empowering them to make decisions for themselves.

%X Context: Online learning (referred to as e-learning throughout this article) has proved to be a useful tool for delivering accessible and convenient education to busy clinical healthcare workers. The ABS Management Company specifically designed a program to provide nurses and caregivers with the necessary knowledge and skills to improve the quality of care and the quality of life for the geriatric population in long-term care (LTC) facilities. Objectives: The purpose of the "Online Solutions: Quality Education for Quality Care in Long-Term Care" program is to use new educational pedagogies and innovative ways to conceptualise and deliver healthcare education to meet the complex issues and concerns of caregivers in LTC facilities. Methods: During the one-year period that data were collected for this study, 881 caregivers completed the eight (one-hour) modules in the program. Of these, 753 (85%) completed the optional assessment (both the pre and post tests) for one or more of the eight modules. Therefore, of the 881 employees who reviewed all eight modules (881×8 = 7048 modules), 1046 modules (15%) had both pre-post test data upon which to build the analysis. Findings: Information from the evaluation revealed learner improvement in pre-post test scores in excess of 10%, suggesting an increase in new and relevant skills and knowledge related to abuse and neglect, elopement, infection control, nutrition and hydration, pressure ulcers, provision of basic care and restraints. Moreover, the data indicated a reduction in the use of restraints and occurrence of pressure ulcers, suggesting that learners applied new knowledge and skills in the workplace. Finally, staff turnover rates decreased more than 20%, suggesting greater job satisfaction after participating in the program. Conclusions: The research findings point to an urgent and unmet need to provide more accessible just-in-time, just-for-you education programs for caregivers in LTC facilities to ensure quality and efficient services to residents and their families. © CJ MacDonald, R Walton, 2007.

%X Background/Purpose: eHealth is a broad term referring to the application of information and communication technologies in the health sector, ranging from health records to telemedicine and multiple forms of health education, support, and tools. By providing increased and anytime access to information, opportunities to exchange experiences with others, and self-management support, eHealth has been heralded as transformational, creating informed, engaged, and empowered “patients as partners,” equipped to take part in shared decision-making, and effectively self-manage chronic illness.1 The objective of our study is to examine how eHealth affects patient-provider relationships, and its ethical and practical ramifications. Methods: We interviewed healthcare professionals (HCPs) about their experiences with eHealth and its impact on the office visit. Eligible participants had a caseload with >25% of patients with arthritis and multi-morbidity, in order to address issues of managing complex chronic conditions and coordination of care. In-depth interviews used a flexible, semi-structured discussion guide, and follow-up interviews served to clarify and expand upon initial discussions. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Constant comparisons and a narrative approach guided the analyses and a relational ethics conceptual lens was applied to the data to identify emergent issues. Results: 12 HCPs (nurses, fellows, physician; 6 male, 6 female) participated. Years of practice varied from one to 29 (median = 13), and all worked in an urban or suburban setting. eHealth tools accessed most frequently were online educational resources for patients (used by all participants in some form), followed by online resources for HCPs like curated scientific summaries on diagnostic criteria, clinical therapies, and dosage calculators. HCPs generally did not see how social media could be useful to their practice. Analysis revealed 3 emergent themes: 1) HCPs shared some commonalities in how they conceptualized an ideal engaged patient as medically literate, bringing useful data to consultations, and whose evolution is largely a product of the rise of eHealth; 2) Fears of eHealth technology disrupting existing practice habits and uncertainty about liability and confidentiality issues were a barrier to the adoption of new technology; 3) Most HCPs saw eHealth tools as facilitating a shift towards a patient-provider relationship where shared decision-making is the new norm. Perceptions on the usefulness and impact of eHealth technologies varied from doubtful to enthusiastic. All declared a primary concern for best possible patient outcomes, and some saw eHealth as integral to reaching that goal. Conclusion: HCPs see eHealth technologies broadly as agents of change, for better or for worse, however, the perceived direction of that change is neither clear nor uniform given the varied experiences of this group. The value of these technologies was largely assessed through a relational ethics perspective, as the patient-provider relationship and its outcomes remained the primary concern of all HCPs.

%X The findings acquired from two focus groups (13 generalist RNs and 13 specialist RNs) which were held to evaluate compact disc interactive (CD-i) as a self-learning option for staff development were reviewed. The findings from these groups were that the CD-i platform offers educators the opportunity to design programs that meet nurses' learning needs without the need for multi-media, computers, and the associated platform training and education. This study reinforced the previously identified problem that nurses have difficulty balancing the responsibilities of providing direct patient care and the need for additional education and training and that self-study is an acceptable alternative to the traditional lecture format.

Interest and usage of the Internet as a source of information are increasing. In the future, as more nurses become comfortable with the Internet and begin to demand Internet learning opportunities, continuing education (CE) offerings will become more prevalent. This article reviews the benefits and limitations of Internet education offerings and the issues that arise in developing an Internet CE site, including the duties of a website administrator and a general overview of the cost of development and revenue generation. As speed and security improve, the Internet is becoming increasingly integrated into everyday life.

%X Nurses are increasingly encouraged to be active participants in health policy. This article provides an exemplar of how nurse practitioners (NPs) in one state, North Dakota, used strategic policy actions to obtain independent prescriptive privileges. Consistent and clear communication among NPs and with key stakeholders, including legislators, contributed to a positive policy outcome. North Dakota nurse leaders in this initiative have shared their experiences with a variety of audiences including other state boards of nursing and NP organizations in states such as New York, South Dakota, and Louisiana. In addition, a webinar sponsored by the Center to Champion Nursing in America at AARP featured several of the North Dakota NP leaders, who shared their reflections of this experience and the strategies they used. Regulatory environments and public policies will continue to significantly influence the future of all nurses. This case study of one state can be useful to NPs and other nurses seeking meaningful policy change through laws or regulations with regard to scope of practice or other health policy issues.

%X BACKGROUND: Health interventions and practices often lag behind the available research, and the need for timely translation of new health knowledge into practice is becoming increasingly important. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic search and review of the literature on online knowledge translation techniques that foster the interaction between various stakeholders and assist in the sharing of ideas and knowledge within the health field. METHODS: The search strategy included all published literature in the English language since January 2003 and used the medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (cinahl), embase and Inspec databases. RESULTS: The results of the review indicate that online strategies are diverse, yet all are applicable in facilitating online health-related knowledge translation. The method of knowledge sharing ranged from use of wikis, discussion forums, blogs, and social media to data/knowledge management tools, virtual communities of practice and conferencing technology - all of which can encourage online health communication and knowledge translation. CONCLUSIONS: Online technologies are a key facilitator of health-related knowledge translation. This review of online strategies to facilitate health-related knowledge translation can inform the development and improvement of future strategies to expedite the translation of research to practice.

%X Background: Social Media has revolutionised the way people communicate. The use of social media has now overtaken that of search engines, with a large number of internet users using this as a primary information source. This trend has lent itself to commercial companies recognising this as a far-reaching marketing tool. The medical profession has also started exploiting this trend, with students, doctors and nurses turning to social media to share knowledge and experiences as well as network in an environment where hierarchy is suspended and people interact freely as equals. There is a rapidly increasing cohort who regularly uses platforms such as Twitter to hold regular discussions, share and discuss current research and seek help from other users in difficult cases. Clinical Findings/Procedure: Interventional radiology (IR) has traditionally been a poorly understood specialty by patients and clinicians alike. We propose that as long as patient confidentiality is maintained, social media could become an invaluable tool in disseminating information about IR to patients and clinicians alike. It can also act as a forum for physicians to share experience and expertise making social media an invaluable educational tool that is not bound by geography, time or restraints of resources. Conclusion: In this educational poster, we will showcase the different ways, in which social media can be used as an educational tool as well as to disseminate information to patients and clinicians alike.

%X The nursing practical knowledge represented by nursing skill is highly tacit and is therefore difficult to verbalize. The purpose of this study is to build a new learning community for nursing education (nursing social e-learning model) that is refined and developed autonomously and continuously. We used the social network system (SNS) that can be participated in a variety of stakeholder of medical personnel in order to hear comments for the content of learning to practice nursing skill. We had the nurses make the nursing skill movie manual. Through this process to get the opinions about the movie contents from others, we inspected what kind of opinions and feelings occurred to the nurses. As a result, the nurses were able to see objectively the own nursing skills, to do self-reflection. They had the awareness to improve the nursing skills.

%X The problem-solving approach to nursing is labeled the "nursing process". It is common to use cases of simulated patients described on paper as teaching materials in order to learn nursing processes. In the present study, we developed a prototype e-learning system for improving the problem solving abilities of nursing students. The teaching materials included the following 8 nursing education categories: basic nursing; adult nursing (chronic and acute); pediatric nursing; mental health and psychiatric nursing; community health nursing (maternal and child, and geriatric); and occupational health nursing.

%X Purpose: A surgical procedure is a complex task in terms of information management inside the operating room (OR). The surgeon must collaborate with other OR actors (e.g. nurse, anaesthesiologist) and use various tools and information sources. Even if some procedures are daily performed, errors and/or oversights from the OR staff may lead to supplementary risks and costs for the patient and the institution. Analysing the surgical workflow (SWF) could help preventing such situations by live capturing issues during surgeries and, throughout subsequent procedures, alerting OR actors to pay attention so not to repeat similar issues. One of the main challenges of the surgery of tomorrow is to optimize the workflow inside the OR in regards to several risk parameters such as increased patient throughput or high turnover of OR actors (e.g. nurse students or temporary workers, surgeon in training). The purpose of this work is to develop an efficient solution for surgical workflow recording during surgery using an ontological information system, a time rescaling method and a multi-touch tablet then to demonstrate its use in clinical practice for laparoscopic surgeries. Methods: Surgical Workflows (SWF) are defined from the analysis of logical and/or temporal surgical process models (SPMs) [1]. To capture SPM during the surgery, a methodology based on our temporal rescaling (TR) method and an ontological information system (OIS) was developed [2, 3]. Generic Workflow model Our analysis of SPMs for a specific surgery (e.g. gastric bypass) leads to the computation of generic models. We use two methods to generate these models: both a simple linear model and a tree model based on simple probabilistic approach. Simple linear model (SLM) The simple linear model is a model where each step is defined in a linear sequence. This kind of model corresponds to a supervised model. It can be defined by a OR actor (e.g. a surgeon) during the planning of his surgery or come from the literature or other institution. Knowing the current step of surgery, the next step shall be the next entry in the sequence. If there is no next step, the surgery is ended. Tree model (TM): The tree model represents all the probable states of surgery using a tree for wich each node i corresponds to a probable state (i.e. step) of the surgery with a probability p(i) (cf. Fig. 1). The root node of the tree corresponds to the start of the surgery. Each child node of the root is a probable state as first step of the surgery. The first step of the surgery is set as the most probable child node of the root. This node can have children of its own. The next step is then the most probable child of the first step. The computation of the generic model is to walk along the most probable path of the tree and stop when the node is a leaf of the tree or when one child of the current node has a probability P(i) less than a defined threshold (e.g. P = 0.5). The model can be used to compute a generic SPM or used during the capture of the surgery to retrieve the next steps of a current step of surgery. (Figure Presented) Workflow capture The SPMs are captured during the surgery. The beginning of each step is determined by an OR actor (e.g. the surgeon), an observer [1] or using data mining method on OR information sources (e.g. the state of the surgical tools, trajectories of the staff) [4, 5]. This corresponds to an event captured by the main system and computed as the beginning of a new step. Each event is time stamped and then “synchronized” with the OR data using our TR method. For each step we compute the next probable state using a generic model. For the linear model the next step shall be the next step in the sequence. For the tree model the next step can be each children of the current step node with a probability p(i). All the children are sorted by decreasing probability and then proposed to the user as next steps. Implementation Before recording a new kind of surgery (e.g. gastric bypass), we define an SLM in collaboration with OR actors. This model is used to captur th first surgery. After the surgery, the model is supervised by (Figure Presented) the OR actor. Then our OIS computes a first generic model that shall be the basis of our generic tree model. For the second surgery, the TM computed is used to determine next probable steps and after the surgery a new generic model is computed. For each new SPM, a generic TM is computed and then used to capture the next SPM. During the surgery, OR actors can record a tag that can correspond to an interaction with other OR actor, or just to a note (e.g. text, vocal record) concerning a specific situation. They can also capture an unplanned step (e.g. wrong medical device prepared). The unplanned steps can be used to prevent issues during the setup (as selecting the wrong device) by informing OR actor that this specific surgical device is required instead of other ones that could be wrongly selected. Results: We first recorded ten laparoscopic surgeries using a laptop computer. The main issues with such recording devices are insufficient battery life and uncomfortable weight. We switched to a multi-touch tablet, more suited to OR environment, implementing SPM and SLM capture software on Android OS [6]. We successfully recorded one Cholecystectomy SPM using this new platform (cf. Fig. 2a). We also implemented an Android-based time client for the TR method (cf. Fig. 2b). Conclusion: We developed an efficient solution for the capture of SPM during surgery running on either a computer or a mobile device for increased usability. Theses SPM are used to generate a generic model. They are also used to capture interaction between OR staff and unplanned steps that may occur. Using this information we can now present relevant information to the OR actors and help them better manage their work during the surgery with increased safety and efficiency.

violence
%X Nurses frequently experience horizontal violence in their interactions with nursing colleagues within the workplace. By definition, horizontal violence includes such disrespectful behaviours as intimidation, coercion, bullying, criticism, exclusion or belittling. Educational programs addressing horizontal violence have been developed, but few have been evaluated with respect to knowledge acquisition and transfer. The purpose of this paper is to describe an experimental effectiveness study, using a pre/post design with a control group (total N=164). The research evaluated an innovative educational program in which nurses, using avatars, role-played strategies to address horizontal violence within a virtual nursing unit developed on the Second Life platform. The results of participating in this program were compared with more traditional educational methodologies, such as a workbook and a self-directed e-learning module. While all strategies were perceived by participants as beneficial, the findings from this study suggest that learning through the self-directed e-learning module followed with practice in a virtual world is an effective way of acquiring knowledge, skills and abilities to better address horizontal violence.

%X Problem: the oncology nursing society's (ons) website includes syntheses of research evidence for interventions for common issues impacting people with cancer (putting evidence into practice - pep) which are underutilized. Purpose: evaluate the reach and effectiveness of targeted messaging (tm) to disseminate evidence regarding cancer caregiver strain and burden. Research Methods: the sample consisted of 6614 ons members (direct patient care givers)who were randomized into a tm and control group. both groups received a cancer caregiver attitude, knowledge and behavior survey before and after distribution of 12 tms over 24 weeks to the treatment group. the tm open and click through rates and survey responses were analyzed for group and individual differences between the groups using descriptive, regression, and cluster analysis methodologies. the re-aim dissemination model was used to guide the design and analyses. Results: the pre/post test survey response rates (10.5% /9.9%) were comparable to ons electronic survey response rates. knowledge scores increased significantly in both groups (p = .001). there were no differences between control and tm groups on survey results and no clear differences based on demographic variables. of those who remembered receiving tms , post-test survey responses showed 30.1% said they visited ons web based evidence resources, and 97.8% said they used the information given sometimes or always. there was an increase in number of webpage visits from 83 to 130 to 172 visits/month from before/during/after the tm distribution. Dissemination and Implrmentation Research Impact: Health professional associations provide an excellent platform to disseminate research findings through a variety of mechanisms. This study provides information and challenges regarding the uptake and impact of email messages to targeted clinicians.

%X Background/Objectives: Many children treated for cancer are at risk for sub-fertility. The loss of reproductive potential has been described in the literature as a major Quality of Life concern for cancer survivors. Survivors report a lack of information being delivered and potential interventions being offered at diagnosis. To address this gap in care the Sick Kids Fertility Preservation Program (SKFPP) was launched in 2014. Our mandate is to provide information regarding fertility risk and fertility preservation (FP) and to provide interventions as needed. Design/Methods: Funding from the Garron Family Cancer Centre was secured for 2 years for a 1/2 time Nurse Practitioner(NP) to develop the SKFPP in conjunction with an; Oncologist, Urologist, a Gynecologist and Survivor. The success of our program was achieved by creating awareness of the need for FP information for providers and patients and developing close working relationships with stakeholders at SickKids including: Haematology and Oncology, Quality and Risk Management, IGT, Peri-Operative Services and Sinai Health Centre for Fertility and Reproductive Health. Services offered to patients with fertility risk include; counseling, sperm banking and oocyte preservation. Under the SickKids Innovation Program unproven, interventions such as ovarian and testicular tissue preservation are offered to patients at risk. We continue to develop clinical practice guidelines and policy and procedures to support the delivery of these interventions. We offer ongoing education to staff and have created tools for patient education including a website and educational materials. To describe future trends in FP and as a platform for research we have developed a Research Ethics Board approved database. Results: Since 2014, the SKFPP has consulted with over 150 patients and organized over 75 procedures. The NP role has been extended by the GFCC for 2 more years. Conclusion: Moving forward our challenge is to secure stable funding for; our program and FP interventions for our patients.

%X Background: Despite substantial efforts, effective preventive measures for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not yet available. The European Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI) has been established to improve preventive strategies for dementia/AD. Internet-based platforms are interactive tools which can facilitate implementation of preventive measures. EDPI has started the Healthy Aging Through Internet Counseling in the Elderly (HATICE) project to verify the efficacy of a multi-domain intervention based on such tool. Methods: EDPI members lead three ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (FINGER, MAPT, PreDIVA) in Finland, France and the Netherlands. In these RCTs multi-domain interventions are used to simultaneously target several vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors for dementia/ AD. Analysis of pooled data from these RCTs will serve as a basis for the design of HATICE. HATICE will enroll 4600 community-dwelling elderly people (age 65+) with multiple cardiovascular risk factors or disease, and living in Finland, France and the Netherlands. Participants will be randomly allocated to an interactive internet platform with nurse-led support to optimize pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors, or to general web-based health advice (control group). Main outcomes will be effects on dementia incidence and cardiovascular diseases. Results: HATICE started in January 2013. Datasets from FINGER, MAPTand PreDIVA are being pooled and analyzed to evaluate efficacy and feasibility of various preventive regimens based on nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions. An innovative and interactive internet platform for self-management of vascular and lifestyle- related risk factors is under development. Interactive support by nurses and patient's own physician is being integrated, as well as monitoring of adverse events. The platform will also facilitate access to internet-based cognitive training and group activities (exercise, social events). Conclusions: Through HATICE, lessons learned from existing dementia multi-domain prevention studies are being tested in a large multinational RCT, to identify effective preventive measures that can be implemented in the general population of older adults. The flexible internet-based intervention strategy can be easily translated and adapted for use in different health-care systems. It will allow for tailored interventions specifically suited to the needs of older people and careful monitoring of side effects.

%X Background: The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing & Midwifery funded a project for the development and implementation of an educational programme for staff on caring for older people with dementia in acute, residential, community care settings. Initially an audit of current programmes available nationally in dementia was carried out, followed by a comprehensive literature review to inform the development of the project. The first ever national needs analysis to identify the learning and education needs of a random sample of nurses and care attendants was carried out. As a result a suite of education programmes was developed. These included: a core generic education programme, Dementia Champion module, specialist module in responsive behaviour, e-learning course on the early identification of memory problems, Identifying Delirium Posters, Carers Handbook & CD. Methods: The generic education programme has been rolled out nationally since 2010 and evaluated in 2012. The aim of the evaluation was to identify the strengths, weaknesses and impact of the current programme, and explore suggestions for changes/revisions to the programme from all the stakeholders' perspective. The programme is currently being delivered in approximately 25 sites across Ireland. Over 2,500 health care staff across services have attended the programme to date. Twelve sites were selected for participation in the evaluation, based on geographical spread, and representation from HSE, voluntary, public and the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland. The evaluation was carried out in two stages. Postal questionnaires were sent out to selected programme co-ordinators & participants. Second stage involved telephone interviews with respondents to explore more in depth their suggestions for change. Results: The programme evaluated very positively, with facilitators and co-ordinators reporting that the content addressed all relevant areas of dementia and the information in each module providing participants with an excellent overview and a clear understanding of the subject.

%X The increasing pervasiveness of the internet and social networking globally presents new opportunities and challenges for empirical social science researchers including those in nursing. Developments in computer-mediated communication are not static and there is potential for further advances and innovation in research methods embracing this technology. The aim of this paper is to present a reflexive account and critique of the use of social media as a means of data collection in a study that sought to explore the aesthetics of clinical leadership in contemporary nursing. In doing so, comparisons are drawn from using Twitter, Facebook and e-learning announcements as methods of recruitment and subsequent data collection via an online survey. The pragmatics of the internet and online social networks as vehicles for data collection are discussed. While questions remain about best practice to safeguard the scientific integrity of these approaches and the researchers and research participants who choose to participate, the potential exists for researchers to enhance and expand research methods without compromising rigour and validity. In the interests of sharpening thinking about this means of data collection dialogue and debate are needed on a range of research aspects including but not limited to pragmatics, new requirements in research training and development, legal and ethical guidelines and strengths and limitations encountered. © 2014 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper reports the results of an online descriptive survey that sought to determine nurses' perceptions of aesthetic leadership among clinical leaders in nursing. BACKGROUND: Clinical leadership has been identified as an essential component to ensuring the delivery of safe, high-quality health care. Leadership has been increasingly linked in the literature to aesthetics. However, little consideration has been given to aesthetics in relation to clinical leadership in nursing. DESIGN: A mixed-method, online descriptive survey. METHODS: Participants were recruited via e-learning platforms and social media. A total of 66 surveys were completed, including 31 written accounts of aesthetic leadership in practice. RESULTS: Aesthetic leadership characteristics in clinical leaders most valued are support, communication and the approach taken to colleagues. Taking risks and challenging processes were least likely to be evident among effective clinical leaders. CONCLUSION: Aesthetic leadership is multi-dimensional and a style of leadership to positively influence the clinical workplace. Support, effective communication and taking into consideration the feelings of colleagues are important dimensions of aesthetic leadership. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Aesthetic leadership represents a way for clinical leaders to create and sustain a calm and positive clinical workplace.

%X Emerging changes in health-care delivery are having a significant impact on the structure of health-care professionals' education. Today it is recognized that medical knowledge doubles every 6-8 years, with new medical procedures emerging everyday. While the half-life of medical information is so short, the average physician practices 30 years and the average nurse 40 years. Continuing education thus represents an important challenge to face. Recent advances in educational technology are offering an increasing number of innovative learning tools. Among these, Virtual Reality represents a promising area with high potential of enhancing the training of health-care professionals. Virtual Reality Training can provide a rich, interactive, engaging educational context, thus supporting experiential learning-by-doing; it can, in fact, contribute to raise interest and motivation in trainees and to effectively support skills acquisition and transfer, since the learning process can be settled within an experiential framework. Current virtual training applications for health-care differ a lot as to both their technological/multimedia sophistication and to the types of skills trained, varying for example from telesurgical applications to interactive simulations of human body and brain, to virtual worlds for emergency training. Other interesting applications include the development of immersive 3D environments for training psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of mental disorders. This paper has the main aim of discussing the rationale and main benefits for the use of virtual reality in health-care education and training. Significant research and projects carried out in this field will also be presented, followed by discussion on key issues concerning current limitations and future development directions.

This program was addressed to responsible of National, Regional, Local and Hospital organizations with high activity in organ procurement and transplantation. Aims . To provide the skills required for organizing, managing and evaluating a transplant area . To promote the implementation and evaluation of quality and safety measures in order to increase the organ donation in the target area Methods and materials: The Organ Donation Quality Managers Training program was based on practical learning including a face-to-face course and a research project. The course was designed, developed and implemented in English. It provided practice simulation of donation and transplantation procurement and lasted 3 days with a total of 24 academic hours. The research project consisted in a study about organ donation quality management in the participant's Target Area that had to be approved by the participant's National authority. As materials, the program used the Transplant Coordination Manual, a course guidance focussed on the major aspects of transplant procurement management (TPM -IL3 institute Barcelona, Spain), Donor world simulation and a private virtual platform. Results 23 participants from 15 countries attended The Organ Donation Quality Managers Training program, 9 women and 14 men, among whom, 15 doctors, 5 nurses, 2 economists, 1 manager with the following specialties: transplant coordinator, director, consultant and others. Data was gathered from 20 target areas from 14 countries regarding country cadaveric donation activity, target area population, legislation, number of ICU beds pmp (per million population), brain-death and cadaveric effective donors-percentage over ICU death, procured organs per cadaveric effective donor, types of donors, transplant programs and transplanted organs, staffing and personnel, clinical functions, financial resources, organ allocation model. Summary Using the methodology, resources and organizational structure already proven by the Coordinator organization through Transplant Procurement Management action, the ETPOD project designed and implemented a European training program for donor program managers in order to increase knowledge, skills and professional performance in organ donation.

%X Professional Training on Organ Donation has been identified as one of the crucial factors to organize and improve organ donation numbers and processes. Training key professionals in their daily job, through expert training programs, establishes a better professional attitude. Aims To train key donation professionals in charge of organizing • the generation of donors and/or those due to join a Transplant Coordination Office in order to update their knowledge and reinforce their competences To promote the quick and efficient implementation of the • knowledge acquired to the own job area considering local differences Methods and materials The Professional Training on Organ Donation Program was based on blended learning considering both on-line and face-to-face training. Courses were designed, developed and implemented in English. 5 modules of specific training, posted in the ETPOD Virtual Platform, were implemented, each of them lasting 10 academic hours: Donor Detection System (DDS) • Brain Death Diagnosis (BDD) • Family Approach for Organ Donation (FAOD) • Donor Management and Organ Viability (DMOV) • Organ Retrieval Organization, Preservation and Allocation • Criteria (ORPA) The face-to-face course lasted 3 days, with 24 academic hours. It included group practices, simulations and clinical cases, mega-case -a complete practice to follow the consecutive steps leading to convert a possible donor into a real donor. As materials, Virtual Reality Game, practice training (Brain dead simulation, Organ sharing office simulation, Family approach interview simulation) and a virtual platform were used. Results Participants from 16 countries attended the virtual modules as follows: 54 participants attended the DDS module, of whom 31 participants got certified; BDD module was attended by 42 participants of whom 19 got certified. 25 participants of whom 7 got certified attended the FAOD module. 49 participants of whom 32 got certified attended DMOV. 48 participants of whom 31 got certified attended ORPA. The Professional Training on Organ Donation face-to-face course was attended by of 38 participants: 35 were medical doctors and 3 nurses: Anaesthesiology 4 Cardiology 1Intensive Care Unit 11 Nephrology 2, Neurology 2, Neurosurgery 3, Surgery 3, Registered nurse 3 and Transplant Coordination 9. The modules were scored an evaluated by participants on the different aspects of didactical elements, usefulness in the daily job, professional trainers, contents and presentation. All modules in general and elements within the modules scored positive with averages between 3.5 and 4. 7 out of 5. Summary The Professional Training on Organ Donation program came as an answer to the increasing demand of lifelong learning in the field of organ and tissue procurement and transplantation. It offered high quality courses meant to support an active and efficient system able to detect potential donors within target units. Evaluations by the different participants showed to be positive, especially in usefulness and professionalization of their daily job.

%X Under-treated pain is a significant problem. Health care institutions are under increasing pressure from patients and accreditation bodies to improve staff training in pain management. Pain assessment, a necessary pre-cursor to good pain management, is a complex multi-step process requiring sophisticated understanding and superior communication skills. This article describes the development and usability testing of an interactive, Internet-deliverable, multimedia tutorial to teach best practice pain assessment. The software platform allowed non-programmers to create multimedia tutorials and included the capability to simulate role-plays. The tutorial was designed to actively engage and respond to the learner and to include skills practice. Twenty-five nurses took the tutorial and rated it positively on a usability questionnaire in terms of ease-of-use and learning method.

%X Background: Standardized training and clinical protocols using biofeedback for the treatment of fecal incontinence (FI) are important for clinical care. Our primary aims were to develop, implement, and evaluate adherence to a standardized protocol for manometric biofeedback to treat FI. Methods: In a Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) trial, participants were enrolled from eight PFDN clinical centers across the United States. A team of clinical and equipment experts developed biofeedback software on a novel tablet computer platform for conducting standardized anorectal manometry with separate manometric biofeedback protocols for improving anorectal muscle strength, sensation, and urge resistance. The training protocol also included education on bowel function, anal sphincter exercises, and bowel diary monitoring. Study interventionists completed online training prior to attending a centralized, standardized certification course. For the certification, expert trainers assessed the ability of the interventionists to perform the protocol components for a paid volunteer who acted as a standardized patient. Postcertification, the trainers audited interventionists during trial implementation to improve protocol adherence. Key Results: Twenty-four interventionists attended the in-person training and certification, including 46% advanced practice registered nurses (11/24), 50% (12/24) physical therapists, and 4% physician assistants (1/24). Trainers performed audio audits for 88% (21/24), representing 84 audited visits. All certified interventionists met or exceeded the prespecified 80% pass rate for the audit process, with an average passing rate of 93%. Conclusions & Inferences: A biofeedback protocol can be successfully imparted to experienced pelvic floor health care providers from various disciplines. Our process promoted high adherence to a standard protocol and is applicable to many clinical settings.

%X AIM To introduce faculty to podcasting, giving them opportunities for course integration in nursing. BACKGROUND Faculty represented adult, gerontological, psychiatric, acute, and family health specialties interested in technology integration. METHOD Faculty were invited to submit an abstract describing interest and experience with educational technology and intended use of podcasting. Each faculty received an iPod® and sessions were held updating the required technical skills. Transformational learning was the conceptual framework, and faculty and students were encouraged and tutored in workshops to utilize podcast technology. Faculty launched podcasts on the university's platform, monitored students' responses, and conducted end-of-course evaluations. RESULTS Faculty enthusiastically embraced podcasting's potential. Students' responses were mixed. Many viewed podcasts as extra work and preferred face-to-face class or written assignments. Podcasts were helpful to others, especially during commutes or for reviewing or reinforcing material. Auditory learners also preferred podcasts. CONCLUSION Despite some technical difficulties, responses were positive. Using the theory of transformational learning and allowing students greater flexibility in obtaining knowledge, asynchronously, and at their own pace, proved beneficial.

%X Introduction: El Virtual Classroom (VC) from Murcia University is the official e-learning where teachers and students have various online tools that facilitate the development of teaching and learning. The VC uses SAKAI platform (Apero Foundation). Objective: To evaluate the use of VC in the Palliative Care subject of 2nd course of Grade of Nursing studies from Murcia University. Methods: During the academic year 2014-2015 we used e-learning with a VC for Palliative Care subject. Interactive learning shifts the focus from a passive, teacher-centered model of the past years to one that is active and learner-centered, offering a stronger learning stimulus The tools in the VC were: Teaching guide, calendar, resources, announcements, private messages, chats, exercises, exams online, weblogs, message boards and teleconferencing. Results: Of 205 official students in the Palliative Care subject, 99.5% visited VC. The total number of visit: 13673. In the months near to the final exam (1st July), the visits to the VC were of 3801 in May and 3951 in June. The tool more used was “Resources”: the students can work with educational materials such as lessons, text, graphics, animation, audio, or video to produce engaging content. It contained 193 archives. Of them, 98.4% were downloaded. The VC also has resolved student's doubts with the tool “Virtual tutorial” (100% were resolved). The final satisfaction survey has shown higher levels of learner satisfaction (90%), understanding of concepts, achievement of course objectives, and changes in practice. Students explained that the VC allows learning to be individualized and transforming the role of the teacher (from disseminator to facilitator). Conclusion: The integration of e-learning into education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.

%X This paper reports the findings of a research project investigating the use of iPods by student nurses to enhance their interactions with content, instructors and peers while located at a distance from their university campus. Wireless handheld devices (WHD) are an important tool in nursing environments that are undergoing rapid technological change. Preferred treatments, drug dosages, postsurgical care, and preventive healthcare regimens continually change and such devices allow students to rapidly confirm information while in the clinical area, thus fostering active learning and safe practice. A case study approach was adopted with each participating student cohort comprising a case. Multiple data collection methods were used to enable rich descriptions of each case. This paper focusses on factors, relating to the use of iPods, which influenced student learning in distance courses at two regional Queensland universities. It furthermore highlights a range of creative interventions reported by students and educators in resolving issues with their devices. The study found that connectivity difficulties, technology literacy level, compatibility of study resources with the WHDs, and small screen size were all factors that impacted negatively on the use of iPods in distance courses. The paper describes the responses of students and educators to the use of iPods for learning. This study concluded that nursing students and nursing educators alike may experience problems when WHD's are introduced to courses as a platform for learning. However, both students and educators can be innovative and resourceful in managing these problems and, when access to course resources that were enabled for viewing on the WHDs were available, the learning experience of the students and the teaching experience for the educators were enhanced.

%X INTRODUCTION: Implementation of a new electronic health record must address the needs of multiple team members and various workflows. Patient safety can be compromised if users are underprepared. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a simulation training curriculum based on pairing physicians and nurses together to learn a new electronic health record. Rapid-cycle improvement was used to identify and fix workflow issues. METHODS: Faculty and residents from obstetrics and family medicine, midwives, and nurses participated in 64 simulations over 4 weeks. Physician-nurse teams admitted, delivered, and treated a postpartum hemorrhage on a birthing simulator while documenting in the actual electronic health record. Learners completed presurveys and postsurveys regarding their satisfaction with this experience. Each session lasted 2 hours, including a 30-minute debrief. Data collection included workflow optimizations reported to the electronic health record build teams for rapid-cycle improvement. RESULTS: A total of 188 participants (faculty: 47, certified nurse- midwives: 23, residents: 31, burses: 87) completed training. The intervention was perceived as useful, created the desire to participate in more simulations, and decreased anxiety. Debrief session observations resulted in a 20-item FAQ distributed to increase uniform use of the electronic health record. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that simulation provides a useful platform for preparing a large health care team for a new electronic health record. Participants found the training useful, believed it improved understanding of workflow, and found it reduced anxiety. Workflow problems and conflicts were identified and resolved before rollout.

%X Background: There are a range of e-learning resources available to medical students at the present time, ranging from notes (either clinical or based on basic science), to clinical videos and online selfassessment (e.g. multiple choice questions). Written content is not always the most effective learning tool for all students and few websites integrate multiple resources together, that are free-toaccess. This creates a lack of continuity amongst different elearning resources. Objectives: This project seeks to address this issue by establishing an interactive website which will produce a number of resources, by utilising the increasing availability of newer technology e.g. videostreaming and podcasts. This provides the opportunity to utilise a variety of approaches to cater for a wider range of learning styles. Methodology: The following resources were implemented to achieve our objectives: 1 Producing a comprehensive set of factual notes which are applicable to the curricula of medical students throughout the UK. These focus on clinical medicine and pathophysiology of medicine. 2 They will be supplemented by podcasts covering the same material. 3 In addition to the recorded podcasts, there are also videocasts: these are video recordings of Power point slide shows, with a voice-over recoding, producing a commentary of the material. This can be likened to an on-line lecture. This is produced using CAMTASIA 7.0 software. The content is produced by 10 final year medical students from a number of different medical schools within the UK (including Cambridge University, King's College London and University College London). This allows the material to be peer-reviewed for errors. Using Joomla web design software, we were able to implement a template for the site, and each contributor could upload materials and edit them very easily. Outcomes: The main outcome measures of the project will be identifying users' perceptions of the usefulness and convenience of the website as an educational resource. The use of videocasts and podcasts to teach the same material has proved successful in different hospitals and medical centres for nurses,1,2 and this can be translated for use in medical schools. Online questionnaires can generate qualitative data about satisfaction of each individual aspect of the website. Results: This paper will present the preliminary findings of the study. Conclusion: This project has integrated a number of resources to produce a more complete e-learning source which is free to access, and provides continuity in the content if students use a variety of resources for learning.

%X Objective: Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) provide 80% of the hands-on care in US nursing homes; a significant portion of this work is performed by immigrants with limited English fluency. This study is designed to assess immigrant CNA's communication behavior in response to a series of virtual simulated care challenges. Methods: A convenience sample of 31 immigrant CNAs verbally responded to 9 care challenges embedded in an interactive computer platform. The responses were coded with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), CNA instructors rated response quality and spoken English was rated. Results: CNA communication behaviors varied across care challenges and a broad repertoire of communication was used; 69% of response content was characterized as psychosocial. Communication elements (both instrumental and psychosocial) were significant predictors of response quality for 5 of 9 scenarios. Overall these variables explained between 13% and 36% of the adjusted variance in quality ratings. Conclusion: Immigrant CNAs responded to common care challenges using a variety of communication strategies despite fluency deficits. Practice implications: Virtual simulation-based observation is a feasible, acceptable and low cost method of communication assessment with implications for supervision, training and evaluation of a para-professional workforce.

%X Method: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study by two nurses from a health center of Cartagena on 40 Primary pupils of two schools in Cartagena during 30-31 March 2015 to train teachers and students on healthy nutrition-hydration so as to assess previous and acquired knowledge by the students. Data were obtained through an open question survey about nutrition, hydration, balanced diet and healthy eating prior to a talk and various educational games (food pyramid, drawings, plasticine games.) to strengthen knowledge. In the second day of school we conducted the same survey, assessing their recently learned skills. Teachers were in charge of strengthening the information provided during the school quarter, revealing in previous surveys that were conducted in the classrooms a basic knowledge with a few trends. Results: They didn't know which foods are healthy or not and the minimum daily liquid amount required. Some children considered bakery as a must in breakfast and dinner. 95% of students improved their knowledge about nutrition. Conclusions: Educational activities should be included within existing health programs in all schools. Health education guided by healthcare professionals is better captured by the students at an early age, because is in this age is when they will shape their eating habits and lifestyles.

%X Objective: To determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adding an evidence-based internet behavioral weight loss intervention alone or combined with optional group sessions to ShapeUp Rhode Island 2011 (SURI), a 3-month statewide wellness campaign. Design: 3-arm randomized clinical trial. Setting and participants: Study participants were recruited from the Rhode Island community via employers, media, and mass mailings at the time of SURI 2011 registration. Of the 3806 participants that joined the weight loss division, 1139 were willing to be contacted for research, and the first 431 were screened for study eligibility. Exclusion criteria were minimal: age < 18 years or > 70 years, body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2, pregnant, nursing, or plans to become pregnant, a serious medical condition (eg, cancer), unreliable internet access, non-English speaking, current or previous participation in our weight loss studies, and planned relocation. Those who reported a medical condition that could interfere with safe participation (eg, diabetes) obtained doctor's consent to participate. Of those screened, 230 met inclusion criteria, completed orientation procedures, and were randomized using a 1:2:2 randomization scheme to the standard SURI program (S; n = 46); SURI plus internet behavioral weight loss intervention (SI; n = 90); or SURI plus internet behavioral weight loss intervention plus optional group sessions (SIG; n = 94). To avoid contamination, individuals on the same SURI team (see below) were randomized to the same intervention. Intervention: Participants in the standard SURI program did not receive any behavioral weight loss treatment. SURI is a self-sustaining, annual community campaign designed to help Rhode Islanders lose weight and increase their physical activity through an online, team-based competition. Participants join in teams, enter the weight loss or physical activity division or both, and compete with other teams. Throughout the 3-month program, participants have access to a reporting SURI website where they submit their weekly weight and activity data and view their personal and team progress. They also receive paper logs to record weight and activity, a pedometer, access to newsletters and community workshops, and recognition for meeting goals. Participants in the SI arm received the 3-month SURI program plus a 3-month internet behavioral weight loss intervention. Before SURI began, SI participants attended a 1-hour group meeting during which they received their weight loss goal (lose 1 to 2 pounds per week), calorie and fat gram goal (starting weight < 250 lbs: 1200-1500 kcal/day, 40-50 g of fat; starting weight ≥ 250 lbs: 1500-1800 kcal/day, 50-60 g of fat), and activity goal (gradually increase to 200 minutes of aerobic activity per week). During this session, participants were also taught self-monitoring skills and oriented to an internet behavioral weight loss intervention website developed by the authors. The intervention website included 12 weekly, 10- to 15-minute multimedia lessons based on the Diabetes Prevention Program and a self-monitoring platform where participants tracked their daily weight, calorie, and activity information. Participants received weekly automated feedback on their progress. The intervention website also included information on meal plans, prepackaged meals, and meal replacements. Participants in the SIG arm received everything in SI and were additionally given the option to attend weekly group meetings at Miriam Hospital's Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center during the 3 months. The 12 weekly, optional group sessions were led by masters-level staff with extensive training in behavioral weight loss. Sessions involved private weigh-ins and covered topics that supplemented the internet intervention (eg, recipe modification, portion control). Main outcomes measures: The main outcome was weight loss at the end of the 3-month program. Participants completed measures (ie, weight, BMI) in person at baseline and 3 months (post-treatment), and at 6- and 12-month fo low-up visits. Adherence measures included reported weight and physical activity on the SURI website (S, SI, and SIG), log ins, viewed lessons, and self-monitoring entries on the intervention website (SI, SIG), and number of groups meetings attended (SIG). To measure weight loss behaviors, the authors used the Weight Control Practices questionnaire to assess engagement in core weight loss strategies targeted in treatment, and the Paffenbarger questionnaire to assess weekly kcal expended in moderate to vigorous activity. The authors also assessed costs from the payer (labor, rent, intervention materials), participant (SURI registration fee, transportation, time spent on intervention), and societal perspective (sum of payer and participant costs) in order to calculate the cost per kg of weight lost in each study arm. Results. Participants were predominantly female, non-Hispanic white, and had a mean BMI of 34.4 kg/m2 (SE = 0.05). Groups differed only on education (P = 0.02), and attendance at post-treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-up were high (93%, 91%, and 86% respectively). The authors found that weight loss did not differ by educational attainment (P s > 0.57). Overall, there was a significant group-by-time interaction for weight loss (P < 0.001). Percentage weight loss at 3 months differed among the 3 groups-S: 1.1% ± 0.9%; SI: 4.2% ± 0.6%; SIG: 6.1% ± 0.6% (P s ≤ 0.04). There was also an overall group effect for percentage of individuals achieving 5% weight loss (P < 0.001). SI and SIG had higher percentages of participants who achieved a 5% weight loss than the control (SI: 42%; SIG: 54%; S: 7%; P s < 0.001) but did not differ from one another (P = 0.01). Initial weight losses and percentage of participants who achieved a 5% weight loss were largely maintained through the no-treatment follow-up phase at 6-months, but the 3 groups no longer differed from one another at 12 months (S: 1.2% [SE =0.9]; SI: 2.2% [SE = 0.6]; SIG: 3.3% [SE = 0.6]; P s > 0.05). All groups reported significant increases in physical activity over time (p < 0.001). More reporting of weight and physical activity data on the SURI website was associated with greater percentage weight loss (r = 0.25; P < 0.001). Number of log ins and lessons viewed on the intervention website were positively associated with percentage weight loss (r = 0.45; P ≤ 0.001; and r = 0.34; P ≤ 0.001 respectively). Greater attendance to group sessions was associated with better weight outcomes (r = 0.61; P ≤ 0.001). Younger age was associated with poorer adherence, including less reporting on the SURI website, viewing of lessons, and logging in to the weight loss website. There was a significant group-by-time effect interaction for the use of behavioral weight loss strategies (P < 0.001), and increased use of these strategies was associated with greater percentage weight loss in all 3 groups post-treatment. At 12 months, however, there were no differences between groups in the use of these strategies (P s ≤ 0.07). Cost per kg of weight loss was similar for S ($39) and SI ($35), but both were lower than SIG ($114). Conclusion: Both intervention arms (SI and SIG) achieved more weight loss at 6 months than SURI alone. Although mean weight loss was greatest with optional group sessions (SIG), the addition of the behavioral intervention website alone (SI) was the most cost-effective method to enhance weight loss. Thus, adding a novel internet behavioral weight loss intervention to a statewide community health initiative may be a cost-effective approach to improving obesity treatment outcomes.

%X Digital technology provides opportunities for using mobile learning strategies in healthcare environments. To realise the vision of the National Workforce Development Strategy there needs to be innovation of health professionals to further develop knowledge and skills of clinical supervisors to access and gain an understanding of the value of mobile learning at the workplace. The use of digital technology by clinical supervisors was explored in 2012 as part of a teaching development grant to evaluate the use of Web 2.0 technology to develop a community of practice about clinical supervision. Prior to developing the virtual network of clinical supervisors, feedback about the use of Web 2.0 technology by clinicians was sought via an online survey. Over 90% of respondents used social media, 85% understood what a blog and wiki were and approximately half of the respondents used smart phones. More than one-third indicated they would participate in a virtual community of practice and would like to receive information about clinical facilitation at least once per week. Findings indicate both inhibitors and opportunities for workforce development within healthcare environments that need to be addressed. Support of graduate-ready nurses can be achieved through an integrated outlook that enables health professionals within organisations to undertake mobile learning in situ. A flexible and collaborative approach to continuing professional development within organisations could enhance practice development and could positively impact on workforce development.

%X The quality of care of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) varies widely throughout Europe, as revealed in the Multiple Sclerosis - Nurse Empowering EDucation (MS-NEED) study, one fifth of MS nurses surveyed identified feeling that they lacked sufficient training and education to perform their day-to-day role. Complex therapy and treatment options has elicited an increase in MS nurses across Europe, with variable roles, responsibilities, knowledge and skills. There are no clear guidelines on the criteria required for the title 'MS Nurse', no consensus on a career pathway, training, education, skill level and competencies required of an MS nurse. There is a lack of parity between similar roles in different countries and inconsistent outcomes and quality of care. To this end, the European MS Platform (the umbrella organisation for 38 MS patient societies in 34 countries) developed MS Nurse PRO (www.msnursepro.org) in collaboration with the European Rehabilitation in MS (RIMS) centres network and the International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis Nurses (IOMSN). MS Nurse PRO is a foundation level resource providing a modular, online continuing medical education (CME) curriculum to support the evolving role of European MS nurses. MS Nurse PRO provides additional knowledge and skills in MS care to those outside of the specialist role who wish to expand their knowledge and provides developmental resources to those MS specialist nurses who need to succession plan. Current and planned modules include: epidemiology and pathophysiology; diagnosis and assessment; management of MS; rehabilitation nursing in MS; and patient care and support MS Nurse PRO is accredited by the UK Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Centre for Professional Accreditation and approved by the International Council of Nurses (ICN) for the award of International Continuing Nursing Education Credits (ICNECs). It is available in English and will be accessible in multiple languages throughout the course of 2014/15 including German, Italian, Spanish and Czech and will carry accreditation relevant to each country. It is endorsed by leading national and international patient and professional groups, and, as recognised in a Lancet Neurology editorial titled 'Setting new standards in multiple sclerosis care and research', MS Nurse PRO could improve care for those with MS.

%X Background: Approximately 20-30% of patients with cancer experience a clinically relevant level of emotional distress in response to disease and treatment. This in itself is alarming but it is even more problematic because it is often difficult for physicians and nurses to identify cancer patients who experience clinically relevant levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. This can result in persistent distress and can cause human suffering as well as costs for individuals and to the community.Methods: Applying a multi-disciplinary and design-oriented approach aimed at attaining new evidence-based knowledge in basic and applied psychosocial oncology, this protocol will evaluate an intervention to be implemented in clinical practice to reduce cancer patient anxiety and depression. A prospective randomized design will be used.The overarching goal of the intervention is to promote psychosocial health among patients suffering from cancer by means of self-help programmes delivered via an Internet platform. Another goal is to reduce costs for individuals and society, caused by emotional distress in response to cancer.Following screening to detect levels of patient distress, patients will be randomized to standard care or a stepped care intervention. For patients randomized to the intervention, step 1 will consist of self-help material, a chat forum where participants will be able to communicate with each other, and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section where they can ask questions and get answers from an expert. Patients in the intervention group who still report symptoms of anxiety or depression after access to step 1 will be offered step 2, which will consist of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered by a personal therapist. The primary end point of the study is patients' levels of anxiety and depression, evaluated longitudinally during and after the intervention.Discussion: There is a lack of controlled studies of the psychological and behavioral processes involved in this type of intervention for anxiety and depressive disorders. Since anxiety and depressive symptoms are relatively common in patients with cancer and the availability of adequate support efforts is limited, there is a need to develop evidence-based stepped care for patients with cancer, to be delivered via the Internet. © 2013 Mattsson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

%X A key goal of pharmacology education for clinical students (medical, pharmacy, nursing and others) is acquiring the knowledge and skills that enable them to prescribe, prepare, administer and review medicines taken by patients. These competencies are critical because medicines are the major approach to restoring and maintaining health in most healthcare systems. Working with medicines is a major part of the working day for each of these professions and also constitutes a high risk activity. The demands of this task have increased in recent years due to more drugs, more patients, older more vulnerable patients, and more complicated treatment regimens. There is now clear evidence from studies around the world that medication errors and avoidable adverse drug reactions are common and that better training could improve the situation. This session will address (i) the evidence supporting these concerns, (ii) whether changes in the style and content of undergraduate education might have contributed, (iii) what further information educators require and (iv) how the current situation might be improved by changes to the learning environment and assessments. It will look particularly at some recent developments in eLearning and eAssessments for safe medicines use.

%X Educational activities for hospital staff don't easily match with the congestive rhythm of healthcare personnel working life. Online learning could make it easier for healthcare personnel to attend courses, but there is still uncertainty about the feasibility of using distance learning to effectively meet education goals in healthcare institutions. Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri (FSM) started an online educational program, as pilot project, in October 2010. The present study hence is aimed at evaluating the impact of this initiative (in terms of extent and intensity of healthcare staff attendance; objective and subjective effectiveness) in order to take informed decisions for the future. In 15 months, 5 elearning courses have been provided to 2261 potential users of 14 FSM hospitals, in parallel with traditional education. 1099 users from all the hospital have intensively attended the courses (58% of nurses, 50% of therapists, 44%, of technicians, 25% of physicians) for a total of 27459 CME credits. Effectiveness in terms of knowledge gain is satisfactory and subjective evaluation is good (more than 95% of satisfied users). Elearning is not appropriate for all the educational needs and is not a panacea, but the reported results point out that it may be an effective and economically convenient mean to support massive educational interventions reaching results hardly attainable with traditional education. Users should be better educated about how to exploit online education at best.

%X In Italy, there is at present a certain drive in order to make e-learning for Continuous Medical Education (CME) to take off, even though a normative framework for distance CME has not been completely defined yet. This paper describes the phases of course supply and usage of an e-learning system in the occupational medicine area in Italy. The system provides 10 courses for occupational physicians and one course for nurses, physiotherapists and occupational physiotherapists. During the span of time of 11 months, 2034 users have registered to the website and 1804 of them enrolled themselves into at least one course, for a total number of 5183 course enrolments, with a mean number of course enrolments per person of about 3, and 3710 courses were successfully concluded. This study points out on one hand a wide request for this kind of educational sessions, and on the other hand good results in terms of knowledge acquisition. Since the present experimental project was aimed at contributing to the definition of the normative framework for distance education for CME, it can be expected that e-learning for CME in Italy will get off the ground in the near future. © PI-ME.

%X Large scale multiple venue institutions face problems when delivering educations to their healthcare staff. The present study is aimed at evaluating the feasibility of relying on e-learning for at least part of the training of the Salvatore Maugeri Foundation healthcare staff. The paper reports the results of the delivery of e-learning courses to the personnel during a span of time of 7 months in order to assess the attitude to online courses attendance, the proportion between administered online education and administered traditional education, the economic sustainability of the online education delivery process. 37% of the total healthcare staff have attended online courses and 46% of nurses have proved to be the very active. The ratio between total number of credits and total number of courses for online and traditional education are respectively 18268/5 and 20354/96. These results point out that eLearning is not at all a niche tool used (or usable) by a limited number of people. Economic sustainability, assessed via personnel work hour saving, has been demonstrated. When distance learning is appropriate, online education is an effective, sustainable, well accepted mean to support and promote healthcare staff's education in a large scale institution.

%X Rising health inequities, continuing nursing shortages, and overlooked professional development needs of nurse educators are three important issues facing nursing in Australia. This paper argues for an innovative and proactive strategy that could transform the nurse education workforce into one that is repopulated, reinvigorated and refocused. The problem facing nurse educators, and subsequently affecting nurses' preparation for practice and longevity in the profession, was identified by drawing on findings from the literature, extensive educational experience, and an exploratory study of nurse educators working in universities, colleges and health services. A solution has been devised by drawing together the tenets of critical social theory, transformative learning, communities of practice and social media. Nursing educators, refocused around a social justice agenda, may be the remedy that the Australian Health Care System requires to embark on effective action that can benefit everyone, from the health service staff to our most vulnerable groups in society. This refocusing can be achieved in a structured and strategic process that builds confidence and professional capabilities.

%X Background: People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. Objectives: To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. Main results: We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24-week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow-up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes-related complications, all-cause mortality, adverse events, health-related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low-quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow-up (12-month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low-quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. Authors' conclusions: Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.

%X The research literature on the use of cinema in nurse education is relatively small. This study evaluates student nurses' learning experiences of a new undergraduate elective module called Madness in the Movies. Ethical approval was granted to conduct the study. Data were collected through an online survey and a social media discussion forum. The anonymous online survey responses were collated via Survey Monkey. Content analysis was conducted on the data from the Facebook discussion threads to understand, interpret and conceptualise the meanings from the data. All study participants agreed that their understanding of mental health issues was enriched, their attitudes and beliefs enhanced and their confidence to talk about mental health concerns increased significantly. This module provides a fruitful approach to encourage critical reflection on mental health issues in a safe environment that closely mirrors authentic practice experiences. The module facilitates the development of students' knowledge, values and attitudes in relation to person-centred mental healthcare.

%X Background: National Blood Clot Alliance assessed the need to increase awareness in healthcare professionals (HCPs) about prevention, risk, and treatment of thrombosis and thrombophilia (T/T) as well as steps to create a therapeutic alliance with patients. The first tactic was production of a self-paced online curriculum with a second tactic to build on it through a series of webinars that incorporate a 5A approach to catalyze patient adherence. Objectives: Discuss T/T risk, prevention, and treatment. Enhance communication skills in HCPs to influence patient adherence. Methods: A Curriculum Development Team (CDT) was recruited from Anticoagulation Clinics (ACCs) and Hemophilia Thrombosis Centers (HTCs) that included nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physician assistants, the intended target audience. Online lessons include basics of clotting, basics of thrombophilia, anticoagulant medications, post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and prevention of venous thromboembolism, determined by needs assessment sent electronically to HCPs in ACCs and HTCs in May 2008. Its content was developed in a collaborative and reiterative process with an instructional design consultant. Objectives, content, graphics, videos, review tests, and post-tests were outlined in a storyboard. Webinar topics were based on the same needs assessment, and webinar objectives, content, and graphics were presented in PowerPoint, with team members or recruited experts as presenters. Through applying an effective and easy-to-understand 5A framework for catalyzing patient behavior change in each webinar, HCPs learn to guide a patient through the challenges of living with blood clots or clotting disorders. 5A actions include assess, advice, agree, assist, and arrange. Each webinar was presented live twice and archived on the NBCA website. Results: Evaluations show a positive response to both tactics. Conclusion: Tactics that use technology for educational outreach to promote awareness is effective.

%X Stop the Clot®: What Every Healthcare Professional Should Know is a blended online curriculum developed by National Blood Clot Alliance as part of a cooperative agreement with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Its target audience is healthcare professionals to include nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physician assistants to improve their ability to provide evidence-based care to patients with blood clots and clotting disorders. The online format is designed for self-paced learning, at any time the learner finds convenient. Content was developed under the guidance of an instructional design consultant with input from a volunteer team of subject matter experts representative of the target audience disciplines. The online content includes graphics, videos, review questions, and interactive elements, and is divided into five lessons: (1) Basics of clotting; (2) basics of thrombophilia; (3) anticoagulant medications; (4) post-thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension; and (5) Prevention of VTE. Access is instant with a click of the mouse by busy healthcare professionals, and is a no cost medium for those who want to enrich their knowledge about deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) at their work or home computer. This can place DVT and PE on the diagnostic radar of more healthcare professionals to remind or introduce them to many conditions that heighten risk, a major one being hospitalization. Individual lessons contain key “teachable” points to catalyze actionable interventions by the healthcare professional. Each learner can do all or part of the curriculum, according to self-assessed need and pace, although continuing education units are available only when the full curriculum, a post-test, and evaluation is completed. Evaluation data from those who applied for continuing education units from CDC, as well as attendance data and breakdown by healthcare discipline of those applicants will be included. There will also be a summary of a follow-up questionnaire that was created and sent by e-mail with a link on the Survey Monkey platform to all registrants at the 3 month mark to capture learning impact, retention, and application to practice.

%X Hypothesis/aims of study The MultICath study is examining ways of cleaning and storing re-usable catheters and will compare single catheter use only with mixed use (some single use and some re-use of catheters) in a trial. If mixed use is found to be safe and acceptable a change in practice will be required. Our aim was therefore to understand the determinants around catheter selection and the views of the clinicians who prescribe and teach intermittent catheterisation (IC). Study design, materials and methods A 33-question survey was developed, piloted and finally distributed using an on line platform. The questions were based on information from qualitative interviews and the responders were primarily members of the Association for Continence Advice, British Association of Urological Nurses and the Royal College of Nursing Continence Care Forum. Descriptive and thematic analyses were undertaken on closed and open-ended questions. Results Of the 206 respondents the majority were female (94%, mean age 50 years) and were primarily urology nurses (33%), continence advisors (33%) or continence service managers (10%) who had worked in the continence field for over 10 years (75%). Training was primarily in-house (36%) or sponsored by industry (44%) with 50% working in acute care and 37% in primary care. In acute care catheter availability was often limited to samples supplied by company representatives (33%) or the limited supply held in hospital pharmacies (6.7%). In the community availability could be limited by a formulary (30%) but some responders could, if a patient had particular requirements, recommend and or prescribe catheters outside the formulary (18%). Catheter prescriptions were mostly written by GPs (74%) or nurses (24%). Of the prescribing nurses, 54% had unlimited choice of catheters, while 43% were restricted in their choice. Twenty-three per cent had experience of catheter re-use with most of these agreeing that the possibility of re-usables being made more available was a good idea and something they would support. However 49% of respondents reported that they did not think it was good practice and 20% did not realise re-usable catheters were used at all in the UK, or that re0use was more common in some countries. Major concerns included the perceived increased risk of urinary tract infection and increased patient burden. Potential advantages included increased patient choice, cost savings and reducing the fear/likelihood of running out of catheters. If a mixed package was found to pose no increased risk to the patient the key facilitators in a change of practice would be inclusion in national and local guidelines, followed by clear guidance in use and cleaning and less importantly manufacturer's support with innovation and finally that availability should be as optimum as it was with single use. Interpretation of results This survey has shown that those who teach and or prescribe IC have a diversity of views about re-use of catheters for IC. Manufacturers have a role to play in training clinicians and developing and disseminating innovations in catheter design. Concluding message Should the trial show that catheter re-use does not increase either the risk to patients or unacceptable additional burden to them, it is evident that clear guidelines on catheter selection and cleaning techniques supported by recommendations in national and local guidelines will be required.

%X Program Purpose: Medical residents are demanding global health themed and international electives to promote their training and interests. The Center for Global Health and the Children's Hospital of Colorado developed a formal global health track and international elective in 2012. The clinic, in southwest Guatemala, provides experiential learning, through illness and psychosocial issues that are unique to international experiences, but not systematically learned during pediatric residency. Preliminary evaluation by rotating residents reported unique experiences and growth in diagnostic skills, treatment options and interpersonal communication; but also revealed a lack of preparedness and resources for these unique clinical situations. Current research supports pre-rotation education, competency-focused goals and debriefing as important factors to successful global health electives. This program intends to create a full elective curriculum, designed to address specific competencies using entrustable professional activities. Structure and Methods: This is a group effort with residents in the global health track, the fellow and faculty. The American Academy of Pediatrics and additional organizations have developed competencies for global heath education, from which we are customizing to our elective. Entrustable professional activities are also forming the framework for developing an online, downloadable, platform with text and video material, assigned reflections as well as teaching presentations for the pediatric residency program and the clinic nurses. This platform will complement and enhance the clinical experience. Outcome and Evaluation: Post elective debrief and surveys alongside formal evaluations facilitate assessment and improvement of the curriculum. To date, there is an outline of curriculum, including competencies and entrustable professional activities, with topics currently being curated into text and video. The team is working with the medical education department within the residency program as well. Going Forward: The team is working to create content and evaluations to assess progress. The curriculum will be made available to rotating residents as it is created. The elective will become more robust and this curriculum may be adapted for use by international rotations at additional institutions.

%X Recognition needs to be given to emerging postgraduate nursing students' status of 'consumer', and the challenge for nurse education is to remain relevant and competitive in a consumer-led market. An e-learning model has been suggested as a competitive and contemporary way forward for student consumers, but successful introduction of this requires leadership and strong organisational management systems. This article applies the NHS leadership framework to nurse education in relation to implementation of e-learning and describes and interprets each element for application in higher education settings. By applying a leadership framework that acknowledges the skills and abilities of staff and encourages the formation of collaborative partnerships in the wider university community, educators can begin to develop skills and confidence in teaching using e-learning resources. © 2014 RCN Publishing Ltd.

%X Background: The NIHSS is used for the initial assessment of patients with acute stroke for hospitals seeking Primary Stroke Center certification by The Joint Commission. There is a gap between online education and performance at the bedside. By implementing face-to-face instruction, scenario based return competency and remediation, we can we can narrow the gap between e-learning and application Methods: In a rural hospital pursuing Primary Stroke Center certification, nurses from the ED, ICU, Medical-Surgical, and the Float Pool were required to complete NIHSS training within 6 weeks. The training was divided into multiple phases. During the first phase, the nurses completed the online NIHSS certification appropriate for their respective group to complete. In addition to the mandatory online certification course, face-to-face instruction was offered to supplement the online training. In the second phase, the nurses' competency was evaluated in a simulated scenario. The third phase was reserved for the nurses that failed the competency evaluation. They were required to receive face-to-face instruction as a remedial measure and repeat the competency evaluation. All nurses received the training from the same two nursing educators with a critical care background Results: Of the 114 nurses that completed the first two phases of training 36 (32%) failed the competency in phase two. The total of failure per specialty in the overall group that failed: Med-Surg 19 (53%), ICU 10 (28%), ED 5 (14%), and Float Pool 2 (0.06%). Eight (89%) of nurses that voluntarily completed the face-to-face instruction in phase one passed the evaluation in phase two. In the third phase, 36 (100%) nurses that received remedial face-to-face instruction passed the repeat competency evaluation. Failure rate according to level of group certification was NIHSS Group A 35 (97%) and Group B 1 (0.03%) Discussion: Face-to-face instruction clearly enhances stroke assessment. Every nurse (n=36) passed the competency evaluation after receiving remedial face-to-face instruction, and of those nurses who opted to supplement their online training with face-to-face instruction before their initial competency evaluation, 8 (89%) passed.

%X BACKGROUND: Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) bring together gametes outside of the body to enhance the probability of fertilisation and pregnancy. Advanced sperm selection techniques are increasingly being employed in ART, most commonly in cycles utilising ICSI. Advanced sperm selection techniques are thought to improve the chance that structurally intact and mature sperm with high DNA integrity are selected for fertilisation. Advanced sperm selection strategies include selection according to surface charge; sperm apoptosis; sperm birefringence; ability to bind to hyaluronic acid; and sperm morphology under ultra-high magnification. These techniques theoretically improve ART outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of advanced sperm selection techniques on ART outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: Systematic search of electronic databases (Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS)), trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), conference abstracts (Web of Knowledge) and grey literature (OpenGrey) for relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the reference lists of included studies and similar reviews. The search was conducted in May 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an advanced sperm selection technique versus standard IVF or ICSI or versus another advanced sperm selection technique. We excluded studies of sperm selection using ultra-high magnification (intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection, or IMSI), as they are the subject of a separate Cochrane review. Quasi-randomised and pseudo-randomised trials were excluded. Our primary outcome measure was live birth rate per woman randomly assigned. Secondary outcome measures included clinical pregnancy per woman randomly assigned, miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and fetal abnormality per clinical pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of studies and risk of bias, and performed data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third review author. Study investigators were consulted to resolve other queries that arose. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We planned to combine studies using a fixed-effect model, if sufficient data were available. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs were included in the review. Both evaluated sperm selection by hyaluronanic acid binding for ICSI, but only one reported live births. No studies were identified that were related to surface charge selection, sperm apoptosis or sperm birefringence.One RCT compared hyaluronanic acid binding versus conventional ICSI. Live birth was not reported. Evidence was insufficient to show whether there was a difference between groups in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.22, one RCT, 482 women). This evidence was deemed to be of low quality, mainly as the result of poor reporting of methods and findings. Miscarriage data were unclear, and fetal abnormality rates were not reported.The other RCT compared two different hyaluronanic acid binding techniques, SpermSlow and physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection (PISCI). Evidence was insufficient to indicate whether there was a difference between groups in rates of live birth (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05, one RCT, 99 women), clinical pregnancy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.71, one RCT, 99 women) or miscarriage (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.44, one RCT, 41 women). The evidence for these comparisons was deemed to be of low quality, as it was limited by imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. Fetal abnormality rates were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to determine whether sperm selected by hyaluronanic acid binding improve live birth or pregnancy outcomes in ART, and no clear data on adverse effects were available. Evidence was also insufficient to show whether there is a difference in efficacy between the hyaluronic acid binding methods SpermSlow and PICSI. No randomised evidence evaluating sperm selection by sperm apoptosis, sperm birefringence or surface charge was found.Further studies of suitable quality are required to evaluate whether any of these advanced sperm selection techniques can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

%X AIMS: This paper discusses the methodological challenges of using the 3D social virtual world Second Life for research and offers some solutions on a range of research issues including research ethics committee approval, gaining consent, recruitment of sample, data collection and engagement with 'in - world culture'. BACKGROUND: The attraction of social virtual worlds to researchers is their ability to mimic the physical world, as they, are seen as 'places' where people have a feeling of presence (being there) and social presence (being there with others) through the use of a 'customisable' avatar (digital self-representation). Emerging research demonstrating the persuasive nature of avatars on health behaviours through virtual worlds, online games and the 3D web has increased the use of and interest in these areas for delivering health information, advice and support. However, conducting research can be challenging in a 3D world where people are represented as anonymous avatars in an environment unlike any other online media. DATA SOURCES: 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted in Second Life from September 2011-June 2012. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses wishing to undertake research in social virtual worlds should spend time in-world to acquire technical skills and gain an understanding of the culture of the world. CONCLUSION: Our experience of an interview-based study in virtual worlds indicates that researchers require several virtual world technical skills to create innovative tools to recruit, gain consent and collect data and an understanding of in-world culture, language and social norms to increase the chances of successful research.

%X Social media (SoMe) is gaining popularity as a platform for informal, user-directed learning; the ease with which educational material and discussion can be accessed from multiple devices is key to this. We aimed to develop a haematology-oriented presence within SoMe to promote educational dialogue and haematology as a specialty. We chose Twitter, a free, widely used SoMe microblogging website as it allows instant dissemination and discussion of educational material. Our Twitter profile (@TeamHaem) contains a short biography of who we are and our objectives. @TeamHaem established a Twitter presence by 'following' education and medical professionals, enabling us to see their status updates. We subsequently asked them to 'tweet' about us; therefore gaining our own followers. We created case-led discussions, which evolve over time and are designed to be topical and relevant to our followers, targeting their various skill sets and levels of expertise. We used the website Wordpress to create the backbone of our case and Twitter to lead the discussion. Images, such as blood films, can be posted in addition to links from journal articles. Any follower can contribute or can simply watch the case developing. We react to followers' suggestions and encourage evidence-based discussion, closing each case with a summary. We moderate discussion and explicitly refrain from offering medical advice. Technological literacy, compliance with confidentiality and SoMe guidelines, time management and promotion of the service to non- Twitter users have all provided challenges. These obstacles have been overcome by following General Medical Council guidelines, seeking advice from senior colleagues, presenting at local meetings and publishing in trainee newsletters. @TeamHaem has been operational since 2012 and we currently have 555 followers around the world, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and biomedical scientists. We have published 17 cases so far. As our community grows and develops so will the strength of discussion and debate.

%X BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy simulators that enable one to perform computer-based virtual colonoscopy now exist. However, data regarding the effectiveness of this virtual training are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether virtual reality simulator training translates into improved patient-based colonoscopy performance. METHODS: The present study was a prospective controlled trial involving 18 residents between postgraduate years 2 and 4 with no previous colonoscopy experience. These residents were assigned to receive 16 h of virtual reality simulator training or no training. Both groups were evaluated on their first five patient-based colonoscopies. The primary outcome was the number of proctor 'assists' required per colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes included insertion time, depth of insertion, cecal intubation rate, proctor- and nurse-rated competence, and patient-rated pain. RESULTS: The simulator group required significantly fewer proctor assists than the control group (1.94 versus 3.43; P≤0.001), inserted the colonoscope further unassisted (43 cm versus 24 cm; P=0.003) and there was a trend to intubate the cecum more often (26% versus 10%; P=0.06). The simulator group received higher ratings of competence from both the proctors (2.28 versus 1.88 of 5; P=0.02) and the endoscopy nurses (2.56 versus 2.05 of 5; P=0.001). There were no significant differences in proctor-, nurse- or patient-rated pain, or attention to discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-based colonoscopy simulation in the initial stages of training improved novice trainees' patient-based colonoscopy performance. ©2014 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Aims: The advancement of computer technology has led to the development of several virtual reality colonoscopy simulators. The potential benefits as a training tool include the ability to do an unlimited number of procedures with no risk of procedural related complications. Our aim in this study is to determine whether virtual reality simulator training translates into improved patient based colonoscopy performance. Methods: We enrolled 18 residents between PGY2 and PGY4 with no prior colonoscopy experience. They were assigned to be in either the simulator trained group (n = 10) or the non-simulator trained control group (n=8). The simulator group completed an average of 16 hours (range 12 - 20) on the Simbionix GI Mentor II colonoscopy simulator prior to patient based colonoscopy. We then evaluated both groups on their first 5 patient based colonoscopies, giving the residents a 15 minute time limit to reach the cecum. Objective: Outcome measures included the insertion time, depth of insertion and the number of assists required. Preset criteria for assisting fellows included making no forward progress with the scope over a period of 2 minutes. Subjective outcome measures included ratings of pain, attention to discomfort, and technique by the proctor, endoscopy nurse, and patient on a 5 point Likert scale. Results: Within the allotted time, the average distance reached was the hepatic flexure by the simulator group and the transverse colon by the controls (p=0.09). The simulator group required significantly less assists than the control group (1.94 vs. 3.43, p=<0.001), inserted the scope further unassisted (43cm vs. 24cm, p=0.003), and there was a trend to reach the cecum more often (26% vs. 10%, p=0.06). The simulator group received higher ratings of competence by both the proctors (2.28 vs. 1.88 out of 5, p=0.02) and the endoscopy nurses (2.56 vs. 2.05 out of 5, p=0.001). There were no significant differences in proctor, nurse or patient rated pain or attention to discomfort. Conclusions: In the initial stages of training, patient based colonoscopy performance is superior in simulator trained residents compared to non-simulator trained residents. The residents completing simulator training were all highly satisfied with the experience and this study indicates that at least 16 hours of training may be required for optimal benefit. As well, the method of providing “assists” to residents for challenging parts of the colonoscopy and returning the scope to them worked extremely well. Employing this technique, allowed the novice residents to perform successful and efficient colonoscopies with a high degree of patient satisfaction.

%X Background About 1 in 7 of all hospitalized patients is readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The cost of readmissions is signifcant, with Medicare readmissions alone costing the health care system an estimated $28 billion a year. Objective To identify the rates of and causes for readmission within 100 days of patients receiving a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Methods We performed a retrospective review of 235 consecutive transplant recipients (autologous, n = 144; allogeneic, n = 91) to determine rates and causes for readmission within 100 days of patients receiving a transplant. Medical records and hospital readmissions were reviewed for each patient. Results 36 allogeneic patients accounted for 56 readmissions. 23 autologous patients accounted for 26 readmissions. Autologous transplant recipients were most commonly readmitted for the development of a fever (n = 15 patients) or cardiopulmonary issues (n = 4). The most prevalent reasons for readmission in the allogeneic recipients included a fever (n = 21) or the development or exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease (n = 5). The readmission length of stay was 6 days (median range, 1-91 days) for allogeneic patients and 4 days (median range, 1-22 days) for autologous patients. There was no difference in survival between the readmitted and the non-readmitted cohorts (P = .55 for allogeneic patients; P = .24 for autologous patients). Although allogeneic graft recipients demonstrated a higher readmission rate (39.6%) compared with autologous recipients (16%), none of the variables examined, including age, gender, performance status, diagnosis, remission status at the time of transplant, comorbidities, type of preparative chemotherapy regimen or donor type, identifed patients at increased risk for readmission. Limitations Variations in clinical care, physician practices, and patient characteristics need to be considered when examining readmission rates. Most of the allogeneic patient population included unrelated donor recipients (65%) who received nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens (81% of allogeneic recipients). These features may not be characteristic of other centers. Conclusions In these high-risk patients, readmissions following a transplant are common. Enhanced predischarge education by nurses and pharmacists, along with ongoing outpatient education and rigorous outpatient follow-up through phone calls or social media may decrease readmission rates.

%X Introduction: There is a lack of published data on HHOs/patient/day across countries. While HH compliance rates are often published based on observations by auditors, some recognised disadvantages are training required, valuable hours taken to collect representative samples and the Hawthorne effect. Emerging technologies have potential to improve data reliability, timeliness and density. A key challenge is to establish an accepted “denominator” (HHOs) in the compliance equation. Objectives: Our aim was to establish the average HHOs/patient/day in a variety of acute care facilities in Australia, Netherlands and United Kingdom based on the WHO 5 Moments for HH recommendations. Methods: Australia: 24-hr expert observations of HHOs were made in 2 wards for 7 days. HHOs/patient/day were averaged for both wards, tested for difference and aggregated. Aggregated average HHOs/patient/day were adjusted for care level using patient:nurse ratio and weighted for auditor bias. Netherlands: Case patients were followed for 7 days to directly observe HHOs/patient/day. Data were tested for difference and averaged. UK: Commonly performed care scenarios, “virtual patient/HCW observations”, were gathered from a range of wards in 3 hospitals and aggregated into typical care-days representative of patient type by care level to generate HHOs/patient/day. Selected expert observations were completed to validate results. Average HHOs established from a USA study were then compared against the results from the 3 countries. Results: In all 3 countries average HHOs/patient/day were in the range 50-85. Patient:nurse ratios in all 3 countries fell in the range 3-5. All results compared closely with the USA study findings. Conclusion: Our work indicates that in acute care facilities in the 3 countries studied and USA, HHOs/patient/day is similar and driven by the prevailing similar patient:nurse ratio as a universal indicator of patient care level. This novel information provides valuable insight and allows emerging technologies that use HHOs as a denominator in a compliance equation to be considered for use in different developed countries where facilities and practices are similar.

%X BACKGROUND: Problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely adopted in medical education. Learners become bored with paper-based cases as they progress through their studies. AIM: To breathe life (i.e. develop virtual patients) into paper-based PBL cases. METHODS: The "patients" in paper-based PBL cases in one Year 2 were transformed into virtual patients by simulated patients role-playing and the videos and associated patient data uploaded to Bond's Virtual Hospital, a mobile Application. In unsupervised "clinical teams", second-year students undertook "ward rounds" twice a week, prompted by a virtual consultant and registered nurse. Immediately following the "ward rounds", they met with a clinician facilitator to discuss their "patients". RESULTS: Apart from some minor technical issues, the experience was rated positively by students and clinical facilitators. They claimed that it provided students with a sense of what happens in the real world of medicine. The group work skills students had developed during PBL stood them in good stead to self-manage their "clinical teams". CONCLUSIONS: This more authentic PBL experience will be extended to earlier semesters as well as later in the curriculum as the virtual hospital can be used to expose learners to a profile of patients that may not be guaranteed during hospital rounds.

%X Objective: Nurses need to be competent and confident in performing drug calculations to ensure patient safety. The purpose of this study is to compare an interactive e-drug calculations package, developed using Cognitive Load Theory as its theoretical framework, with traditional handout learning support on nursing students' drug calculation ability, self-efficacy and support material satisfaction. Design: A cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the e-package with traditional handout learning support was conducted with a September cohort (n= 137) and a February cohort (n= 92) of second year diploma nursing students. Students from each cohort were geographically dispersed over 3 or 4 independent sites. Measurements: Students from each cohort were invited to participate, halfway through their second year, before and after a 12 week clinical practice placement. During their placement the intervention group received the e-drug calculations package while the control group received traditional 'handout' support material. Drug calculation ability and self-efficacy tests were given to the participants pre- and post-intervention. Participants were given the support material satisfaction scale post-intervention. Results: Students in both cohorts randomised to e-learning were more able to perform drug calculations than those receiving the handout (September: mean 48.4% versus 34.7%, p= 0.027; February: mean 47.6% versus 38.3%, p= 0.024). February cohort students using the e-package were more confident in performing drug calculations than those students using handouts (self-efficacy mean 56.7% versus 45.8%, p= 0.022). There was no difference in improved self-efficacy between intervention and control for students in the September cohort. Students who used the package were more satisfied with its use than the students who used the handout (mean 29.6 versus 26.5, p= 0.001), particularly with regard to the package enhancing their learning (p= 0.023), being an effective way to learn (p= 0.005), providing practice and feedback (p< 0.001), being accessible (p= 0.027), user friendly (p= 0.02) and providing learning enjoyment (p= 0.022). Conclusion: It is essential that nurses are educated and supported to become, and remain, confident and competent in performing drug calculations. This study found the e-drug calculations package, based on Cognitive Load Theory, to be significantly more effective than a handout in improving students' drug calculation ability and self-efficacy, with students who used the package being significantly more satisfied with its use than students who used the handout. This package could particularly be useful for the continuing professional development of any healthcare professional involved in drug calculations. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X The relationship between nursing education and nursing practice has been the topic of discussion throughout the history of the profession. The rate of change at the turn of this new century is unfolding more rapidly than ever. In this article the London underground is used as a metaphor to examine transition issues related to nursing education and care delivery. Commuters entering the underground are met with signs and announcements warning travelers to "mind the gap" (the gap is the opening between the train and the platform). The purpose of the underground is to safely transport people from one destination to another. One wrong step and travelers can find themselves in a potentially fatal situation.

%X The objectives of this survey were to: 1) understand current peripheral IV stabilization practices within our hospital and 2) evaluate the use of a new closed IV catheter system with a built-in stabilization platform. All medical-surgical patients within an 851-bed acute care hospital with peripheral-short catheters were evaluated within a 3-day period for catheter securement, dwell time, and signs of complications. Additionally, catheter restart data were collected from a renal telemetry unit for 2 weeks. Catheter and dressing protocols were then standardized to a new catheter system with a built-in stabilization platform (Nexiva™ Closed Catheter System) and an absorbent transparent dressing (SorbaView® 2000). After a 2-week trial of the new protocol, catheters were again evaluated for securement and restart data were again collected from the renal telemetry unit. Staff nurse (N = 42) opinions on the new catheter system and dressing combination were sought, as well as a vote on willingness to change to the new catheter system and dressing. Results demonstrate improvement in catheter stabilization (out to 96 hours of dwell-time), decreased restarts, a high clinical preference for the new catheter/dressing system, and a high willingness to convert to the new system. Results indicate that the new closed IV catheter system with a built-in stabilization platform and the transparent absorbent dressing evaluated in this survey may help to improve catheter securement and increase dwell-time. Research studies utilizing more rigorous randomized, controlled comparisons are warranted.

%X Relevance: The abstract relates to the congress themes of: • practice in a digital age • public health. Purpose: Suicide prevention is an area of significant global public health need. Over 800,000 people around the world die due to suicide every year (WHO, 2014), and it is the leading cause of death for men aged 15 to 49 in England. In 2014 a quarter of people in England who took their own life had been in contact with a health professional in the week before they died (NHS England, 2016). The World Health Organisation made suicide prevention an international public health priority in 2014. However stigma around suicide remains widespread. Two multi-professional tweet chats were held in 2014 and 2015 to support World Suicide Prevention Day. The aims were to tackle stigma and misconceptions around suicide and highlight relevance for allied health professionals (AHPs). The objectives of the tweet chats were to bring together a diverse range of people to discuss suicide prevention, explore understanding of suicide prevention approaches, signpost to sources of education and support, and discuss this topic in a responsible and compassionate way. Approach/evaluation: A tweet chat is a structured, hosted discussion on twitter, planned in advance and held at an arranged time on a pre-determined topic. Web-based prechat information was published in advance for participants outlining areas of discussion and sources of information and support, and was promoted through Twitter and Facebook. The tweet chats were facilitated by a team of healthcare professionals, including 2 physiotherapists and a psychiatrist, and covered identification of, and support for, people at risk of suicide. Pre-chat information signposted to crisis support and guidance on language to use when talking about suicide. Advice on the emotional aspects of the discussion was provided before, during and after the tweet chats. Representatives from mental health charities monitored the tweet chats for anyone showing signs of distress, with immediate support available offline if needed. Outcomes: 84 participants took part in the 2014 tweetchat, and 45 in 2015. Both tweet chats were joined by members of the public, nurses, physiotherapists, AHPs, and pharmacists. No crisis support services were required for participants during or immediately after either tweetchat, and a range of perspectives and experience were shared. Discussion and conclusions: The tweet chats brought together a range of people to discuss suicide prevention in a safe, sensitive and compassionate way. Themes covered during the discussions included people at risk, duty of care, asking the right questions, compassion, and access to suicide prevention training. Some physiotherapists taking part reported that they lacked confidence in suicide prevention approaches. This may reflect that suicide prevention has received limited attention to date in physiotherapy public health strategies and education. It is planned that a similar tweet chat in 2016 will result in a formal briefing paper for AHP professional bodies in the United Kingdom and internationally. Impact and implications: Sensitive topics such as suicide and suicide prevention can be discussed responsibly by healthcare professionals during a tweet chat when planned carefully, with skilled facilitation, and supported by professional guidance on the use of social media.

%X Wessex NHS and Portsmouth Hospitals Trust are engaging and facilitating junior doctors, with junior doctor led improvement projects. A review of elective orthopaedic patients in Surgical High Care (SHC) at Royal Hospital Haslar (RHH), together with informal surveys of medical, surgical and nursing teams identified recognition of medical disease, diagnostic speed, and management as contributory factors in medical cause admissions. Our challenge was improving medical knowledge in a novel fashion because EWT compliant rotas drastically reduce teaching opportunities. Junior surgical staff were surveyed for solutions and an interactive e-mail based set of cases and multiple-choice questionnaires developed. These allowed medical learning, case based discussions, and practice towards surgical examinations. The e-cases were sent 4 weekly, and juniors asked to return answers. Answers and discussion were provided a week later. A twice daily handover allowed reinforcement of teaching and individual discussions. The medical and surgical teams were re-surveyed after 4 cases. SHC admission cases were audited. All 14 juniors confirmed receipt, thirteen reporting no formal teaching on these topics prior to the e-cases, and all 14 were positive about the cases. The five RMOs all reported improvement over 4 months. The percentage of medical cases admitted fell by 2% over the same period, all cause referral rose 33%. Flexible interactive e-teaching can complement medical education, it can be delivered at times suiting the individual, the material can be relevant to routine practice, the uptake of cases can be measured, and compliance with education can be supported by material that helps in higher professional exams. This is likely to improve the quality of health outcome but now needs formal testing. Cross faculty and speciality co-operation and teaching has the potential to significantly improve doctor knowledge and routine medical care in surgical patients. E- based learning can help timetabling difficulties associated with modern hospital practice.

%X To develop a teaching and learning environment, on-line and free, to provide technical information with health professional team from Epidemiological Health Surveillance and Nosocomial Infection Control Groups in Brazil. The first Brazilian experience of e-learning was carried out through a partnership between the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The course supported by different approaches: internet, telephone, books and CD (compact disk). The course had five topics: legislation, epidemiological surveillance, investigation of outbreaks and prevention of infections, occupational risk and isolation, with 20 days each topic and 250 h. Each topic finished with an evaluation and one classroom course. The student's number was 236, with 188 selected, 97.7% enrolled in the course and with 3% of non-approval. The students characteristics were: mean age 41.9 years, female gender majority 84.50 and 54.3% nursing, 15.9% physicians and 10.4% pharmacists. In Brazil, with difficulties to have access to knowledge opportunities, HAI's course would be an alternative to teach about infection control. © 2008 Science Publications.

%X BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating condition affecting more than 350 million people worldwide (WHO 2012) with a limited number of evidence-based treatments. Drug treatments may be inappropriate due to side effects and cost, and not everyone can use talking therapies.There is a need for evidence-based treatments that can be applied across cultures and with people who find it difficult to verbally articulate thoughts and feelings. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is used with people from a range of cultural and intellectual backgrounds, but effectiveness remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of DMT for depression with or without standard care, compared to no treatment or standard care alone, psychological therapies, drug treatment, or other physical interventions. Also, to compare the effectiveness of different DMT approaches. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) and CINAHL were searched (to 2 Oct 2014) together with the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The review authors also searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Dissertation Abstracts (to August 2013), handsearched bibliographies, contacted professional associations, educational programmes and dance therapy experts worldwide. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying outcomes for people of any age with depression as defined by the trialist, with at least one group being DMT. DMT was defined as: participatory dance movement with clear psychotherapeutic intent, facilitated by an individual with a level of training that could be reasonably expected within the country in which the trial was conducted. For example, in the USA this would either be a trainee, or qualified and credentialed by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In the UK, the therapist would either be in training with, or accredited by, the Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy (ADMP, UK). Similar professional bodies exist in Europe, but in some countries (e.g. China) where the profession is in development, a lower level of qualification would mirror the situation some decades previously in the USA or UK. Hence, the review authors accepted a relevant professional qualification (e.g. nursing or psychodynamic therapies) plus a clear description of the treatment that would indicate its adherence to published guidelines including Levy 1992, ADMP UK 2015, Meekums 2002, and Karkou 2006. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study methodological quality was evaluated and data were extracted independently by the first two review authors using a data extraction form, the third author acting as an arbitrator. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies totalling 147 participants (107 adults and 40 adolescents) met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-four participants took part in DMT treatment, while 73 comprised the control groups. Two studies included male and female adults with depression. One of these studies included outpatient participants; the other study was conducted with inpatients at an urban hospital. The third study reported findings with female adolescents in a middle-school setting. All included studies collected continuous data using two different depression measures: the clinician-completed Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) (self-rating scale).Statistical heterogeneity was identified between the three studies. There was no reliable effect of DMT on depression (SMD -0.67 95% CI -1.40 to 0.05; very low quality evidence). A planned subgroup analysis indicated a positive effect in adults, across two studies, 107 participants, but this failed to meet clinical significance (SMD -7.33 95% CI -9.92 to -4.73).One adult study reported drop-out rates, found to be non-significant with an odds ratio of 1.82 [95% CI 0.35 to 9.45]; low quality evidence. One study measured social functioning, demonstrating a large positive effect (MD -6.80 95 % CI -11.44 to -2.16; very low quality evidence), but this result was imprecise. One study showed no effect in either direction for quality of life (0.30 95% CI -0.60 to 1.20; low quality evidence) or self esteem (1.70 95% CI -2.36 to 5.76; low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The low-quality evidence from three small trials with 147 participants does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of DMT for depression. Larger trials of high methodological quality are needed to assess DMT for depression, with economic analyses and acceptability measures and for all age groups.

%X Background and purpose: Teledermatology means specialized skin care (diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) using information technology and telecommunications. This system facilitates communication between patients, doctors, nurses and primary care providers with dermatologists. The purpose of this study was to design and build a software for remote diagnosis of skin diseases. Materials and methods: In the first phase of study, based upon a literature review, a questionnaire was designed to determine the items needed for software design and was completed by dermatologists in Razi Hospital. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS V.19. In next phase, according to the results of first phase, the prototype was designed and Think Aloud usability test was applied. Then, the final version of the software was designed. Results: In the section of patient's identity, the respondents listed all data elements except the National Identification Number, address, and weight. They also suggested patient's job as an essential item. All items for clinical data and functionality of the software were found necessary. Considering the results obtained from the questionnaires and usability test, the final version of the web-based store and forward software was created. Conclusion: This kind of platform could help dermatologists in providing rapid diagnosis and treatment plan for each patient since it enables electronic transmission of patient images and clinical history. Also, this system requires limited technical equipment and is cheap to run which could be applied with little training to nurses or referral physicians.

%X Traditional teaching methods used in medical education couldn't meet the need for keeping pace with up to date information. Present study has conducted in order to compare the effect of lecture and e-learning methods on nursing students' learning outcomes in the context of Iran. A cross-over design was applied. Study sample was consisted of 32 students which were in third semester of nursing bachelor program and were passing Maternal Child nursing course. The first part of the course was taught using lecture method during first four weeks; an e-learning method was the technique used to educate the remained part of the course during the second four weeks. Students' learning outcomes in each method, opinion toward and participation with both educational methods was assessed. No significant difference was found between students exam scores in both methods. Considering students' opinion toward educational methods, no significant difference was found between two methods in general but students reported better "capability" and "independency" in e-learning method while lecture was obtained higher scores in "effectiveness on learning" and "motivation" characteristics. E-learning can be used in teaching some nursing courses. It is recommended to use e-learning method with appropriate interactive strategies and attractive virtual environments to motivate students.

%X Objectives: OMARC, a multimedia application designed to support the training of health care providers for the identification of common lung sounds heard in a patient's thorax as part of a health assessment, is described and its positive contribution to user learning is assessed. The main goal of OMARC is to effectively help health-care students become familiar with lung sounds as part of the assessment of respiratory conditions. In addition, the application must be easy to use and accessible to students and practitioners over the internet. System description: OMARC was developed using an online platform to facilitate access to users in remote locations. OMARC's unique contribution as an educational software tool is that it presents a narrative about normal and abnormal lung sounds using interactive multimedia and sample case studies designed by professional health-care providers and educators. Its interface consists of two distinct components: a sounds glossary and a rich multimedia interface which presents clinical case studies and provides access to lung sounds placed on a model of a human torso. OMARC's contents can be extended through the addition of sounds and case studies designed by health-care educators and professionals. Validation and results: To validate OMARC and determine its efficacy in improving learning and capture user perceptions about it, we performed a pilot study with ten nursing students. Participants' performance was measured through an evaluation of their ability to identify several normal and adventitious/abnormal sounds prior and after exposure to OMARC. Results indicate that participants are able to better identify different lung sounds, going from an average of 63% (S.D. 18.3%) in the pre-test evaluation to an average of 90% (S.D. of 11.5%) after practising with OMARC. Furthermore, participants indicated in a user satisfaction questionnaire that they found the application helpful, easy to use and that they would recommend it to other persons in their field. Conclusions: OMARC is an online multimedia application for training health care students in the assessment of respiratory conditions. The software integrates multimedia technology and health-care education concepts to facilitate learning, while being useful and easy to use. Results from a pilot study indicate that OMARC significantly helps to improve the capacity of the users to correctly identify lung sounds for different respiratory conditions. In addition, participants' opinions about OMARC were quite positive: users were likely to recommend the application to other persons in their field and found the application easy to use and helpful to better identify lung sounds.

A proactive collaborative consortium has been established to help meet the demand for nursing education in the 13 most rural mountain counties of western North Carolina. Through a 2-year process with regional networking, the nursing administration of Western Carolina University, Mission Hospitals, Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, and affiliated community colleges, consortium hospitals, and emergency care services developed a vision and a proposal for an innovative program for the nursing education of the future. The consortium proposed the establishment of a 3-year integrated educational program utilizing state-of-the-art simulation manikin technology. Financial resources were obtained from a charitable grant from The Duke Endowment (Charlotte, NC). Sustainability of funding will be ensured through university, hospital, and community college collaboration. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Patient simulation has been used to augment the traditional clinical model, but its value is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a theory-driven pediatric simulation curriculum on nursing students' clinical performance. The convenience sample included 116 junior nursing students enrolled in a pediatric course. Using a staggered timing model, students attended simulation instead of clinical for 2 weeks (25%) of an 8-week semester. The students spent the same amount of time in simulation as in clinical (12 hours per week). Student clinical performance was assessed using a Likert-style tool at 2-week intervals by the clinical faculty. Scores of students who attended simulation in the first 2 weeks were compared with students who had not yet attended simulation. Data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis with the mixed model, and covariate effects were considered. A Compound Symmetry covariance model was used to control the correlation between weeks within each subject. Statistical significance was determined at the 5% level. Faculty rated students with patient simulation experience higher than those who had not yet attended simulation (mean ± standard error: 1.74 ± 0.75, P = 0.02). On item-level analysis, therapeutic skills were positively impacted by simulation (P = 0.02). Time in simulation enhanced clinical performance, as simulation students achieved higher scores more quickly than those without simulation and maintained high performance levels. These findings suggest patient simulation is a valuable addition to augment the apprenticeship model.

%X Objective: Hypertension is one of the most frequent conditions treated in primary practice, and accounts for 51% of stroke deaths and 45% of ischemic heart disease deaths. Accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is reliant on both the devices that are used and best practice procedures. Increasingly busy clinical environments may lead to procedures for accurately measuring BP being overlooked or ignored, a problem identified across health services nationally and internationally. There is also reliance that the devices that we are using are accurate. Therefore current practices for measuring BP and accuracy of equipment were determined across a tertiary health service. Design and method: There were 23 hospital wards audited to identify types of monitors in use and their accuracy was validated according to AS EN 1060.2-2002 for pressure scale accuracy. Skills knowledge was assessed for 74 Medical students (33 first year and 41 second year) and 166 clinical staff. Results: We validated 107 monitors and found 14/56 (39%) digital monitors and 14/51 (25%) aneroid tested had unacceptable errors (> 3 mmHg), which was comparable with other health services (1). Only 17% of clinical staff had annual in-service training for measurement of BP and only 50% of medical students (Stage 1 and 2) retained their BP measurement skills. Conclusions: The results of this study identified the need for providing professional staff a training program that is accessible and available for self-directed learning as well as understanding the advantages and limitations of the various devices used for BP measurement. An e-learning module “Standardising Skills for Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement” was developed and has now been implemented into the Medical and Nursing curriculum as well as across health services and primary care practices. Data generated from the surveys within the module is currently being analysed.

%X The objective of the study presented here was to perform an empirical investigation on factors affecting healthcare workers acceptance and utilisation of e-learning in post-school healthcare education. E-learning benefits are realised when key features of e-learning are not only applied, but deemed useful, compatible with the learning process and supportive in order to reach the overall goals of the learning process. We conducted a survey of 14 state-enrolled nurses and skilled-workers within the field of healthcare in Norway. The results show that perceived compatibility and subjective norm explain system usage of the e-learning tool amongst the students. We found that the fact that the students considered the e-learning to be compatible with the course in question had a positive effect on e-learning tool usage. We also found support for factors such as facilitating conditions and ease of use leads to the e-learning tool being considered useful. © 2009 European Federation for Medical Informatics.

%X Background: The use of non-pharmacological pain management remains adhoc within acute paediatric burns pain management protocols despite ongoing acknowledgement of its role. Advancements in adult based pain services including the integration of virtual reality has been adapted to meet the needs of children in pain, as exemplified by the development of multi-modal distraction (MMD). This easy to use, hand held interactive device uses customised programs designed to inform the child about the procedure he/she is about to experience and to distract the child during dressing changes. Aim: (1) To investigate if either MMD procedural preparation (MMD-PP) or distraction (MMD-D) has a greater impact on child pain reduction compared to standard distraction (SD) or hand held video game distraction (VG), (2) to understand the impact of MMD-PP and MMD-D on clinic efficiency by measuring length of treatment across groups, and lastly, (3) to assess the efficacy of distraction techniques over three dressing change procedures. Methods: A prospective randomised control trial was completed in a paediatric tertiary hospital Burns Outpatient Clinic. Eighty participants were recruited and studied over their first three dressing changes. Pain was assessed using validated child report, caregiver report, nursing observation and physiological measures. Results: MMD-D and MMD-PP were both shown to significantly relieve reported pain (p ≤ 0.05) and reduce the time taken for dressings (p ≤ 0.05) compared to SD and VG. The positive effects of both MMD-D and MMD-PP were sustained with subsequent dressing changes. Conclusions: The use of MMD as a preparatory or a distraction tool in an outpatient burns clinic offered superior pain reduction across three dressing changes to children when compared to standard practices or hand held video games. This device has the potential to improve clinic efficiency with reductions in treatment lengths. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

%X BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend systematic assessment of pain, agitation/sedation and delirium with validated scales for all ICU patients. However, these evaluations are often not done. We have created an e-learning training platform for the continuous medical education, and assessed its efficacy in increasing the use of validated tools by all medical and nursing staff of the participating ICUs during their daily practice. METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, before and after study. The eight participating centers were randomized in two groups, and received training at different times. The use of validated tools (Verbal Numeric Rating or Behavioral Pain Scale for pain; Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale for agitation; Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for delirium) was evaluated from clinical data recorded in medical charts during a week, with follow-up up to six months after the training. All the operators were invited to complete a questionnaire, at baseline and after the training. RESULTS : Among the 374 nurses and physicians involved, 140 (37.4%) completed at least one of the three courses. The assessment of pain (38.1 vs. 92.9%, P<0.01) and delirium (0 vs. 78.6%, P<0.01) using validated tools significantly increased after training. Observation in the follow-up showed further improvement in delirium monitoring, with no signs of extinction for pain and sedation/agitation measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This e-learning program shows encouraging effectiveness, and the increase in the use of validated tools for neurological monitoring in critically ill patients lasts over time.

%X Background: Shortages of human resources for health (HRH) remain a major bottleneck to increasing access to health services in sub-Saharan Africa. As the global health agenda evolves from a focus on the Millennium Development Goals to Universal Health Coverage, and as countries' disease priorities increasingly include both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, strengthening production of HRH remains a priority. While the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supports national HIV responses, its substantial investments in HRH have been leveraged to address priority health concerns more broadly. The goal of this session is to describe the PEPFAR program's approach to strengthening health training institutions and HRH education, drawing on the experiences of several projects managed centrally and at the field level. At the preservice level, the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI), the Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI), and the Global Health Services Partnership (GHSP) offer three unique models of institutional capacity building focused on clinical providers. The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) focuses on training of the public health workforce. Additional country-driven investments capacitate training and education of a range of cadres-from community health workers to those obtaining doctoral degrees in the health sciences to social workers. At the in-service level, PEPFAR increasingly supports linkages with both preservice training and service delivery, such as through development of national in-service training frameworks and institutionalization of continuing professional development structures. Finally, PEPFAR has facilitated interlinkages between institutions supported by these different programs, such as through linking FETP and MEPI curricula. PEPFAR's approach indicates that HRH investments in a vertical disease program can serve as a platform for strengthening training institutions and education systems more broadly. Structure/Method/Design: Presentation(s) followed by Q&A/ discussion Results (Scientific Abstract)/Collaborative Partners (Programmatic Abstract): CDC, USAID, HRSA, NIH, Peace Corps Summary/Conclusion: ∗ Leveraging a vertical disease platform to strengthen education and training systems comprehensively and broadly ∗ Capitalizing on the comparative advantages of multiple US government agencies to comprehensively build national capacity in education and training institutions.

%X Background: Nurses as the members of health care professionals need to improve their knowledge and competencies particularly in diabetes mellitus through continuing nursing education programs. E-learning is an indirect method of training that can meet nurses' educational needs. This study is aimed at validating a web-based diabetes education program through measurement of nurses' knowledge and clinical competency in diabetes and nurses' perception about its usability and quality. Methods: This Quasi-experimental research was conducted on a single group of 31 nurses employed in hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. We used a 125 MCQ knowledge test and Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) to measure knowledge and clinical competency of nurses in diabetes before and after intervention. A Learning Management System (LMS) was designed to provide educational content in the form of 12 multimedia electronic modules, interactive tests; a forum and learning activities. Nurses were trained for two months in this system after which the post-test was administered. Each nurse completed two questionnaires for measurement of their perceptions on usability and quality. We used descriptive statistics for demographic and descriptive data analysis. Paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-data using SPSS. Results: The findings showed significant differences in knowledge scores (p < 0.001), total score of clinical competencies (p < 0.001), and all ten assessed clinical competencies. The range of ratings given by participants varied on the six usability variables of Web-based training (2.96-4.23 from 5) and eight quality variables of Web-based training (3.58-4.37 from 5). Conclusion: Web-based education increased nurses' knowledge and competencies in diabetes. They positively evaluated Web-based learning usability and quality. It is hoped that this course will have a positive clinical outcomes.

%X Aims: E-consultation via patient record sharing is a method of integrating primary and secondary care, allowing care closer tohome. Weaudited 100 e-consultations toinvestigate take-up ofthe service as well as the pattern, subject of referral and efficiency of the process. Methods: Patient consent was obtained by the practices prior to record sharing. E-consultations performed by a bespoke template were reviewed using a pre-defined audit tool. Results: Altogether 96% of referrals had patients' consent and agreed procedure was followed in 75% of cases. 91% of referrals were deemed appropriate and of these 79% were for new patients. 11% of these were patients with poor functional status. The majority (66%) of referrals were made by practice nurses, 26% by GPs and 8% by community matrons. 60% of requests were answered within 24h and 73% within 72h. Most consultations (89%) were diabetes related of which 48% were about insulin. Approximately 50% of the insulin related advice referred to dose titration, the remainder referring to insulin initiation or regimen change. Other e-consultations referred to oral agents, GLP-1 and endocrine related advice at 25%, 16% and 7% respectively. Advice was followed in more than 90% of cases. Conclusions: Given the trend to deliver routine diabetes management in primary care, concerns exist regarding the positioning and input of specialist care in patient management. E-consultation is a platform to deliver this whilst allowing integration as well as governance. It is also highly valued by primary care colleagues.

%X Background/Purpose: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is more common among Asians compared with Whites but the prevalence of SLE is significantly low compared with common chronic medical diseases in westernised city like Hong Kong. This study aimed to evaluate medical student knowledge on SLE and their feedback on teaching on SLE related topics at a medical school in Hong Kong. Methods: Senior medical students were recruited to complete a self administered questionnaire regarding learning, teaching and subjects regarded as important in SLE. Results: A total of 124 (109 MBBS IV, 15 MBBS V) medical students from the University of Hong Kong were recruited. Majority of students acquired knowledge on SLE from standard sources provided by curriculum teaching including lectures (98.4%), textbook (96.7%), patient contact (86.1%) and problem based learning sessions (64.8%). A significant proportion of students (77.0%) also obtained knowledge from internet and e-learning. An addition of 36.4% of students also preferred learning from extra-curricular sources including education leaflets from professional societies, family contact and television program. Most students regarded knowledge on clinical presentations (45.4%), diagnosis (49.6%) management and treatment (76.5%) as the most fundamental knowledge an average doctor should know more about SLE. Renal disease was considered most important (36.7%) among all organ involvement in SLE teaching. Only 8.4% of students regarded epidemiology and pathogenesis as essential but overall importance of subjects on epidemiology and pathogenesis, management and complications ranked 4.0/5, 4.3/5 and 4.2/5 respectively. These senior medical students graded their confidence in knowledge in SLE as 3.4/5. In general, the quality (3.9/5) and quantity (3.5/5) of teaching regarding SLE is good. Majority (85.1%) of students preferred to be taught by rheumatologists where as only 15.8% regarded rheumatology nurse as important sources. Conclusion: Majority of students were satisfied with current curriculum teaching and valued clinical management with higher priority than epidemiology and pathogenesis among the taught subjects. Extracurricular sources of learning including information from professional societies and rheumatology nurse may be considered as adjunct to teaching.

%X Learning Objectives: 1. To educate interventional radiologists on potential methods to discuss radiation risks with patients 2. To provide an easy-to-use template consent form for interventional radiologists to discuss radiation risks with patients Background: Radiation exposure has become an important topic in prominent medical journals and social media [1]. Interventional radiologists (IRs) are involved with many procedures that use fluoroscopy and CT guidance that involve radiation exposure to themselves, technologists, nurses, and most of all, patients. There are small, but not insignificant risks to skin, eyes, other organs, and developing ionizing radiation associated cancer [2]. A standardized consent form would make the consent process easier and more time efficient for IRs while ensuring patients are provided with the necessary information to make informed decisions. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: A template consent form could be given to all referring physicians and interventional radiologists to discuss radiation risks involved in IR procedures. This easy-to-use consent form serves a dual purpose: (1) to educate patients on radiation risks, and (2) to document that radiation risks were explained to the patients. Furthermore, IRs can also use a variety of methods to educate patients on radiation risks, including developing pamphlets, directing patients to relevant online resources such as the website of the Society of Interventional Radiology (www.sirweb.org), and educating referring physicians on radiation risks through presentations at their annual meetings and publishing articles on radiation risks in their journals. Conclusion and/or Teaching Points: Interventional radiologists should consider routinely obtaining informed consent for their IR procedures. IRs are encouraged to use the suggested standardized easy-to-use template consent form to discuss radiation risks with patients. In addition, a variety of methods can be used by interventional radiologists to discuss radiation risks with patients.

%X Background Hypertension is probably the most important public health problem in developed countries. It is a common and asymptomatic disorder that is easy to detect and almost always easy to treat. The condition is associated with disability, diminished quality of life and early death if not treated. Hypertension can be prevented and reduced through changes in lifestyle. Early management is therefore essential, making use of the available healthcare resources as efficiently as possible. This implies the participation of all those health agents capable of offering effective care (physicians, pharmacists, nurses). Purpose To develop lines of cooperation between SEH-LELHA and SEFAC, and coordinated strategies designed to improve collaboration between those physicians and pharmacists that treat patients with hypertension and/or vascular problems. To train community pharmacists in the management of hypertension and vascular risk. To improve the care received by patients treated with antihypertensive drugs and prevent and reduce their vascular risk. To improve vascular risk screening skills. To train and qualify professional pharmaceutical services related to hypertension and vascular risk. Method The study was designed by physicians and pharmacists, and consisted of four phases. Phase 1: Online training with seven modules and jointly developed by physicians and pharmacists. Phase 2: Teaching of practical workshops on blood pressure measurement and control, based on isolated measurement in the community pharmacy, self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and on vascular risk measurement and control in the community pharmacy. These workshops were taught jointly by physicians and pharmacists and tackle actual clinical cases. Phase 3: On-site evaluation of the knowledge gained in the workshops. Phase 4: Registry of clinical cases using an online platform specifically designed for this purpose, reflecting knowledge through patient recruitment and application of the pharmacist-patient-physician communication protocol. Findings Ten physicians and 13 pharmacists took part in preparing the online course. 1485 students have enrolled in the programme; 499 have passed the online phase. A total of 28 workshops have been taught by 18 SEFAC pharmacists and 18 SEH-LELHA physicians, with the participation of 877 students. 281 students underwent an onsite examination and four failed. The online platform has been opened to register clinical cases for those students who have at least passed the online phase and have attended the on-site workshop (180 licences provided). Conclusion The communication lines established among the professionals facilitate improved hypertensive patient care. The impacHta programme offers integral qualification for pharmacists, ensuring the scientific training needed to introduce, manage and provide the service, including communication with the patient, referral to the physician and subsequent follow-up.

%X Automation of nursing documentation in client records is one of today's formidable challenges in healthcare settings. Some stakeholders view standardized nursing language as a fundamental component of an automated record, with the end goal of generating valid, reliable data on nursing services and client outcomes. However, few successful applications of standardized nursing language for practice standards and data generation exist in the literature. A joint practice-and-data quality project based on standardized nursing language in an automated platform was undertaken by four local public health departments. Outcomes of this project included articulation of standards for nursing practice and creation and implementation of a sound data quality infrastructure for nursing documentation of client assessments, service delivery information, and client outcomes.

%X Social media is becoming a facet of our lives and a tool for connecting, uniting and supporting people. Its use is growing in nursing, medical and health settings. This article describes the process, development and growth of an online community to connect nurses via Twitter using hashtags. Data was analysed to identify the benefits, barriers and enablers for the creation of an online nursing community. Methods consisted of key word searches in Twitter relevant to nursing, visits to the WeNurses website and tracking the number of followers on the website. A social media monitoring tool (SM2) was used to monitor visibility to establish baseline data and identify trends. WeNurses was launched in July 2012 and has over 7000 followers. Visits to the website are between 500 and 1500 each day.The use of a systematic nursing approach including the key principles of both nursing and social media (honesty, transparency, listening and reacting) helped to create and develop an online nursing community. It was found that WeNurses provides a platform for nurses to discuss issues in nursing, or complain about reforms. Nurses are free to question on how they can improve skills and contemplate their understanding of changes in the health service. Enablers included a committed group who openly discussed their thoughts, opinions and practices, a shared identity, an understanding each other's perspective and ownership by members. Using a nursing framework in a digital space added a unique dimension that resonated with members and provided a structured approach to the project. Nurses have begun to not only embrace social media but also use it for their own development. Health employers also need to encourage use of social media to help develop expertise, experience and knowledge in nurses and nursing practice. Social media can provide a social and professional space for nurses, and has potential to influence the health and wellness of different population groups involved in both giving and receiving nursing care. © 2014 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

%X Nurses and midwives are increasingly using social media as a professional tool. This is reflected in the Nursing and Midwifery Council's (NMC) new professional code, which says nurses must use social media and other communication responsibly, respecting the right to privacy of others at all times. A growing body of literature documents the positive influence social media, when used appropriately, can have on nurses' practice and the care they deliver to patients. However, nurses need more guidance and training to ensure online professionalism and appropriate behaviour online. Requiring nurses and midwives to complete an online continuous professional development course on social networking at the point of revalidation could keep them up to date and promote online professionalism.

%X METHODS: The intervention group used an adaptive self-learning e-learning tool developed by the research team (ePULab) for pressure ulcer assessment and treatment. The control group received a traditional on-campus class on the same topic. Pretest and post-test questionnaires were designed to assess the students' ability in pressure ulcer diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: The educational intervention based on the use of the ePULab tool produced significantly better learning acquisition results than those obtained by traditional lecture-style classes: the total score improved in the control group from 8·23 (SD 1·23)-11·6 (SD 2·52) after the lecture, whereas in the intervention group, the knowledge score changed from 8·27 (SD 1·39)-15·83 (SD 2·52) (p = 0·01) with the use of ePULab. CONCLUSIONS: The results show a higher effectiveness of the devised e-learning approach for education on management of pressure ulcers. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our results reveal the suitability of the ePULab e-learning tool as an effective instrument for training on assessment of and treatment for pressure ulcers and its potential impact on clinical decision-making. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of information and communication technologies in the undergraduate students' pressure ulcer training as a learning tool, compared with traditional teaching methods. BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers constitute one of the great challenges faced by nursing professionals. Currently, pressure ulcer training is based on traditional on-campus teaching, involving lecture-style classes with frequent use of photographs of the wounds. This traditional training has some important weaknesses that can put the efficacy of the training at risk. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial was developed including undergraduate nursing students.

%X Background Rheumatology nursing management is a relevant strategic challenge. The recent “EULAR recommendations for the role of the nurse in the management of chronic inflammatory arthritis” indicate specific goals for a wide range of interventions. Thus, an effective educational agenda is urgently needed to support the access to high quality education for nurses. Objectives To determine the response of nurses a web-based e-learning programme. Methods AIR (Assistenza Infermieristica Reumatologica) is an educational website that was created in November 2009 (www.aircommunity.it). It represents the first experience in Italy of a teaching website specifically oriented to rheumatology nurses. The main goal of AIR is to provide useful information on several knowledge domains including the ABC of the rheumatic diseases, counseling, patient education, and risk management. From the November 2011 AIR website also includes an e-learning platform that permits to obtain certified learning credits by a “problem solving” approach. Eight clinical cases highly representative of daily rheumatological practice are included in the project (three cases have already been published). Each case description includes 16 specific questions focused on various clinical nursing problems. To obtain learning credits, all the questions had to be answered. Results The visitors' number of the website increased from 200 (November 2009) to 13225 (January 2012). The registered users are currently 1450. In spite the website is in Italian, a total of 11.775 pages have been visited by navigators from other European countries and 3.893 navigators from United States. In three months a total of 1019 nurses were involved in the e-learning platform of clinical cases. 628 nurses out of 871 passed the test assessment of the first case; 500 out of 606 nurses passed the test assessment of the second case whereas 352 out of 420 nurses passed the test assessment of the third case. Conclusions The results of our preliminary e-learning experience focused on rheumatology nursing are encouraging. The fast increase of visitors over the last three months indicates a strong interest by nurses to the “problem solving” approach.

%X The ability to accurately document undergraduate student nurses' development while in the clinical area is a requirement of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Owing to a number of strategic and pragmatic drivers, the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Southampton has developed and implemented an e-Assessment of Professional Practice (eAoPP). This platform enables the student, mentor and academic staff to access the portfolio from any internet enabled device and has been rolled out in phases over 2 years to more than 5000 students and mentors. The key factors underpinning the success of the project are presented along with an audit and preliminary analysis of support service activity provided during the roll out to 380 students in January 2015 across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Plans for future development, including employability and roll out to other student groups are discussed.

%X Introduction: The system of an inhospital rapid response team (RRT) is desired to be set up. Our hospital adopted a unique rapid response system (RRS) constructed with two different systems (organized and systematic system to activate RRT members, and nonorganized and nonsystematic system to gather doctors and nurses near the scene) with an inhospital whole paging system (doctor call (DC)). The object of this study is to clarify the usefulness and problems of our RRS. Methods: We examined the records of 55 patients enrolled in our RRS for the past 2.5 years and evaluated the change of the death rate in whole discharged patients before and after the establishment of the RRS. Our unique RRS is as follows. A hospital staff member who finds a collapsed patient/visitor or a patient/visitor requiring urgent medical support or another staff near the scene calls the inhospital whole paging system (DC), which is announced in all areas of the hospital. Staff of the Critical Care and Emergency Center (CCE Center) bring an automated extracorporeal defibrillator and one bag prepared for the emergency crisis for one person. Other staff near the scene bring a monitor, oxygen, emergency cart and stretcher. We established an inhospital educational course for basic life support and basic resuscitation skill and a self-educating system using an e-learning system. Results: The events mainly occurred in the diagnostic and treatment room, waiting area, examination room for blood sampling or X-ray examination in the outpatient department (55%) and in the lavatory (5%). They seldom occurred in the critical care area (2%). The reasons why bystanders decided to start up the RRS are suspected cardiac arrest (13%), loss of consciousness (18%), witnessed falling down (31%), and lying down (16%). The mean time interval between the event and DC is 0.96 and that between the event and responding staff arrival at the scene is 1.81 minutes, respectively. The definitive diagnoses were cardiopulmonary arrest in 15%, cardiac event in 5% and psychiatric in 27%. In nine cardiopulmonary arrest cases, 33% were identified as an indication of resuscitation because of 'do not attempt resuscitation' during activity. The RRT managed 59% of the patients within 1.1 minutes. Both the hospital death rate per total discharged patients and that excepting patients treated in our CCE Center showed a decreasing tendency after official organization in the hospital as a regular system. Conclusions: Our unique RRS is thought to work well. However, it needs to be helped by other doctors working nearer the scene than the RRT.

%X This paper discusses the introduction of blended learning strategies, a combination of traditional and online techniques, into the first year of a new preregistration nursing advanced diploma and degree programme at Bournemouth University (UK).During a ten week sociology of health academic unit, in the first term of a three year nursing course, wikis were introduced as a complementary learning technique to traditional lectures and seminars. Wikis, an online application, provided eleven student seminar groups (each divided into 4 online or elearning groups of 6-8 students) with the potential to communicate collaboratively "anytime, anywhere" (JISC, 2010) to discuss a sociology preparation activity for the preceding week. The implementation of this elearning tool was structured through the application of Salmon's five stage model (Salmon, 2002) and evaluated from 69 students' online contributions to wikis as well as questionnaires completed by both a sample of students and academic staff. As well as the many comments made by students the evaluation indicated that 45% of students' responses valued wikis as a communication tool and 33% believed it promoted or allowed the sharing of group views.The evaluation presents and critiques the initial project management using Salmon's five stage model and the engagement of students and academic staff. In particular it begins to show how wikis have the potential to structure academic learning and promote social networking in the crucial first few months of a course. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The ability of healthcare professionals to provide their patients with good, evidence based clinical care is vital. This involves seeking out the best available evidence, analysing, critically appraising and applying this to clinical practice. A vast amount of literature is available to the Paediatrician, but many trainees cite time constraints and limited critical appraisal skills as reasons for not keeping abreast with the latest evidence. We undertook a region-wide, trainee-led, collaborative initiative between medical and nursing staff to promote engagement with important new research and enhance critical appraisal skills amongst Paediatric trainees. In 2014 we introduced Paediatric Journal Review (PJR), a monthly 'newsletter' style production, which incorporated critical reviews of recently published journal articles considered of interest and relevance to trainees and to clinical practice. Each month, members of the editorial team searched for suitable articles through Medline databases, twitter alerts, and a hand trawl of key Paediatric and Neonatal journals. Articles were selected for inclusion based on relevance, interest and quality. Each issue of the PJR had a theme, with issues to date including Neonatal medicine, General Paediatrics, Community Paediatrics and Paediatric Surgery. Articles were summarised in 350 words to include methodology and key findings, with emphasis on key limitations and potential clinical implications. Reviews were drafted by members of the editorial team and 'guest reviewers'. Reviews were independently scrutinised by another member of the editorial team to ensure consistency and quality. A finalised PDF production was then circulated to all nurses, nurse-practitioners, Paediatric trainees and consultants in the region via email. After one year of monthly production, an analysis of the effect of this initiative was conducted with a short electronic survey sent out to all potential readers. We received 42 responses from Consultants (29%), trainees (68%), and nurse practitioners (2%), with key results presented in Table 1. All respondents felt that articles were of the right length and were easy to read, with an equal preference for monthly or alternate monthly issues. Additional main comments were that more themed issues should be included, and that there was too much a predominance of neonatal articles. Wider availability of PJR, for example via social media, was also requested. Whilst there is likely to be some responder bias, this feedback is encouraging. In particular, the reviews seem to be aiding knowledge and clinical practice. In response to the survey, PJR has been converted to an alternate monthly format, with alternation between Paediatric and Neonatal themed issues. Additionally, we have encouraged a broader range of reviewers to increase trainee involvement in the critical appraisal process and encompass a wider selection of review topics. We are also exploring the possibility of social media links to PJR along with discussion forums. This project has had some limitations. The original editorial board is small and consists of members with a predominantly Neonatal background. This has made the selection of relevant non-neonatal articles more challenging - an aspect that we hope to improve as trainee involvement increases. The editorial team feel this has been a worthwhile and rewarding project that is achieving measurable improvements in trainee engagement with evidence and critical appraisal. By improving our collective knowledge base and ability to critically appraise, we believe it is possible to positively affect clinical practice and ultimately improve patient care. (Table Presented).

%X Background: 1:280 Australians are believed to carry a faulty cancer repair gene associated with LS. The health system has no record of how many are diagnosed, cancer control services are not designed for those with multiple, different cancers; and there is no designated practitioner whose role it is to help those living with cancer and the threat of cancer, navigate the siloed health system and coordinate vital surveillance regimes. Only about 40% of adults have the level of individual health literacy needed to meet the complex demands of everyday life. Individuals with LS are often left to manage alone without understanding the syndrome, its risks, the health system and where to access support. Aims: Findings from Lynch Syndrome Australia's (LSA) world-first 2015 survey of 465 health consumers shaped a 2-year program. Initiatives were designed to address the main challenges, such as bespoke support and information, for some of the 100 000 affected Australians. Method: First, LSA designed a model for patient engagement that created a community of patients, practitioners and researchers, which instilled a culture of cooperation with health consumers. Next, they explored how to make consumers part of the solution and work in partnership with health care professionals to manage this lifelong condition by reviewing best practice worldwide. Results: LSA delivered seven national seminars to 330 consumers who engaged with a network of 30 medical and research experts. LSA created leading-edge, evidence-based website and social media platforms, including an advocacy video viewed 10 500 times. Conclusions: These initiatives represent the first coordinated support for those with LS. As more Australians are diagnosed, it is imperative to educate health professionals to be partners in care and support, as modeled by breast cancer nurse care.

%X BACKGROUND: Bridging the research-practice gap is a challenge for health care. Fostering awareness of and interest in research and development (R & D) can serve as a platform to help nurses and others bridge this gap. Strategic communication is an interdisciplinary field that has been used to achieve long-term interest in adopting and applying R & D in primary care. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a strategic communication intervention on long-term interest in R & D among primary care staff members (PCSMs) in general and registered nurses (RNs) in particular. METHODS: This prospective intervention study included all members of the PCSMs, including RNs, in a Swedish primary care area. The interest of PCSMs in R & D was measured on two occasions, at 7 and 12 years, using both bivariate and multivariate tests. RESULTS: A total of 99.5% of RNs gained awareness of R & D after the first 7 years of intervention versus 95% of the remaining PCSMs (p = .004). A comparison of the two measurements ascertained stability and improvement of interest in R & D among RNs, compared with all other PCSMs (odds ratio 1.81; confidence interval 1.08-3.06). Moreover, the RNs who did become interested in R & D also demonstrated increased intention to adopt innovative thinking in their work over time (p = .005). LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: RNs play an important role in reducing the gap between theory and practice. Strategic communication was a significant tool for inspiring interest in R & D. Application of this platform to generate interest in R & D is a unique intervention and should be recognized for future interventions in primary care. Positive attitudes toward R & D may reinforce the use of evidence-based practice in health care, thereby making a long-term contribution to the patient benefit.

%X Purpose: International outreach or “twinning” programs are quite common in pediatric oncology. Many hospitals now recognize the importance of multidisciplinary teams and support nursing international outreach programs around the world. There are many opportunities for training formedical doctors but fewerforothermembers of the multidisciplinary team such as dietitians, speech pathologists, physical therapists, and social workers. Method: The Clinical Nutrition Department together with the International Outreach Program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital initiated a training program for pediatric oncology dietitians from around the world in 2005. Since that time, St. Jude has hosted dietitians from Mexico, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Guatemala. The purpose of this program is to share information and foster cooperation. In the 3-week program, dietitians have a chance to observe St. Jude dietitians working in hematology, leukemia, solid tumors, neuro-oncology, and the bone marrow transplantation unit. Food Service and Infectious Diseases rotations can be accommodated upon request. Results: Continuation of the program after dietitians return to their home countries is accomplished via webcast through Cure4Kids (www.cure4kids.org). The Clinical Nutrition Department and International Outreach Program provide assistance for air travel, hotels, and meals. Conclusion: The main obstacles we have identified in our efforts are financial problems, language barriers, and differences in job descriptions.

%X Involving patients in all aspects of their medical and nursing care should be standard practice within any healthcare system. Gaining informed consent from patients for medical interventions is a legal requirement. Consent (where possible) must be obtained before treatment; the risks, benefits and alternatives (where appropriate) must be explained. The 'Expert Patient' is a term used for some patients who have chronic conditions (such as a haematological or renal disease). Being an 'Expert Patient' not only helps them to live with their disease better but ensures they understand all therapies relevant to their condition. Although patients with short-term conditions are less likely to become 'expert', all patients have access to a great deal of information through the Internet. They can all research their condition and gain a better understanding of the treatments required (including blood transfusion). Blood transfusion has often been regarded as a part of the patient's overall treatment whether undergoing chemotherapy or having a surgical procedure. Historically separate consent was not sought for blood transfusion. However it is now regarded best practice to seek informal consent from the patient, ensuring understanding of the risks, benefits and alternatives to transfusion. It is also expected that a discussion will take place with the patient if transfusion occurred unexpectedly and pre-transfusion informed consent was not possible (e.g. in trauma). Within the limited literature available on patient information and consent it is apparent that consent for blood transfusion is variable. However there have been recent initiatives to standardise the process such as the SaBTO (Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs) recommendations in the UK, and it is an integral part of all established Patient Blood Management programmes in the USA and Australia. To improve patient involvement in the transfusion process, it is important to ensure those who are discussing transfusion therapy include the rationale for transfusion, the benefits, risks and alternatives. The consenter must have the relevant transfusion knowledge and information to give to the patient. This is achieved through a programme of training and education and making this process integral to all patient care. Training of clinical staff can vary from locally-led teaching sessions to undertaking an established national programme such as the 'Learn Blood Transfusion' elearning in the UK. It is also necessary to have a process in place that triggers and records these discussions so they become part of the patient's transfusion pathway. There are a number of possible processes that can be developed into a policy including a paper-based consent sticker, patient information booklets, a decision-to-transfuse programme on an IT system or clear documentation in the patient's record. The Transfusion Practitioner has a critical role in this by bringing all the required elements together for clinical staff, in order to make patients part of the transfusion process.

%X Through this paper, we present the initial steps for the creation of an integrated platform for the provision of a series of eHealth tools and services to both citizens and travelers in isolated areas of the southeast Mediterranean, and on board ships travelling across it. The platform was created through an INTERREG IIIB ARCHIMED project called INTERMED. The support of primary healthcare, home care and the continuous education of physicians are the three major issues that the proposed platform is trying to facilitate. The proposed system is based on state-of-the-art telemedicine systems and is able to provide the following healthcare services: i) Telecollaboration and teleconsultation services between remotely located healthcare providers, ii) telemedicine services in emergencies, iii) home telecare services for "at risk" citizens such as the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, and iv) eLearning services for the continuous training through seminars of both healthcare personnel (physicians, nurses etc) and persons supporting "at risk" citizens.These systems support data transmission over simple phone lines, internet connections, integrated services digital network/digital subscriber lines, satellite links, mobile networks (GPRS/3G), and wireless local area networks. The data corresponds, among others, to voice, vital biosignals, still medical images, video, and data used by eLearning applications. The proposed platform comprises several systems, each supporting different services. These were integrated using a common data storage and exchange scheme in order to achieve system interoperability in terms of software, language and national characteristics. The platform has been installed and evaluated in different rural and urban sites in Greece, Cyprus and Italy. The evaluation was mainly related to technical issues and user satisfaction. The selected sites are, among others, rural health centers, ambulances, homes of "at-risk" citizens, and a ferry. The results proved the functionality and utilization of the platform in various rural places in Greece, Cyprus and Italy. However, further actions are needed to enable the local healthcare systems and the different population groups to be familiarized with, and use in their everyday lives, mature technological solutions for the provision of healthcare services.

%X Purpose/Objective(s): Recent public reports of radiation misadministrations have prompted the need to develop new ways to strengthen radiation oncology QA. Chart rounds (CR) is a seminal part of this QA process. However, weekly CR often focuses on patient status and field design while important details of physics treatment plans (TPs), including dose distributions, PTV coverage and DVHs are largely unexplored. To remedy this limitation, we propose a more comprehensive CR presentation using a telemedicine (TM) platform to involve physicians, physicists, RT therapists and nurses. A 3-month pilot study was undertaken between 4 MSKCC regional sites to include rapid visual display of routine portal imaging and critical components of radiation TPs. This information was displayed on a large monitor for convenient visualization. The system enabled participation at remote sites using teleconferencing software. Materials/Methods: Using the TM platform, each patient presentation included a brief HPI, display of routine portal and summary images from the TP. This included dose distributions on axial, sagittal, coronal CT slices, DVH and dose tables. With this new CR format, a survey was created assessing satisfaction, efficiency, depth of discussion, and impact on patient management. The surveys were given to physicians, physicists, RT therapists and nurses after CR over a 12-wk period. Each factor was rated on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being best possible score. For comparison, an equal number of surveys were distributed during the old CR format. Results: Over 12-weeks, a total of 12 CR sessions were evaluated (6 old; 6 new format).Asimilar number of cases were presented for both the old and new format (an average of 6.3 complex cases/wk with 3.6 IMRT cases). Mean satisfaction for the new CR format was greater (4.4 of 5) than for the old format (2.1 of 5). More changes were consistently made to TPs using the comprehensive CR. A total of 8 changes (21% of plans) were made both to re-define tumor coverage (palliative, sarcoma, breast, lung, head/neck) and to limit toxicity. Only one change (4.1%) was made to TPs using the old format of CR. Surveys showed a high level of satisfaction with incorporation of TPs. Surveys showed significant increases in confidence using the TM platform for CR, as well as increased satisfaction with the depth and efficiency of patient-related discussions. Participants also gave high ratings to the impact of the new CR format on their future medical practice. Conclusions: Changes to the presentation format were successful in fostering additional discussion of patient treatments. The new CR template created a superior environment for peer review and in-depth, real-time analysis of TPs. This resulted in a greater refinement of TPs and led to improved patient care.

%X A recent point prevalence study completed across 15 Victorian Health Services identified malnutrition as highly prevalent in the inpatient and ambulatory oncology settings. A core recommendation from this study was to develop a resource to increase awareness, understanding and the appropriate management of malnutrition amongst multidisciplinary cancer clinicians. E-learning resources were the selected medium, with the goal to optimise the accessibility, reach and impact. E-learning presents benefits in cost effectiveness; enhanced audience engagement and response; consistency and currency of information; accessibility and flexibility in time, pace and location; monitoring capacity; and opportunity for innovative, interactive, active learning. Focussed, discipline specific cancer malnutrition E-learning packages were developed for medical, allied health, nursing, general practitioners and practice nurse domains to promote awareness, identification, early intervention and management. Through education and enhanced management, patient outcomes are expected to benefit. Development of the packages considered key theories in adult learning given the diverse target audience. Kolb's Experiential Learning theory was consulted and a range of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic information modalities utilised to enhance educational impact on cancer clinicians. Videos, images, maps and charts were utilised throughout to engage visual learners. Auditory learners will benefit from consistent written and verbal information presented by a narrator, clinicians and patients as well as a range of written information as fact-sheets, education resources, clinical tools and a comprehensive literature review. The resource includes a range of interactive activities throughout to engage those who learn kinaesthetically. In many cases, a combination of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic information was presented to optimise the influence of the information provided. This e-learning package is an example of an innovative, interactive, evidence-based health education package. A number of pedagogic strategies and theories have been employed to meet the learning needs of a wide and diverse audience to ultimate enhance patient care and outcomes.

%X The development of e-learning as a teaching strategy in higher education has implications relating to student learning, the role of the teacher, and the institution of higher education. This paper debates the andragogical and pedagogical theories that support the development of e-learning to date. Leading to a discussion on how the process of e-learning may be contributing to the "stamp-me-smart" culture and restricting the development of critical thinking within student nurses. Concluding that e-learning has a top-down institution-led development that is contrary to the student-led development espoused by universities.

%X Background and Aims: Self-treatment with intravenous infusion of clotting factor-concentrates is a practise unique to haemophilia patients. Adequate education of patients and their carers is required. In the Netherlands, 82% of severe haemophilia patients and 32% of moderate haemophilia patients treat themselves at home. The advantages of home treatment are evident and wellknown and have been reported in numerous publications. Since 2002 approximately 300 patients in the Netherlands followed a training program for self-treatment with the help of an instruction book “Home treatment, how to inject yourself ”, edited by the Dutch Association of Haemophilia Nurses (NVHV). We evaluated this program for its advantages and limitations by using Kolb's 'cycle of learning' theory. Materials and Methods: A detailed instruction book, used to educate approximately 300 patients, covers all aspects of haemophilia, divided into 5: diagnosis and treatment of bleeding, clotting factor concentrates, complications of treatment and technique of administration. This obligatory course generally takes 3-6 months and consists of weekly training sessions with instructions and practice with intravenous injections. The 4 stages in Kolb's 'cycle of learning' were used to analyze the suitability of our educational instrument: planning, acting out, reflecting and relating back to the theory. Results: With the use of the 4 stages of Kolb's model, 85% of the hemophilia nurses evaluated the educational program as valuable. Fifteen percent found missing and outdated information in the instruction book. Therefore, an update of the instruction book and an e-learning version were developed. After the specific training, patients were able to treat themselves at home, in a responsible way. This was seen by observations in daily practice. Conclusions: Due to the training program patients are able to convert knowledge into action. A structured innovative educational program, evaluated by a learning theory, ensures quality of care in haemophilia patients who are initiating home treatment.

%X Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a two-fold risk of developing Type 2 diabetes compared with the general population and their outcomes are poorer than for people who have diabetes alone. Aims/objectives: To explore factors that influence mental health professionals' management of diabetes in people with SMI. Methods: A link to an anonymous online survey was distributed to staff working in NHS trusts and publicised through professional organisations and social media. Results: The survey was completed by 103 mental health nurses and 93 psychiatrists. Management of diabetes in people with SMI was considered to be as important as managing their mental health by 92.7% of participants. The majority of participants saw it as part of their clinical role to provide advice about weight management (86.3%), general diabetes education (56.5%) and to check blood pressure (64.8%) but fewer reported it was part of their role to check cholesterol (41.3%), kidney function (33.6%), feet (16.1%) or to refer to retinopathy screening (12.6%). Reported barriers to managing diabetes included lack of training and confidence, with only 41% feeling confident in managing diabetes and 59.1% feeling worried about doing so. Specific training in diabetes had been received by 31.6% of participants and 70.7% felt that they needed more training. Conclusions: Mental health professionals consider basic elements of diabetes management to be an important part of their role. Although they take responsibility for some aspects of diabetes care, they also report a need for more training.

%X OBJECTIVE: Patients receive information about IVF and elective single embryo transfer(eSET) from multiple sources. Our objective was to determine which information channels are most associated with the choice of eSET and other related treatments. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of online survey results from a crosssectional sample of U.S. community women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey, advertised through RESOLVE (the National Infertility Association) was conducted over 5 weeks in 2014. Interested participants were screened for gender and cycle eligibility and gave consent by acknowledging an online privacy statement. Inclusion criteria were age < 40 and the completion of at least one cycle of IVF with embryo transfer. The outcome of interest was elective single embryo transfer (eSET, defined as multiple embryos available for transfer but electing a single embryo transfer) versus multiple embryo transfer (MET) in 1st cycle. Information sources were grouped into 3 'channels': in-person (MD, nurse, embryologist), print (handout, pamphlet), or online (webpage, social media). Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with X2 used for comparison of proportions among groups. RESULTS: Of 888 participants, 587 met age and cycle inclusion criteria. While 62% of participants used their smartphones to access the survey, most patients learned about IVF-related treatments from their IVF providers: 97% regarding numbers of embryos to transfer, 78% regarding maternal complications of multiple gestation, 78% regarding embryo morphology, 74% regarding fetal complications of multiple gestation, 63% regarding eSET, and 53% regarding PGD. Participants who underwent eSET and MET used the same number of information channels to select their IVF clinic . Those who underwent eSET, however, were more likely to have referenced printed (p=0.007) or online (p=0.012) sources about embryo transfer number. Participants who underwent eSET were also more likely to have been educated by in-person (p<0.001) or online (p=0.003) sources about eSET. The number of channels through which participants received information about embryo transfer number or eSET was directly correlated with choosing eSET, with higher numbers of channels being associated with higher rates of eSET (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our digital age, information about IVF and embryo transfer practices is often acquired through multiple information channels. These data suggest that patients who receive more education and utilize more channels for information acquisition may be more likely to choose eSET. Clinics should consider offering and encouraging patients to access multiple information channels to encourage the use of eSET; this information should also be accessible on a smartphone browser.

%X BACKGROUND: A subinternship is an opportunity for students to develop advanced clinical skills in preparation for internship. The Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) identified crosscoverage as a key component of the internal medicine subinternship, and previous medicine subinterns at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) rated exposure to cross-coverage poorly. The inability of students to give verbal orders makes this skill difficult for subinterns to learn by providing direct patient care; nurses usually bypass the students and call residents for these issues. Several barriers to curriculum implementation exist, including work hours, varied call schedules, and use of multiple clinical sites. CONTENT: Goals: 1. Provide cross-coverage instruction for medicine subinterns. 2. Create web-based distance learning simulations for students to practice cross-coverage skills. 3. Improve student self-assessment of preparedness for internship. In July 2009, a cross-coverage instructional primer and four web-based cross-coverage cases were implemented in the MCW internal medicine subinternship via a password-protected e-learning platform. Core topics from the CDIM subinternship curriculum were included: chest pain, respiratorydistress, acutepulmonary edema, fever, GI bleeding, andshock. DESIGN: Cases are presented sequentially; initially, basic data is given and students are prompted to answer several questions before moving to the next section. Each subsequent section provides information (history, physical, lab, imaging) that builds on the previous sections, and students answer questions based on this new data. Students formulate differential diagnoses, order and interpret diagnostic tests, create treatment plans, and write a cross-coverage note. Other topics addressed include critique of sign-out sheets, prioritization of on-call tasks, request of help from supervisors, and communication with consultants. After answers are submitted, the correct answers and teaching points are provided as feedback for review before advancing to the next section. EVALUATION: Students provide feedback in the course evaluation. Of the first fifty students to complete the cross-coverage cases, 88% agreed that “after completion of the cross-coverage cases, I feel more prepared for internship.” 66% reported becoming “familiar with the triage and assessment of common cross-coverage issues” during the subinternship, as opposed to 10% of students surveyed prior to implementation. Verbatim comments identified the short-answer question format, prioritization of duties questions, and case-mix as strengths of the cases. The cases were “an eye-opener” for some and “gave a lot of confidence” to others. Some recommended shortening the cases and allowing review of case data while writing the cross-coverage note. SUMMARY: In summary, these web-based simulations address an unmet need: teaching cross-coverage to subinterns as preparation for internship. As many schools require subinternships that share our challenges to curricular implementation, a distance learning approach seems optimal for this instruction.

%X Background: Educational and professional development should complement local, regional, national and international priorities in conjunction with clinical governance agendas. Infection Prevention and Control roles are increasingly diverse. Healthcare organisations require robust education and professional development systems to help practitioners gain the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes. In Forth Valley we aim to embed Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) education into learning at every level and across all professions. Aims and Objectives: HAI Education Strategy & action plan developed in 2008 and revised every 6 months included: Collaborative working with stakeholders including the NHS, universities and independent sector. Formal ward based education, audit and mentor roles for Cleanliness Champions. Infection Control team review of all local teaching programmes and on-line materials. Support for acute and community based learning initiatives. Working with NHS Education Scotland to enhance uptake of HAI e-learning modules. Results to date: .Cleanliness Champions support network with internet resources and two half days education per annum. .Regular multidisciplinary Study Days e.g. Sepsis Management event in January 2010. .Review of local nursing educational awards scheme has resulted in increased number of applications with clear criteria for submissions. .Contributions by clinical teams to local, national and UK wide HAI and Patient Safety educational consultations, study days and advisory panels. .Support and encouragement to colleagues and students to present their work; undertake learning activities, courses, research or publication. Discussion: Education and professional development is critical to ensure that infection prevention and health protection services are fit to meet the changing and challenging demands of working in the UK. Local resources need to be maximised and new technologies actively explored.

%X Introduction : Healthcare reform and advances in improvement science create new opportunities for anesthesia departments to lead perioperative efforts to learn, innovate, and improve outcomes. However, clinical demands and production pressure limit opportunities for caregivers from the intensive OR environment to interact in collaborative learning and improvement efforts. Our aim was to deploy and determine the departmental impact of a weekly anesthesia-led, interdisciplinary learning platform providing protected time, infrastructure, and resources for improvement in the OR environment. Methods : We launched Faculty Hour in 2010, uniting Anesthesia, Surgery, Nursing and others in improvement and professional development efforts at a large teaching hospital. OR start time is moved 30 min. later each Tuesday to provide protected time; a Steering Committee and Dept. Advisory Council guide efforts. Staff participate voluntarily at 6:45 am in 90-day chartered teams, combined anesthesia and surgery division meetings, and peer-led faculty development sessions. We surveyed faculty anonymously using an 11-item modification of a Baldrige assessment tool (2009) before and one year after launch to determine progress in organizational performance as a department in leading this effort. Chi square test was used for analyses. IRB exempted the study. Results : 44 of 69 faculty (63%) responded to the survey before and after starting the intervention. Marked improvement in organizational performance was noted overall (p<.0001) as well as gains in each individual item ranging from 9 to 38 percentage points. For example, faculty perceptions changed favorably in items regarding leadership, measurement, flexibility, and innovation. In the first 18 months, 114 anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses served on 12 chartered teams; 11 cross-disciplinary divisions met quarterly; and all anesthesia faculty participated in clinical innovation workshops and leadership, scholarship, and education development series. Teams achieved diverse aims such as improved patient flow, new patient-centered trauma care pathways, and monthly simulation-based, interdisciplinary OR team training. Counter-intuitively, on-time OR start rates are better on Tuesdays than any other day. Discussion : We have deployed a replicable model for interdisciplinary learning, innovation, and improvement in the OR environment. Faculty Hour engages anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and others in robust collaborative efforts, with high participation rates, striking evidence of change in organizational performance, and better care, learning, and efficiency.

%X BACKGROUND: Nurses and other allied health professionals are in a key position to provide appropriate and consistent advice on nutritional issues to support cancer survivors. However gaps in their nutrition knowledge and education warrant the need for enhanced learning as part of their Continued Professional Development (CPD). In the UK there are currently no formally recognised nutrition education programmes. Therefore e-learning offers a solution to provide flexible learning to target this need. AIMS: This study aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a freely available, internet-based learning resource, for nurses and allied health professionals who provide nutrition, diet and lifestyle advice for cancer survivors. It sought to explore the attitudes and conceptions of the resource and current knowledge base of those involved in the care pathway for cancer survivors. METHOD: The design and development of the e-learning resource were informed by the best available research and policy evidence and in a format to facilitate on-line learning. A robust evaluation strategy incorporated focus groups and telephone interviews to gain in depth insights into the experiences of using the resource. RESULTS: Themes included 'Plugging a Gap' which shows an improved knowledge base for nutrition. Information was 'All in One Place' showing that the resource was valued as being within a 'trusted' organisation. 'Everyone Benefits' illustrates how learners felt that the resource provided them with an evidence base, whilst the 'Current and Live' theme captured how professionals felt about the information being up-to-date. CONCLUSIONS: The project has shown the benefits of interprofessional working to develop an e-learning resource for Health Care Professionals to support cancer survivors in following healthier lifestyles. Positive attitudes and potential improvements in the knowledge base and changes for professional practice were demonstrated. Further research is required to gauge sustained impact in the work environment by embedding the resource as part of CPD.

%X Purpose of review Simulation's role in anesthesia education is expanding to include more advanced skills and training for subspecialty practice. This review will provide an overview of many recent studies that expand the simulation curriculum for anesthesia education. Recent findings Recent studies describe a curriculum that uses a range of simulation modalities, including part-task trainers, mannequin-based simulation, virtual reality, in-situ techniques, screen-based simulations as well as encounters with 'standardized' patients, nurses or physician colleagues. A variety of studies describe the use of task-training devises to more effectively acquire skills, such as fibre-optic intubation, ultrasoundguided regional anesthesia and transthoracic echocardiography as well as expand on a variety of teamwork skills particularly in subspecialty anesthesia practice. Summary A curriculum is emerging that utilizes a variety of simulation modalities as part of a more comprehensive educational strategy for anesthesia specialty training.

%X Objective: 1. Develop an educational experience involving learners from all ten healthcare professions faculties with the specific innovation being a de novo process that itself was interprofessional in nature. Background. Responding to a call for greater emphasis on interprofessional educational experiences in the curricula of healthcare professions faculties, a formal IPE competency framework was developed at our institution. Given the transprofessional nature of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes within the scope of hospice palliative care, this was viewed as an opportunity to develop an educational experience for learners addressing competency development in both hospice palliative care-related content and interprofessionalism. An IPE Palliative Care Working Group was formed and given the task of developing an interprofessional palliative care educational experience. Methods. Eleven faculty members (working group lead plus one rep from each faculty) with education as their academic focus and clinical background in hospice palliative care participated in the 2-year process. Faculties represented include medicine, nursing, social work, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, dentistry, speech language pathology, pharmacy, med rad sci, and physical education. The product was an innovative facilitated case-based interprofessional experience. Both mock pilot and formal pilot sessions were key elements of the process. Results. The general context for the session is a simulated interprofessional team meeting during which ten learners represent their respective profession. A dyadic model of facilitation is utilized with the overall purpose of the session being to prepare learners for a patient/family meeting during which care goals for a patient with advanced incurable disease are to be addressed. Given tremendous variation in professional program length (2-4 years) and curricular design for each of the ten faculties, it was determined “learner readiness level” for the session would be defined as “able to interpret, understand and communicate elements of a clinical assessment of their respective profession.” Two examples of learner objectives for the session are: (1) hospice palliative care-clarify the appropriate uniprofessional roles and interprofessional team approach to delivering care when the primary goal of care is to achieve and maintain quality of life as defined by the patient/family. (2) interprofesionalism-understand the role and contribution of each healthcare profession in the context of addressing goals of care for a patient/family. Discussion/conclusion. To effectively develop a de novo interprofessional educational experience, comprehensive interprofessional input and participation is required. Topics in hospice palliative care serve as an effective platform to teach skills in interprofessional knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

%X Aims: We aim to describe the current model(s) of diabetes care for UK university students (UUS) through a national survey of healthcare professionals (HCP) in university medical centres/GP practices (GPP) and diabetes specialist teams (DST). Methods: A comprehensive online survey was developed and sent to 220 sites. NVivo-10 software was used for the qualitative data analysis. Interim results: We received 170(88 GPP and 82 DST) completed questionnaires (77% response rate as of 1 October 2013).The responding GPP were spread across the UK, with 53% located within a university campus. Diabetes care was provided by named doctors (82.6%) and practice nurses (81%). There were no protocols for emergency care (62.5%), for insulin management (67%) or for diabetes in pregnancy (70.8%). In the DST survey, service/facilities provided included 'young person clinics'(89%), 'inpatient young person units' (6.8%), 'best practice tariffs' (53.5%), 'evening clinics' (29.2%) and'out-of-hours service' (27.8%).In both surveys, access to psychologist/counselling facilities was felt to be inadequate or not available (26.6% in GPP and 50.7% in DST). Only 32% of GPP and 32.4% of DST were aware of the 'You are Welcome' Department of Health quality criteria for young people. The biggest challenges identified were patient engagement, attendance, student lifestyle, ensuring continuity of care, communication between healthcare providers, patients' reluctance to change providers, and inflexibility of services. Suggested improvements were standardised national protocols for transitional care, better communication/coordination between providers/services, increased flexibility and accessibility of services. Conclusion: We have quantified areas of concern which will provide a platform for national policy makers to improve diabetes services for this at risk group in the UK.

%X Preceptorship/mentorship is designed to socialize students into the nursing profession, promote their confidence/competence and foster their critical thinking ability. In today's global context, opportunities exist for local, rural, national and international student placements which provide exciting and mutually rewarding preceptorship experiences. Despite the recognized value of those involved in preceptorship/mentorship, however, little progress has been made regarding the development of an infrastructure that effectively supports their ongoing education. This project, piloted from October 2008 to February 2009, leveraged our established research and teaching experience in preceptorship with technologies that allowed us to create an accessible and engaging e-learning space designed to support preceptors in a seamless fashion, improve the quality of the student preceptorship and enhance professional teaching capacity. A purposive sample of 25 preceptors was selected with a total of 18 preceptors successfully completing the five month program. Upon completion, participants were surveyed and individually interviewed. Data analysis revealed the program to be informative, supportive and highly valued. Knowledge derived from this study can: a) further enrich the substantive nature and infrastructure of online preceptor education; and b) contribute to clarifying best practices for preceptor support, facilitation, and ongoing professional development with a view to enhancing the preceptorship experience. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic information to be taught is the same but the level of detail will vary depending on the audience. The learning process usually involves progression from didactic lessons to skills training on inanimate models to supervised clinical practice. Modalities that may be used for skills training include cadavers, recently dead patients, videotapes, mannequins, simulators and virtual reality trainers. To maintain knowledge and skills, review and possible retraining should be conducted on an approximately annual basis.

%X Aim: Poorly functioning haemodialysis access is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing and developed world. We used our local experience to develop and implement a policy in North Sumatra, empowering selected experienced dialysis nurses to assess pre-dialysis patients and facilitate effective fistula function for established patients. Background: The Gold Coast and Medan, in North Sumatra, have been in a sister centre renal partnership since 2000. North Sumatra has 1300 haemodialysis patients and 100 on CAPD, but only 3 full-time nephrologists. There is no national reporting of vascular access outcomes; however, the proportion of patients dialysing via a native arterio-venous fistula is very low. Methods: A senior nurse from Medan visited the Gold Coast for two months, to identify processes appropriate for utilisation, and staff from both renal units modified tools and protocols for monitoring vascular access performance to suit the Sumatran environment. An education program was developed, utilising modified, Indonesian-translated nephrology educators network e-learning modules. One key nurse from each North Sumatran hospital underwent training and was given responsibility for coordinating fistula creation and monitoring. A senior Australian vascular access nurse later travelled to North Sumatra to run a one-week workshop for the key access coordinators. Results: This initiative shows an innovative solution to improving vascular access outcomes by adapting, and adopting, practices to suit the North Sumatran environment. Conclusions: Renal nurses in Medan have expressed increased confidence in their ability to act in a leadership role, facilitating timely and effective vascular access.We continue to collect data in the meantime to allow future evaluation of progress and identify other areas for improvement.

%X High-fidelity patient simulation is becoming an essential component of prelicensure nursing education. A survey was mailed to the boards of nursing in all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to ascertain the use of high-fidelity patient simulators for clinical time in current regulations. Participants were asked if high-fidelity patient simulation could be substituted for clinical time in the regulations and, if so, for what percentage. If not, they were asked whether they gave approval to nursing programs to substitute clinical time with high-fidelity patient simulators and, if so, for what percentage. Finally, the participants were asked whether they felt that the regulations would be changed in the future to allow the use of high-fidelity patient simulators to substitute for clinical time. Five states and Puerto Rico have made regulation changes to allow for such substitution, but only Florida has indicated a percentage of time. Sixteen states currently give approval for simulation substitution, and 17 states may consider regulation changes concerning high-fidelity patient simulation in the future. Such findings have implications for alterations in the prelicensure nursing curriculum that could examine patient safety and quality concerns addressed by the public and leading health and nursing organizations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we present a literature review of educational strategies for mental health in undergraduate nursing curricula and how these align with the recommendations of the Mental Health Nurse Education Task Force. We reviewed quantitative and qualitative research from 2005 to 2012. Twelve studies from Australia and elsewhere of different types of educational courses and strategies were included for this review. The key topics identified were in relation to a general overview of programmes outlining the content and outcomes, clinical placement strategies, involvement of consumers and mental health nurses in curriculum delivery and oversight, e-learning strategies, and implementation of mental health majors. Finally, limitations with considering the literature as a whole were highlighted, and recommendations made for future changes and research.

%X Background and Context: The Kuwait Cancer Control Center's (KCCC), Kuwait City, Kuwait, Vision is to “Achieve the best cancer care regionally and internationally”. In working toward this Vision, the KCCC Nursing department in collaboration with the UHN Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM), Toronto, Canada, Nursing department committed to making a significant contribution to cancer care in Kuwait by establishing an innovative education framework that develops specialized nursing knowledge, builds expertise in oncology care and provides leadership in evidence informed practice. Aim: To provide an oncology nursing education curriculum that builds a culture of inquiry, professional development and learner accountability. Strategy/Tactics: The UHN PM pathway is grounded in the Canadian Association of Nurses in Oncology (CANO) Core Competency Standards and embeds a novice to expert progression. Working in collaboration, KCCC and UHN PM nursing departments adapted this model to meet the needs of the local context and delivered an oncology nursing education program meeting international standards and integrated core components of cultural competence into its delivery. Programme/Policy Process: The specialized oncology nursing education pathway consists of twelve (12) workshops, 10 Oncologic Emergencies eLearning modules and 4 Specialized Skill certifications. The pathway provides nurses with a solid understanding of the multi-professional management of cancer patients and prepares them to be active participants in the inter-professional approach to patient care. Outcomes/What was learned: The specialized oncology nursing pathway provides a framework for delivering consistent and high quality nursing orientation and continuing education programs. It uses a learner centered approach and competency assessment method to meet the various learning outcomes required to develop KCCC oncology nursing into a specialized practice and also uses a systematic approach for ongoing education needs analysis, program planning and evaluation.

%X Currently, the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) is working with the Association of Canadian Academic Healthcare Organizations (ACAHO) to develop a joint position paper on patient safety cultures and leadership within Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs). Pressures to improve patient safety within our healthcare system are gaining momentum daily. Because AHSCs in Canada are the key organizations that are positioned regionally and nationally, where service delivery is the platform for the education of future healthcare providers, and where the development of new knowledge and innovation through research occurs, leadership for patient safety logically must emanate from them. As a primer, ACEN provides an overview of current patient safety initiatives in AHSCs to date. In addition, the following six key areas for action are identified to ensure that AHSCs continue to be leaders in delivering quality, safe healthcare in Canada. These include: (1) strategic orientation to safety culture and quality improvement, (2) open and transparent disclosure policies, (3) health human resources integral to ensuring patient safety practices, (4) effective linkages between AHSCs and academic institutions, (5) national patient safety accountability initiatives and (6) collaborative team practice.

%X Objectives: To study the current practice of computer use in musculoskeletal health professionals for their education and that of their patients. Methods: A survey questionnaire, designed by a working group including representatives from Arthritis Research UK and the British Society for Rheumatology, was made available on surveymonkey.com and the link distributed by email. Results: 190 health professionals responded. Rheumatology professionals made up two thirds of the participants. The modal age group of responders was under 40 years (37%). 97% had spent some educational time on a computer. Females were younger and spent more time using the computer for education purposes. The preferred learning modality was interactive online content (71%). The most common methods of educating patients were the Consultant and Specialist nurse while the web is used by 40% of the health professionals. The most common barrier to education was 'Insufficient resources for education groups'. Rheumatologists were more likely to log Continuous Professional Development (CPD) online, complete online modules and have mandatory training online. UpToDate and Arthritis Research UK were the highest rated websites for health professional and patient education respectively. Conclusions: This is the first national survey of E-learning in the musculoskeletal health profession, with a large proportion of Rheumatologists. Almost all use computer based learning. Use of the internet for patient education is low. Highly rated educational websites are available for both professionals and patients. © Nicolaou et al.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Self-management support is an essential component of the Chronic Care Model yet is often unavailable in primary care settings or limited by staff availability and reimbursement. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): The objectives of the program are to improve selfmanagement and support team-based care through the use of cell phone technology and remote case managers. Using diabetes as a model chronic disease for our initial pilot, we also aim to improve glycemic control. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): CareSmarts is a mobile phone-enabled care management program developed for individuals with chronic illness. It is fully funded by the University of Chicago Health Plan (UCHP) and currently offered to individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who receive primary care at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC). The program was designed to address key barriers to care management including patient engagement, limited clinician availability, and integration with primary care. CareSmarts is theory-driven and leverages social support, selfefficacy, and health beliefs to promote behavior change. Eligible patients are enrolled over the phone by nurse-case managers at UCHP. Through CareSmarts, patients receive automated text messages on their personal mobile phones consisting of educational messages and reminders. They text back self-assessments that enable nurse-case managers to provide between-visit support. For example, if a patient texts that she is currently out of her medications, an alert is triggered that prompts the nurse-case manager to contact the patient. Nurse-case managers then communicate with the primary care team via email to coordinate next steps. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): The primary outcome measure is pre-post changes in glycemic control (HbA1c). Secondary outcome measures include self-care measures and healthcare utilization and costs. Finally, we collect bimonthly feedback from health plan administrators and clinic staff on program implementation. FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE “FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED”): Ninety-one percent of physicians agreed to have their patients contacted for enrollment. Approximately one in five eligible patients agreed to participate and since May 2011 retention is over 95 %. Between enrollment and 3 months, improvements were observed in medication adherence (Morisky scale, p=0.00) and selfreported exercise (p=0.04) and foot care (p=0.01). Weekly timesheets suggest that 1 full-time-equivalent (FTE) can manage 350-400 patients. Nurse-case managers at UCHP value the opportunity to be involved with patient outreach while fulfilling their administrative responsibilities. Primary care physicians welcome having additional support for patient education and case management, which integrates into primary care yet does not require them to learn a new technology or modify clinic workflows. KEYLESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHATCAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Mobile technology, as a widely used communication platform, can be effectively used to provide self-management support and enhance team-based care. Mobile phone-based programs should strengthen traditional patient-provider communication and be integrated with primary care. Our practice innovation is designed for typical outpatient practices but incorporates remote monitoring from trained health professionals (e.g., MA or LPN). The growing trend towards care coordination, primary care medical homes, and accountable care organizations may enable widespread diffusion of this model.

%X BACKGROUND: Social media have become a popular communication system that has transformed communication from the traditional to the Web-based model. Because social media use has no limitations to place and time, it is now used extensively at clinical facilities. Social media useis becoming a popular activity amongst students at Nursing Education Institutions (NEI) in South Africa. However, lack of accountability and unethical use of social media by nursing students in South Africa has been reported. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to explore and describe the perceptions of nursing students regarding responsible use of social media. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive, explorative and contextual research design was used to explore and describe the perceptions of nursing students regarding the responsible use of social media. Twelve nursing students registered for the undergraduate nursing degree were purposely selected and interviewed individually using a semi-structured interview method. RESULTS: The results of this research study demonstrate that nursing students use socialmedia irresponsibly. Nursing students experience blurred boundaries between personal and professional lines and lack accountability when using social media. CONCLUSION: The extensive use of social media in the clinical environment, by healthcare students, requires a joint effort by Nursing Education Institutions and healthcare facilities to ensure that social media are used in an ethically acceptable manner. The implementation of the recommendations of this research study could positively influence legally and ethically acceptable use of social media at healthcare facilities.

%X Aim: To determine whether an e-learning resuscitation programme was able to improve the knowledge and competence of doctors and nurses in providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation to children in a simulated cardiac arrest. Method: A prospective before and after pilot study comprising of a simulated paediatric resuscitation before and after participants undertook an e-learning programme. Participants were emergency department doctors and new graduate nurses from The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Australia. Primary outcome measures were the ability to perform successful basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) according to published guidelines. Secondary outcome measures were the individual steps in performing the overall resuscitation and subjective feedback from participants. Results: Fifty-six clinicians were enrolled in the study (29 doctors and 27 nurses). Thirty-seven were re-tested (25 doctors and 12 nurses). The mean time between tests was 49 days (17 standard deviation). The e-learning module led to an improvement in participants' ability to perform BLS by 51% (P < 0.001) and ALS by 57% (P= 0.001) overall resulting in an overall competence of 89% (BLS) and 65% (ALS). There were also significant improvements in time to rhythm recognition (P= 0.006), time to first defibrillation (P= 0.009) and participants' self-reported knowledge and confidence in BLS and ALS (P < 0.001). Conclusions: E-learning does improve both the knowledge and competence of doctors and nurses in providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation to children in the simulation environment. © 2011 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

%X Aim A key competency for all health-care workers (HCWs) who care for children is the ability to respond to a child in respiratory or cardiorespiratory arrest. However, evidence suggests that medical and nursing staff may not have the knowledge and clinical skills to respond to these emergencies. The aim of this project was to create a standardised, evidence-based, paediatric life support course that would be available free to all HCWs in New South Wales (NSW), including NSW Ambulance. Methods A paediatric life support course was designed along current education principles. It used e-learning as pre-learning and a face-to-face short practical course, combining team work and communication with practical paediatric resuscitation skills training. The programme was designed to empower local trainers to deliver a standardised course to local participants. Results A total of 14?000 participants have completed the mandatory e-learning component, and over 8600 participants have completed the short practical course, across all NSW Local Health Districts, including NSW Ambulance. RESUS4KIDS has also been adopted by the universities of Sydney and Newcastle undergraduate medical and nursing programmes. Outside of NSW and ACT, over 400 participants have completed the course in facilities in Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory. Conclusion We have developed a course that is available, at no cost to individuals or facilities, to all HCWs in NSW, including students, paramedics and general practitioners. We would encourage all other jurisdictions to consider adopting the programme. © 2013 The Authors.

%X RESUS4KIDS is a project funded by NSW Health with the aim of designing and implementing a paediatric advanced life support course for healthcare workers that could be run throughout the Western Child Health Network (WCHN). The course comprises an elearning program as pre-learning and a short practical course. The e-learning has a post-course multiple choice question module that serves as the knowledge test. The short practical course is comprised of a thirty minute communication/teamwork session followed by a sixty minute scenario based, pause and discuss format practical session during which each candidate demonstrates each skill. The course was piloted in 2009, rolled out in the WCHN in 2010-11 and was revised and updated in December 2010 in accordance with the new Australian Resuscitation Council Guidelines. The course was evaluated using participant data and anonymous course feedback (164 responses). Since February 2011 over 1200 candidates have completed the e-learning and 500 completed the short practical course (68% nursing, 12% medical and 20% students). Roll out is dependent on a train the trainer model and over 160 trainers now exist over all three Child Health Networks. Particular relationships have been formed with the Centre for Rural and Remote Education in Broken Hill, the Northern Sydney Local Health District and the Child Health Network Clinical Nurse Consultants to promote the project in their areas. Funding is currently being sought from NSW Health to establish RESUS4KIDS as a State wide initiative.

%X OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the use of high fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) in paediatric intensive care nursing education through the use of a systematic literature review. METHOD: A systematic search was undertaken in the electronic databases CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), Medline and Pubmed, ClinicalKey, Science Direct and OVID. Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searches of journals, individual article reference lists and the World Wide Web. Main outcome measures were learner outcomes. The search was limited to papers published in English between 2000 and 2015. RESULTS: Eight papers satisfied the inclusion criteria of the review. Studies included in the review ranged from moderate to low on the quality assessment scale. HFPS training was associated with improved short-term learner outcomes of various measures, however this should be considered with the small number of studies examining this topic and the scarcity of high quality randomised studies. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of improved learner outcomes following HFPS training in paediatric intensive care (PICU) nursing education should be considered together with the quality and methodological limitations of existing research. There was no evidence of negative effects. The direction of research suggests that HFPS is a useful tool in the education of PICU nurses.

%X Identifying and stabilising deterioration in a child with significant clinical compromise is both a challenging and necessary role of the paediatric critical care nurse. Within adult critical care research, high fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) has been shown to positively impact learner outcomes regarding identification and management of a deteriorating patient; however, there is a paucity of evidence examining the use of HFPS in paediatric nursing education. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HFPS on nurses' self-efficacy and knowledge for recognising and managing paediatric deterioration. Further, participants' perceptions of the learning experiences specific to the identification and management of a deteriorating child were also explored. Registered nurses working in a tertiary-referral paediatric critical care unit were recruited for this quasi-experimental study. Using a pre-test/post-test control-group design, participants were assigned to one of two learning experiences: HFPS or standard instruction. Following the learning experience, nurses were also invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. 30 nurses participated in the study (control n=15, experiment n=15). Participants in the HFPS intervention were most likely to demonstrate an increase in both perceived self-efficacy (p=<0.01) and knowledge (p=<0.01). No statistically significant change was observed in control group scores. The mean difference in self-efficacy gain score between the two groups was 5.67 score units higher for the experiment group compared to the control. HFPS also yielded higher follow-up knowledge scores (p=0.01) compared to standard instruction. Ten nurses participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of the interview data identified four themes: self-awareness, hands-on learning, teamwork, and maximising learning. The results of this study suggest that HFPS can positively influence nurses' self-efficacy and knowledge test scores specific to the recognition and management of paediatric deterioration.

%X The world is shrinking due to the expansion of information technology, the ease of international travel, and the vast reach of the internet and social media. Technology has “leveled the playing field” and made it possible for more people from all over the world to collaborate and compete on equal footing than ever before. This is important for the team sport of transplantation as well, perhaps even more so. Contributions from transplant surgeons, physicians, scientists, educators, and innovators of all nationalities, ethnicity, colors, race, origin, and gender can all compete and play. ASTS and our transplant community has the opportunity to transform training so that it is a universal and global product. Many major transplant centers are no longer Euro- or U.S.-centric. Many are doing transplants at a much higher rate than we do, with the greatest growth in the last 10 years outside the U.S. Training the world can be done on many levels. First, via the traditional ASTS fellowship training programs. Second, bringing international visitors to our centers for observerships. Third, travelling to other countries to share knowledge and best practices. Finally, virtually via teleconferences and other web-based learning initiatives. Fellowship training. Most ASTS training programs have trained fellows from around the world. At last year's Fellows Symposium, there were trainees from 18 different countries who have trained at many of our 60-plus different North American programs. We know that 20-30% leave the U.S. for a transplant job in another country. The future direction of ASTS is to not just train transplant surgeons to work at U.S. programs, but to train the best transplant surgeons to build, develop, and grow quality programs around the world where expertise and knowledge is needed. Our training programs can also partner with international programs that meet the high ASTS standards of training and have teleconferences, share research initiatives, and participate in ASTS events, and facilitate clinical exchange programs to enhance experience in certain areas. Not just to learn surgical techniques but to also experience how things may be done differently-anywhere from organ donation initiatives, transplant center infrastructure, business practices, and how to do more with less. Observerships. Our center has developed international partnerships in several parts of the world, which are a combination of clinical, educational, and scientific collaborative efforts in both transplant and end-stage organ disease. We have visited them for CME courses and to learn about their needs and infrastructure, and they have sent many young professionals to our center to observe: surgeons, hepatologists, nurse coordinators, anesthesiologists. We have put in place a structure so as to make it as streamlined as possible, and to make it as rewarding as possible. We have developed international databases so that we can see if how something works in the U.S. also works in India or Korea. We are helping to train them, but we are also recipients of knowledge from our international friends. International visits. Many of us have trained clinical and research fellows from all over the world and met many international transplant surgeons and physicians at meetings. These interactions have made our clinical and research programs all the more rich and productive, providing us with unique collaborative opportunities and prospects. This networking provides a connection to be able to travel in many areas of the world to personally experience the rapid growth and development of transplant programs outside of the western world. Much can be learned from these visits. Teleconferencing and education. Technology can be the greatest tool for education and sharing of experience and immediate communication. The development of educational materials for the web and the participation in teleconferences can be a rich addition to training and advancement of the field of transplantation. Learning goes both ways. “Glocalization” describes a new outcome of loca co ditions toward global pressures - “the simultaneity-the co-presence-of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies.” A global product is transformed in shape in order to meet the needs of local consumers. ASTS can transform transplant training to meet the needs of the international community. If we want to train the world, we need to recognize that our transplant surgical training must continue to evolve so that it can reach the far corners of the world.

%X Introduction: Multidisciplinary rounds (MDRs) provide a platform for the interprofessional team to establish treatment priorities, coordinate care and effect discharge planning. However, there is limited understanding of its perceived educational value among different members of the interprofessional team. We studied how different healthcare professionals perceive the clinical utility and the educational value of MDRs in an acute geriatrics ward. Methods: We surveyed 78 members (34.6% doctors, 30.8% nurses, 33.3% allied health professionals). The questionnaire comprised demographic variables and satisfaction with the clinical utility and educational value of MDRs measured on a 5-point Likert scale (5 = very satisfied/important, 1 = not satisfied/important). To further elicit their views, we interviewed 55 members of MDRs. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using SPSS statistics programme and Nvivo respectively. A total of 235 pages of transcribed interview data were analysed thematically. Results: There was a significant misalignment in perceived clinical utility compared to perceived educational value [mean (SD): 4.32 (SD = ±0.78) vs 3.68 (SD = ±0.78), P <0.05)]. Analysis of qualitative data revealed distinct differences in perceptions of educational value across professional groups and level of seniority. When describing the perceived educational value of MDRs, allied health professionals expected to learn more cross-disciplinary knowledge; senior doctors and nurses emphasised acquisition of soft skills and teamwork skills; whereas junior doctors and nurses placed a premium on domain-specific learning. Discussion & Conclusion: We noted an interesting dissociation between perceived educational values with clinical utility. This misalignment appears to be attributable to differences in perception of educational value across professional groups and seniority.

%X Objectives: Cerebral stroke causes a significant deterioration of the patient's functioning and a worsening of her/his quality of life. Disability caused by stroke is common problem in all countries. The main aim of the comprehensive rehabilitation post-stroke is to minimize impairments, restore functional mobility, and return individuals to their life roles. The last one means improving quality of patient's life. Methods: Stroke rehabilitation has undergone a revolution over the last decade. Current understanding of brain plasticity has led to new approaches in ischemic stroke rehabilitation. Stroke units that combine good medical and nursing care with task-oriented intense training in an environment that provides confidence, stimulation and motivation significantly improve outcome. Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are applied in rehabilitation of motor function. Results: Methods based on multisensory integration of motor, cognitive, and perceptual processes including action observation, mental training, motor imagery and virtual reality are being tested. Different approaches of intensive aphasia training were described. Functional neuroimaging and animal models have unveiled the mechanisms underlying functional recovery and helped teams understand its limitations and improvement modalities. Conclusions: Recent neuroscience discoveries constitute the grounds needed to understand the emergence of new technologies: bi-lateral arm training (BAT), mirror therapy (Mirror Visual Feedback), robotics, exoskeletons, constraintinduced therapy (CIMT), gait training with partial body-weight support (PBWS) and virtual reality. In review presentation the principles and methods of contemporary rehabilitation post-stroke will be presented.

%X Modern handheld devices and wireless communications foster new kinds of communication and interaction that can define new approaches to teaching and learning. Mobile learning (m-learning) seeks to use them extensively, exactly in the same way in which e-learning uses personal computers and wired communication technologies. In this new mobile environment, new applications and educational models need to be created and tested to confirm (or reject) their validity and usefulness. In this article, we present a mobile tool aimed at self-assessment, which allows students to test their knowledge at any place and at any time. The degree to which the students' achievement improved is also evaluated, and a survey on the students' opinion of the new tool was also conducted. An experimental group of 20- to 21-year-old nursing students was chosen to test the tool. Results show that this kind of tool improves students' achievement and does not make necessary to introduce substantial changes in current teaching activities and methodology.

%X Control of blood glucose concentration for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has been demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing mortality and the incidence of serious complications, for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. However, the high degree of variability and uncertainty characterizing the physiological conditions of critically ill subjects makes automated glucose control quite difficult; consequently, traditional, nurse-implemented protocols are widely employed. These protocols are based on infrequent glucose measurements, look-up tables to determine the appropriate insulin infusion rates, and bedside insulin administration. In this paper, a novel automatic adaptive control strategy based on frequent glucose measurements and a self-tuning control technique is validated based on a simulation study for 200 virtual patients. The adaptive control strategy is shown to be highly effective in controlling blood glucose concentration despite the large degree of variability in the blood glucose response exhibited by the 200 simulated patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X Pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) is moving toward becoming an American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) subspecialty, roughly a decade after its formal inception in 2003. Education has played a central role as the field has evolved. Hospitalists are needed to educate trainees, medical students, residents, fellows, and nurse practitioner and physician assistant students in inpatient pediatric practice. Continuous professional development is needed for hospitalists currently in practice to augment clinical skills, such as providing sedation and placing peripherally inserted central catheter lines, and nonclinical skills in areas such as quality improvement methodology, hospital administration, and health service research. To address the educational needs of the current and future state of PHM, additional training is now needed beyond residency training. Fellowship training will be essential to continue to advance the field of PHM as well as to petition the ABP for specialty accreditation. Training in using adult educational theory, curriculum, and assessment design are critical for pediatric hospitalists choosing to advance their careers as clinician-educators. Several venues are available for gaining advanced knowledge and skill as an educator. PHM clinician-educators are advancing the field of pediatric education as well as their own academic careers by virtue of the scholarly approach they have taken to designing and implementing curricula for unique PHM teaching situations. PHM educators are changing the educational paradigm to address challenges to traditional education strategies posed by duty hour restrictions and the increasing drive to shorten the duration of the hospitalization. By embracing learning with technology, such as simulation and e-learning with mobile devices, PHM educators can address these challenges as well as respond to learning preferences of millennial learners. The future for PHM education is bright. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X Objectives: As a leading cause of death and disability, traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires ongoing surveillance. Further research is needed to understand factors associated with pr versus healthier outcomes following TBI to enable the most effective treatments to be developed and delivered. As a provincial trauma centre, St. Michael's Hospital specializes in the acute care of patients who have sustained TBI. Moreover, the outpatient Head Injury Clinic (HIC) manages 800 new patients (over 2000 patient visits) with TBI per year. This study developed the clinical database in order to (a) standardize the approach to care of patients with TBI at the clinic, (b) enhance efficiency of care by eliminating duplication of efforts made by staff, clinicians and patients, (c) enable the assessment of who is using the services and (d) provide a quality platform for future research. Methods: The overarching socio-ecological framework in the HIC guided selection of clinician and patient reported variables which were largely derived from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs), TBI Models Systems, the Consensus statement on concussion in sport and the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation (ONF)-Guidelines for Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury & Persistent Symptoms (2nd Edition). Injury characteristics are collected via a clinical interview (nurse or physician) including the CDEs of geographic location of patient residence, mechanism of injury, loss of consciousness, retrograde and anterograde amnesia. A self-report patient questionnaire captures the CDEs of personal and family history, associated injuries and immediate post-injury care. Symptoms measures are obtained from the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire as recommended by NINDS and the ONF guidelines. Determinants of health include education, occupation, from the NINDS-CDEs, while country of origin, cultural background and language spoken are questions from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Type of dwelling, living arrangements and income originate from the TBI Model Systems questionnaire, as does substance use prior to injury (tobacco, drugs and alcohol). This team added the Adverse Childhood Event to the patient's first HIC visit. The quality-of-life measure is the Euro Qol EQ-5D, NINDS recommended. Results: Building templates on core and clinically relevant data elements has been challenging, mainly in the quest to seek to collect too many variables. This study has managed to limit the collection of data elements by planning a programme of research. For patients who return to the clinic, the authors continue to track changes to symptoms, determinants of health and qualityof- life. Conclusions: Lessons learned will provide guidance as one broadens surveillance of TBI in a wider hospital community (such as in the emergency department and family practice clinics).

%X Wound care is an area of clinical practice and research that lends itself to international collaboration. With the growth of social media, video conferencing, Skype™, and other forms of virtual communication, it has never been easier for clinicians to communicate with one another and become immersed in collaborative research and the sharing of best practice. This article highlights areas where collaboration can take place effectively on an international scale. Such international partnerships can encourage the sharing of best practice, with new techniques being developed as a consequence. The authors share their experience of an effective collaboration between nurse academics based in the UK and Australia.

%X PURPOSE: An important component of the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) educational program involves anticipatory guidance for students assimilating the CNS role. This article describes a strategy for facilitating this transition through online discussion about CNS practice among students and experienced CNSs. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS: Six students in the final semester of their CNS program and 5 CNSs from across the country used the WebCT platform to participate in an online learning experience. This article outlines the process of structuring an online discussion, soliciting an expert panel, and preparing the participants. Students' concerns and panelists' responses are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Themes that emerged from students' questions to the panelists were certification and title protection; developing a career trajectory, including tips for interviewing and negotiation; and current and future trends in CNS practice. Benefits to participants are described, as well as suggestions for using Web-based discussion in other applications.

%X We present our ongoing work on an enhanced surgical conference system with a technology of virtual reality (VR). We reported on a surgical simulation support system by using a technology of virtual reality last year. In the present time, while using our VR simulation system, we realized that many surgeons and nurses needed to see both a solid real image and a virtual image of the surgical operation at the same time. According to this reason we added a solid video system to our previous VR simulation system. The new system can display both real and virtual images on 100 inch wide screen and a console monitor of Onyx computer. The doctors can see both images with shutter glasses on the screen or console. We can now simulate various cancer surgery while watching the real solid surgical picture. We expect our enhanced surgical conference system to be beneficial for surgeons and nurses with limited experience to familiarize surgical procedures. The system could be also employed in planning a surgical procedure and educating medical staffs. Here we discuss about the aim of the system, current implementation, its limitations and its future directions.

%X Background/Case Studies: Patient simulations (SIM) have been used for teaching and training health care students and professionals. SIM are especially useful in medical subspecialties where emergency situations are likely to occur, providing a learning opportunity in a controlled environment. We describe the use of SIM to develop and evaluate a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) including turn-around-time (TAT) improvements for laboratory monitoring in a non-trauma pediatric hospital. Study Design/Methods: A multidisciplinary committee that included nurses, hematologists, critical care, surgeons, anesthesiologists, laboratorians and blood transfusion experts was created. The MTP has 4 parts 1)an O- RBC refrigerator close to the patient care area, 2) a defined blood pack of red blood cells (RBC) and components, 3) an emergency bleeding panel (EBP) designed to provide a hematocrit, platelet count and coagulation results within a goal of 30 minutes, and 4) structured communication between critical service areas. A blood coordinator role was created to assist with transfusion recommendations and communication. The MTP was tested using a BabySIM® (CAE Healthcare, Quebec, Canada). TAT was recorded for the critical time points. Each SIM was followed by a team debrief which informed subsequent versions of the MTP. Results/Findings: We performed 5 SIM in different locations: emergency department (ED), neonatal ICU, cardiac ICU, OR and transfer from ED to OR. The SIM provided recognition that provider and nurse training were needed about activation of the MTP, indications for component therapy, and laboratory monitoring of a bleeding patient. From a process perspective, the repeated practice events demonstrated an average of 5 min to active the MTP and 4 min to retrieve O- RBCs. The EBP process realized a TAT improvement from 41 to 22 min. It was discovered that communication with the blood bank (BB) presented some challenges, since it implied taking time out of patient care to provide information. A short form tool was introduced in the BB to facilitate discussion of only critical data. This streamlined communication allowed blood pack prep and transport to be complete in 30 min. Contrary to our predictions, the blood coordinator role demonstrated no clear benefits since at the time of the arrival the MTP was already activated. Thus, it was decided to move the assigned duties to the charge nurse, which improved work assignments and communication. Conclusion: For non-trauma pediatric hospitals where bleeding emergencies are rare, the use of simulations was an effective way to evaluate the clinical response, improve the MTP algorithm, recognize areas where training is needed and shorten the TAT of critical laboratory testing.

%X PURPOSE: Interprofessional education (IPE) is essential for preparing nurse practitioner (NP) students to provide care in a collaborative team environment. The combination of a virtual clinic and video conferencing designed for NP students to practice interprofessional collaboration has not been studied. This study examined students' perceptions of the virtual learning environment which was developed to improve interprofessional competencies. DATA SOURCES: A survey instrument developed to evaluate interprofessional practice competencies was administered to student participants from eight disciplines (n = 71) following eight video conference discussions of an elderly patient presentation in a virtual clinic. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of responses was significantly associated with interprofessional competency domain (p = .002). The distribution of responses was also significantly associated with discipline (p < .001). Participants rated the value of this activity positively. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A virtual clinic and video conferencing was an acceptable learning platform for students, which can be used to simplify IPE logistics. The roles and responsibility competency domain is perhaps the hardest for novices to grasp. Teaching meeting facilitation is a necessary part of IPE for NP students to be able to use these skills in the future.

%X The Dutch national patient safety platform developed a protocol for the preparation of intravenous medication; the Aseptic NonTouch Technique (ANTT). Use of ANTT on nursing wards has shown to reduce contamination of intravenous medication. Therefore it is dictated by the Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate that this technique has to be used at all departments in the hospital, including the operating theatre. However, because of the use of air treatment and operating theatre uniforms, the operating theatre cannot be compared with a nursing ward. In this study, the bacterial contamination of syringes prepared in the operating theatre by anesthesia nurses was determined. Design Simulation study Method 45 anesthesia nurses prepared 1000 syringes of 10ml bacterial culture medium, using their routine method of drawing up iv medication from vials. Turbidity in a syringe after culturing for 14 days at 30° C was used as evidence for bacterial contamination. Using questionnaires, nurses were interviewed in what degree their working method equals ANTTprotocol. We calculated how much extra time must be invested when using the strict ANTTprotocol in the operating theatre. Results Six syringes (0,6%) were contaminated. Normal dermal bacteria were identified in all syringes. The nurses who prepared the contaminated syringes worked similar manner as their colleagues. It takes an additional 54 minutes per day per operating theatre to work strictly using the ANTT technique. Conclusion Contamination rates of aseptic preparations in the OR are very low, and are as low as ANTT preparations in a GMPcertified hospitalpharmacy. Therefore it is legitimate to develop a modified ANTTprotocol for use in the operating theatre.

%X Purpose: As part of the WHO 'Safe Surgery Saves Lives' campaign, a surgical safety checklist was introduced worldwide in 2009. Studies have found implementation of such checklists significantly reduced mortality and morbidity. It is therefore assumed that this is applicable to interventional radiology (IR) procedures. A modified version of the checklist for IR was introduced in the UK composed of 29 checks (to be conducted before and after a procedure). We report the initial uptake of the checklists and changes made to improve compliance. Material and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted during 06/06/2010-06/07/2010 and 15/12/2010-31/01/2011 and all available WHO checklists were analysed. The correct site marking check was sub-analysed. Following the initial audit period, educational sessions, e-learning and departmental guidelines were introduced to improve compliance. A comparison of the two study periods was made to assess for an improvement in uptake. Results: Comparison of the two study periods (A vs. B) revealed; 47 of 104 (45.2%) vs. 106 of 125 (85.0%) of procedures had a WHO checklist recorded. Of these 2.2% vs. 49.5% had all 29 checks fully completed. 76.6% vs. 83.0% had the correct safe site marking appropriately recorded. Conclusion: The checklist is simple to complete, but involves a cultural change within busy IR departments to achieve 100% compliance. Initial poor uptake and resistance can be improved, by implementing changes similar to the ones outlined, and, in particular, empowering the nursing staff to lead and oversee its completion. A repeat study is planned to investigate potential errors avoided by implementing the checklist.

%X Background to the audit: The modified WHO surgical safety checklist for IR was introduced in the UK in 2010.We report the uptake of the checklist and changes made to improve compliance in our IR department. Standard, indicator and target: The target was to achieve a 100% completion of the checklist for all IR cases performed. Methodology: The audit cycle was repeated 3 times between 06/2010 and 6/2011. All IR procedures which required a WHO checklist were analysed. The correct site marking check was sub-analysed. Results of 1st audit round: 47 of 104 (45.2%) of procedures had a WHO checklist recorded. Of these 2.2% had all 29 checks fully completed. 76.6% had the correct safe site marking appropriately recorded. 1st action plan: Educational and feedback sessions were conducted, elearning and departmental guidelines were introduced to improve compliance. All IR team members were encouraged to be involved with completion of the checklist, with the nursing staff taking the lead. Results of 2nd round: The 2nd and 3rd audit cycles revealed; 106 of 125 (85.0%) vs. 224 of 237 (90.6%) of procedures had a checklist recorded. Of these 49.5% vs. 95.5% had all 29 checks completed. 83.0% vs. 100% had the correct safe site marking appropriately recorded. Between each study period there was a significant improvement (p <0.0001). 2nd action plan: The checklist has the potential to greatly improve patient care but involves a cultural change within busy IR departments to attain 100% compliance, which we will continue to work towards.

%X Background: Meta-analyses demonstrate that vitamin D reduces falls, and calcium and vitamin D reduce fractures in LTC residents. The objective of the ViDOS trial was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a knowledge translation (KT) intervention aimed at integrating evidence-based osteoporosis/fracture prevention strategies in Long-term Care (LTC) homes.Methods: We randomized 40 LTC homes in Ontario, Canada to intervention (n=19) or control (n=21) arms. Interdisciplinary teams (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians) in intervention homes participated in a 12-month multifaceted program. Key components were 3 interactive sessions facilitated by an Expert Opinion Leader (via webinar), audit and feedback, point-of-care tools, and action planning for quality improvement. Control homes received toolkits and optional webinars offered to all Ontario LTC homes. Primary outcomes were the proportion of residents prescribed vitamin D ≥800 IU/day (primary) and ≥500 mg/day of elemental calcium at 12-months. We examined differences between intervention arms in the proportion of all residents prescribed vitamin D/calcium using the generalized estimating equations technique assuming an exchangeable correlation structure. Unit of analysis was the resident; unit of inference was the LTC home. Analyses were age-sex adjusted. Prescribing rates and odds ratios (95% CI's) are reported. Results: After randomisation, 7 LTC homes in the intervention group declined to participate (operational issues); they were excluded. 4660 residents [mean 84.5 (SD 10.7) years] resided in the remaining 33 LTC homes [mean size= 180 beds (SD 80)] and at baseline the proportion of residents prescribed vitamin D (≥800 IU/day) and calcium (≥500 mg/day), respectively, were: 38.8%, 32.7% of residents in intervention homes and 41.9%, 34.8% in control homes. At 12-months, vitamin D (≥800 IU/day) was prescribed to 72.4% of residents in the intervention arm versus 49.4% in the control arm (OR 3.14, 95% CI: 2.23, 4.41); and calcium (≥500 mg/day) was prescribed to 45.5% of residents in the intervention arm versus 37.5% in the control arm (OR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.25). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that an interdisciplinary, multifaceted knowledge translation intervention significantly improved prescribing of appropriate vitamin D and calcium in the LTC setting.

METHODS: A survey of perspectives on the need for primary care medicine in dental education was distributed to all the deans of Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)-accredited dental schools in the continental United States for a total of 65 eligible schools. RESULTS: Of the 27 responses from the dental school deans, a majority of dental schools already had interprofessional collaborative practices at their schools, with collaborations with physicians and nurse practitioners being most common. Ninety-six percent of responders were supportive of integrating oral health and primary care to improve patient care and regarded primary care training for dental students as a potential method of improving patient care in dental education. CONCLUSION: As patient care involves multidisciplinary and interprofessional environments with a wide array of health care providers, curricular directions for dental school should explore an education model that incorporates the concepts of primary care medicine.

%X The use of high-fidelity human patient simulators (HPS) have been embraced by nursing education programs in the development of immersive clinical simulations despite the lack of research into a pedagogy or educational philosophy appropriate to guide this technology-based learning tool. In this article, we explore this approach to clinical teaching through a critical examination of the application of behaviorist and constructivist pedagogy to high-fidelity scenario-based simulation sessions. Practical guidelines for developing simulation-based learning sessions that reflect both philosophical paradigms are provided. Consideration is also given to societal trends such as the digital revolution and the incoming millennial generation who represent the aptitude of the modern nursing student to utilize high-fidelity realistic and immersive simulation. Depending on the desired goal of simulator utilization, the nurse educator may want to draw on constructivism or behaviorism or a blend of both educational philosophies to best meet the needs of the adult learner. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The use of the high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS)-based clinical scenario in undergraduate nursing education is a powerful learning tool, well suited to modern nursing students' preference for immersive construction of knowledge through the provision of contextually rich reality-based practice and social discourse. The purpose of this study was to explore the social-psychological processes that occur within HPS-based clinical scenarios. Grounded theory method was used to study students and faculty sampled from a Western Canadian baccalaureate nursing program. The process of leveled coding generated a substantive theory that has the potential to enable educators to empower students through the use of fading support, a twofold process composed of adaptive scaffolding and dynamic assessment that challenges students to realistically self-regulate and transform their frame of reference for nursing practice, while limiting the threats that traditional HPS-based curriculum can impose. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X Nurse educators are charged with the responsibility of empowering novice nurses to become autonomous thinkers with the capacity to cope with the many challenges of modern day practice. Human patient simulation is a powerful technology-based educational tool ideally suited for the application of emancipatory pedagogies that aid in the transformation of individual meaning schemes. Transformative learning theory provides educators with the tools to empower students to challenge their preconceived beliefs, assumptions, and values and socialize them appropriately to thrive in modern day clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to critically analyze the role of clinical scenarios using human patient simulation to promote transformative learning events in undergraduate nursing education. The authors focus on the role of debriefing in the promotion of the critical reflection and social discourse that is integral to the learning process and the implementation of scenarios that provide students with disorientating dilemmas for perspective transformation. © SLACK incorporated.

%X Aim To engage acute care clinicians in prioritizing professional issues of concern and to help them identify and design change projects. Background In order to meet and respond to challenges and to ensure safety, efficiency and positive patient and staff outcomes, it is imperative to understand the nature of difficulties faced by health professionals and for clinicians to be included in decision making and change. Method A three-phase mixed-method design utilizing descriptive and interpretive approaches. Data were collected via survey, focus groups and nominal group workshops. Results Communication, skill mix and work environments were identified as issues of most concern. Participants were able to identify and prioritize a range of projects to help them better understand and alleviate workplace problems. Conclusion This study highlights key directions for practice change and confirms previous findings identifying urgent need for research that aims to overcome poor communication and skill shortages. It differs from other studies by providing a platform for participants to design projects leading to solutions and participate in change. Implications for nursing management Support must be provided for managers in rostering, staffing, and resource procurement and allocation. The results of the present study highlights a need to refocus management styles on staff empowerment, participation and team building. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Human patient simulation provides students with experiences and skills they might not otherwise encounter in a clinical rotation. It also offers an experience during which the time is suspended, thus affording students time to think critically, make decisions, and act, as opposed to the fast-paced hospital environment where students may have neither a clear picture of the situation nor adequate time to act. This article presents the design of a simulation center within a school of nursing along with several areas of considerations for successful implementation of the laboratory. A simulation scenario focusing on the acute coronary syndrome used during a final semester critical care nursing course is described and student evaluation of the experience analyzed. The evaluation includes student assessment of the simulation process for the development of necessary patient care skills and the ability to test decision-making and critical thinking skills.

%X Background: With an increasing number of patients receiving oral cancer therapies, evaluation of safe prescription practices, effective patient education, and toxicity monitoring of these agents is imperative. Methods: Multi-disciplinary oncology practitioners at several cancer centres in Toronto, Canada were surveyed using a web-based platform, to evaluate their prescription practices, use of patient education and symptom management tools, as well as their views on patient adherence and toxicity reporting. Results: Of 170 respondents, 43% were nurses, 34% were pharmacists, and 23% were physicians. Seventy nine percent considered patient education, medication adherence (76%), and toxicity management (78%) as “very important”components of oral chemotherapy management. Prescription methods varied: 59% of respondents used written prescriptions, 39% computerized physician order entry (CPOE), and 0% pre-printed orders, ≥50% of the time. Clinicians felt that patients report side effects from oral agents only “some of the time”(53%), and the most problematic toxicities were nausea (61%) and diarrhea (61%). Practitioners perceived the most common reasons for patient underreporting of side effects to be “fear of treatment interruption”(62%), and that “toxicities are part of the treatment”(66%). Seventy three percent of those surveyed felt individual counseling, follow-up calls (69%), and updated medication information (57%) would improve patient adherence and safety. Conclusions: A diverse group of surveyed oncology professionals expressed the importance of utilizing educational and toxicity monitoring tools for patients on oral cancer therapies, particularly as patients are thought to under-report symptoms. Prescription practices are variable, and CPOE use should be improved. The results of this survey will also be compared to a patient survey, to help develop better tools and policies to standardize practice, and improve patient adherence and toxicity management on oral cancer agents.

%X The past decade has witnessed the increased use of patient simulation in medical training as a method to teach complex bedside skills. Although effective bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is a critical part of airway management, the quality of training in this skill has been questioned. First-year internal medicine house staff (novices) were used to evaluate a computerized patient simulator as a tool to teach difficult BMV. A novice group and an expert group (certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists) were tested to validate the simulator's ability to distinguish between these 2 skill levels. The difference between the novice and expert groups in the ability to perform difficult BMV was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Brief training for novices led to a 100% pass rate and competence as measured by the simulator. Simulation training was effective in increasing the ability to ventilate a simulated difficult-to-ventilate patient (P < 0.0001). This study suggests that this computerized patient simulator was validated as a simulation model for teaching difficult BMV and differentiating skill levels in BMV. Using the simulator with brief training on difficult BMV allowed new internal medicine house staff to successfully ventilate a simulated difficult patient.

%X Introduction: Cancer chemotherapy administration and care is high risk and complex, and as such, specialized knowledge and care is required within environmental that support quality practice. An education institute developed an innovative standardized chemotherapy and biotherapy course, and a competency maintenance program, in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The program reflects standards identified by a number of national and international bodies, and meets Cancer Care Ontario standards for chemotherapy delivery. Objectives: To review all components of an education program utilized for cancer chemotherapy nursing education, including development strategies, theoretical considerations and evaluation results for a 6 year period. Methods: Multiple modalities were utilized to implement the curricula and make it available across the country, including e Learning, videoconferences, workshops and an expert facilitator training program, addressing various learning styles and access issues. Results: Over 2000 nurses have completed the course since its inception. Program evaluation results will be shared for each component of the program, including participant demographics, prior knowledge and experiences in cancer care, and subjective and objective competency assessment parameters. Evaluation results indicate enhanced competency for participants completing the courses. Conclusion: Amultimodal approach to competency development and maintenance in cancer nursing care can address diverse learning needs across broad geographical areas, enhance patient safety and quality, and promote standardized, evidence based care.

%X BACKGROUND: Torture is widespread, with potentially broad and long-lasting impact across physical, psychological, social and other areas of life. Its complex and diverse effects interact with ethnicity, gender, and refugee experience. Health and welfare agencies offer varied rehabilitation services, from conventional mental health treatment to eclectic or needs-based interventions. This review is needed because relatively little outcome research has been done in this field, and no previous systematic review has been conducted. Resources are scarce, and the challenges of providing services can be considerable. OBJECTIVES: To assess beneficial and adverse effects of psychological, social and welfare interventions for torture survivors, and to compare these effects with those reported by active and inactive controls. SEARCH METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Specialised Register (CCDANCTR), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), the Open System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenSIGLE), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and Published International Literature On Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) all years to 11 April 2013; searches of Cochrane resources, international trial registries and the main biomedical databases were updated on 20 June 2014. We also searched the Online Library of Dignity (Danish Institute against Torture), reference lists of reviews and included studies and the most frequently cited journals, up to April 2013 but not repeated for 2014. Investigators were contacted to provide updates or details as necessary. SELECTION CRITERIA: Full publications of RCTs or quasi-RCTs of psychological, social or welfare interventions for survivors of torture against any active or inactive comparison condition. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We included all major sources of grey literature in our search and used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration for collecting data, evaluating risk of bias and using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Nine RCTs were included in this review. All were of psychological interventions; none provided social or welfare interventions. The nine trials provided data for 507 adults; none involved children or adolescents. Eight of the nine studies described individual treatment, and one discussed group treatment. Six trials were conducted in Europe, and three in different African countries. Most people were refugees in their thirties and forties; most met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the outset. Four trials used narrative exposure therapy (NET), one cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and the other four used mixed methods for trauma symptoms, one of which included reconciliation methods. Five interventions were compared with active controls, such as psychoeducation; four used treatment as usual or waiting list/no treatment; we analysed all control conditions together. Duration of therapy varied from one hour to longer than 20 hours with a median of around 12 to 15 hours. All trials reported effects on distress and on PTSD, and two reported on quality of life. Five studies followed up participants for at least six months.No immediate benefits of psychological therapy were noted in comparison with controls in terms of our primary outcome of distress (usually depression), nor for PTSD symptoms, PTSD caseness, or quality of life. At six-month follow-up, three NET and one CBT study (86 participants) showed moderate effect sizes for intervention over control in reduction of distress (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to -0.19) and of PTSD symptoms (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.07). However, the quality of evidence was very low, and risk of bias resulted from researcher/therapist allegiance to treatment methods, effects of uncertain asylum status of some people and real-time non-standardised translation of assessment measures. No measures of adverse events were described, nor of participation, social functioning, quantity of social or family relationships, proxy measures by third parties or satisfaction with treatment. Too few studies were identified for review authors to attempt sensitivity analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low-quality evidence suggests no differences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of immediate effects on post-traumatic symptoms, distress or quality of life; however, NET and CBT were found to confer moderate benefits in reducing distress and PTSD symptoms over the medium term (six months after treatment). Evidence was of very low quality, mainly because non-standardised assessment methods using interpreters were applied, and sample sizes were very small. Most eligible trials also revealed medium to high risk of bias. Further, attention to the cultural appropriateness of interventions or to their psychometric qualities was inadequate, and assessment measures used were unsuitable. As such, these findings should be interpreted with caution.No data were available on whether symptom reduction enabled improvements in quality of life, participation in community life, or in social and family relationships in the medium term. Details of adverse events and treatment satisfaction were not available immediately after treatment nor in the medium term. Future research should aim to address these gaps in the evidence and should include larger sample sizes when possible. Problems of torture survivors need to be defined far more broadly than by PTSD symptoms, and recognition given to the contextual influences of being a torture survivor, including as an asylum seeker or refugee, on psychological and social health.

It is impossible to read a newspaper, magazine or social media article without being exposed to dietary advice, nutritional research or the latest diet craze. It is essential that nurses are able to advise their patients on research-based UK guidelines for a healthy diet, and be able to respond to patient questions on diet-related matters, ensuring the information they give is not based on current media opinion or celebrity views. This paper summarises the evidence found within current guidelines to help nurses ensure their practice is evidence based. This will help meet the requirements of the Nursing and Midwofery Council's (2015) Code, including delivering fundamentals of care and being able to practise in line with best available evidence.

%X Innovation concept: High patient volumes are common at mass participation sporting events, concerts and music festivals. As highlighted at the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, unanticipated events can result in a mass casualty incident, requiring on-site emergency medicine (EM) and disaster response. The literature contains sparse reference to learner participation in mass gathering medicine (MGM) or disaster medicine (DM). Limited resources and unpredictable conditions at mass gatherings help prepare medical learners for challenges faced in emergency departments, mass casualty incidents, and disasters. Methods: A longitudinal and shift-based elective for EM residents and medical students has run at UBC since 2008. Residents complete event shifts under attending physician supervision, with each event shift 'equivalent' to an EM shift. Set in exciting, dynamic and sometimes austere inter-professional environments, learners are exposed to management of unique, acute presentations in the prehospital setting, and involved in operational and logistical issues in MGM and DM. Bidirectional evaluation addresses learning objectives consistent with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada CanMeds Physician Competency Framework. Curriculum, tool, or material: From 2008 to 2013, 61 residents and 126 medical students have participated in 77 MGM events. Based on five years of post-event participant survey data, the responses have been overwhelmingly positive and learner participation has enriched medical teams at numerous mass gatherings. Conclusion: The MGM elective provides a platform for physician training, serving as an introduction to MGM, community service, leadership, hands-on field experience, inter-professional team collaboration, emergency management and disaster planning. Given the important skill-sets attainable and the lack of formal MGM and DM training options for residents, expansion of elective and possible fellowship opportunities benefit both learners and the community. In light of the inter-disciplinary nature of MGM, this elective structure could be readily incorporated into other medical and allied health care training programs such as nursing, physiotherapy, paramedicine, and chiropractic schools.

%X Introduction: In the Anglo-BoerWar of 1899-1902 a new unit was added to the Order of Battle of national armies within the British Commonwealth. The Casualty Clearing Station was a newly-conceived medical unit, raised to blend features of the both a field ambulance and a stationary hospital. At the outbreak of World War I (4 August 1914) however, the stillevolving Medical Corps of both the Australian Army and the New Zealand Army had establishments for combat zone units only up to Field Ambulance level. Methods: Archival research at the AustralianWar Memorial. TheWar Diary of 1 Australian Casualty Clearing Station. Results: With great urgency, in October 1914, the No.1 Australian Casualty Clearing Station was raised as a volunteer force in Hobart. After seven weeks training, the unit embarked for Egypt and landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. It treated and evacuated 2731 surviving wounded soldiers in the first seven days of the ANZAC campaign. The CCS was the most forward unit in the casualty evacuation chain where emergency surgery, radiology, pathology, dentistry and skilled nursing care was available. Both Australian and New Zealand nurses trained as anaesthetists and served in British Casualty Clearing Stations. The CCS had some mobility but had a theoretical maximum 'Holding Policy' of 14 days. Australia raised three Casualty Clearing Stations in World War I. These and New Zealand Casualty Clearing Stations also served inWorldWar II. They were removed from the Order of Battle in 1976. Conclusion: The Casualty Clearing Station became a focus for new systems of casualty management; and a platform for new diagnostic modalities on operational service. Their history encapsulates a snapshot of six decades of service in the continuous evolution of military medicine.

%X Background: Historically, health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa have mainly managed acute, infectious diseases. Few data exist for the preparedness of African health facilities to handle the growing epidemic of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We assessed the burden of NCDs in health facilities in northwestern Tanzania and investigated the strengths of the health system and areas for improvement with regard to primary care management of selected NCDs. Methods: Between November, 2012, and May, 2013, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 24 public and not-for-profit health facilities in urban and rural Tanzania (four hospitals, eight health centres, and 12 dispensaries). We did structured interviews of facility managers, inspected resources, and administered self-completed questionnaires to 335 health-care workers. We focused on hypertension, diabetes, and HIV (for comparison). Our key study outcomes related to service provision, availability of guidelines and supplies, management and training systems, and preparedness of human resources. Findings: Of adult outpatient visits to hospitals, 58% were for chronic diseases compared with 20% at health centres, and 13% at dispensaries. In many facilities, guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and first-line drug therapy for the primary care of NCDs were inadequate, and management, training, and reporting systems were weak. Services for HIV accounted for most chronic disease visits and seemed stronger than did services for NCDs. Ten (42%) facilities had guidelines for HIV whereas three (13%) facilities did for NCDs. 261 (78%) health workers showed fair knowledge of HIV, whereas 198 (59%) did for hypertension and 187 (56%) did for diabetes. Generally, health systems were weaker in lower-level facilities. Front-line health-care workers (such as non-medical-doctor clinicians and nurses) did not have knowledge and experience of NCDs. For example, only 74 (49%) of 150 nurses had at least fair knowledge of diabetes care compared with 85 (57%) of 150 for hyptertension and 119 (79%) of 150 for HIV, and only 31 (21%) of 150 had seen more than five patients with diabetes in the past 3 months compared with 50 (33%) of 150 for hypertension and 111 (74%) of 150 for HIV. Interpretation: Most outpatient services for NCDs in Tanzania are provided at hospitals, despite present policies stating that health centres and dispensaries should provide such services. We identified crucial weaknesses (and strengths) in health systems that should be considered to improve primary care for NCDs in Africa and identified ways that HIV programmes could serve as a model and structural platform for these improvements. © 2014 Peck et al.

%X Aim: The National Inpatients Audit and Think Glucose Campaign raised concerns about inpatient diabetes care. We set out to establish whether this was related to lack of confidence and knowledge in healthcare professionals managing this patient group. Method: A questionnaire was sent to healthcare professionals working on two medical and two surgical wards in a busy district general hospital.The 20multiple choice questions were based onThink Glucose concepts. Answers were validated by diabetes specialists. Results: In all, 66 questionnaires were completed by 46 nurses, six doctors and 14 healthcare assistants. Scores ranged from 4.5 to 17; possible maximum was 23. A sub-analysis of nursing staff responses showed 16 of the 46 had not attended a diabetes teaching session in 5 years. 23 felt confident with managing diabetes but scores ranged between 9.5 and 15. 67 per cent identified at least one appropriate treatment for hypoglycaemia; interestingly 80 per cent of healthcare assistants recognised one appropriate treatment. Seventy-eight per cent of nurses knewthat peoplewith diabetes should have a foot assessment in hospital. The most alarming finding, especially since the publication of theRapid Response Report by theNational Patient Safety Agency in June 2010,was that only one nurse and one doctor recognised common errors in insulin prescribing. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals lack confidence and knowledge to manage inpatient diabetes. To address this a structured inpatient teaching programme has been designed, we have raised awareness of specialist support, rewritten management guidelines and encouraged staff to complete an insulin error e-learning module.

%X Aim: Insulin related drug errors are a significant source of adverse incidents in the inpatient setting [National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) 2010]. With the introduction of several new initiatives we hoped to demonstrate savings in insulin costs, reductions in waste and substantial improvements in safety. Method: There are three initiatives. Enhanced training: Insulin e-learning mandatory for all qualified nurses and an essential requirement for completion of drug competencies. Compulsory insulin training introduced for Foundation Year 1 doctors. An insulin guide introduced for use in all clinical areas. Savings and waste: Removal ofward insulin stock. Single insulin devices dispensed. Safety: Introduction of pre-prepared intravenous insulin infusions. Changes to insulin prescribing. The word 'insulin' must be written after the name, eg 'determir insulin'. Insulin dosemust be written inwords and figures. All doses must sayUnits notUand IU. Insulin device should be stated, eg flexpen. Results: Training - 220 trained nurses (40 per cent) have completed the insulin e-learning module. Savings - removal of ward stock and dispensing of single devices has produced a cost saving of 17 per cent over 1 year. Safety - insulin prescribing errors have fallen.Nine insulin errors were reported between July and September 2010. In the same period in 2011, there have been none. Conclusion: We have worked relentlessly to ensure that the Royal Surrey County Hospital is a safer place for our patients with diabetes. Wehavemanaged toimprovewardsafety andproduce a significant cost savings. We now hope to implement a self-administration policy and introduce a passport for our patients as per the NPSA alert (2011).

%X Background The Joint Commission (TJC) National Patient Safety Goal for Anticoagulation requires that hospitals provide education regarding anticoagulant therapy to prescribers, staff, patients, and families. Patients and families are required to be educated on the importance of follow-up monitoring, compliance, drug interactions, and adverse reactions. However, a University Health Systems Consortium (UHC) benchmarking survey of 31 academic medical centers conducted in 2009 found that only 12.5% of patients treated with warfarin had adequate documentation of counseling. As a result of this survey, we recognized a significant opportunity to improve our performance on this metric. Methods We restructured our pharmacy practice model in order to better meet TJC standards by creating a staff-pharmacist based warfarin counseling and medication reconciliation service. Work-shift overlap was augmented to allow two pharmacists up to 3 h of availability to perform warfarin counseling to hospitalized patients. An electronic dashboard was used to identify patients and to document counseling in the electronic medical record. Training methods included a web based in-service, individualized training, and competency assessment. Results 100% of assigned staff pharmacists (15/15) completed the online webinar, individual training, and competency assessment. Pharmacists in other areas also completed the webinar (75%, 37/49) and competency assessment (55%, 27/49). During a 2-month survey, the daily warfarin patient census ranged from 38-60 (median 47) with 5-20 new patients (median 13) added daily. Counseling documentation was achieved in 20-47% of patients during this time. Conclusion Percent of patients with documented counseling improved from baseline (0%) and exceeded the UHC national average (12.5%). Nurses and physicians continue to supplement the pharmacist provided counseling. There is need for continued growth of this pharmacist based service.

%X PURPOSE: Current practice in interventional pulmonology (IP) encompasses complex procedures that require a solid teamwork among team members including the IP nurse assistants (IPNA) and IP respiratory therapist assistants (IPRTA) to ensure an efficient workflow and patients' safety. However, there is currently no professional teaching platform that focuses on enforcing professionalism for specialized IPNA and IPRTA personnel. METHODS: A collaborative effort by expert IP tutors from three international large academic teaching institutions, under School of Respirology, have supported this one day course, to encourage open, interactive discussion along with concise background clinical instructions. The emphasis (75%) of this one-day course was allocated for hands-on self-performance sessions by nurse course participants themselves forming teams, while assisting tutor IPs and each other, on simulation mannequins which included stop and go scenario performance e.g. in airway foreign body removal, transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and management of massive hemoptysis. RESULTS: Assessment by the twenty nurse course participants showed that 80% approved this competency educational initiative as an excellent open platform with full adherence to the requirements of modern competency education they currently need. Twenty percent indicated that an integrative course together with mandatory participation of their own IP physicians should become institutionalized. Seventy percent agreed that mandatory passing of a theoretical examination before participation and post-course official examination audited by the international IP tutors, should be enforced. Official diplomas by the IP educational School of Respirology would be much appreciated for their professional status. However, 80% also indicated that they fully realized that this one-day IP nurse is insufficient for their level of competency. CONCLUSIONS: The results shown seem to match the necessity for synchronizing competency education with IP physicians, which should be organized by strong collaboration among the large academic teaching institutions to meet the modern requirements of competency education at all levels.

%X Background and objective: The importance of the role of a clinical pharmacist resident in the operating room during 6 months, in a private hospital belonging to a group devoted to healthcare for over 70 years. The hospital is recognized as a reference centre of excellence of hospital care in Portugal. It has 145 inpatient beds, two surgical blocks with 9 rooms and 12 beds in the Intensive Care Unit. The aim of the clinical pharmacist in the operating room is to ensure compliance with good clinical practice, safety and pharmacotherapeutic effectiveness, as well as optimization of drug costs. Design: 1. Logistics restructuring of pharmaceutical services and the need of the physical presence of the pharmacist in the operating room. 2. Furthermore, the workstation of the pharmacist is moved to the operating room and the in-depth study of all medicines used in the operating room. 3. In compliance with the Joint Commission, definition, optimization and adjustment of drug stocks to the needs of the service itself. In close collaboration with the nursing staff, consumer kits were created for registration of drugs by type of surgery in order to facilitate registration and ensure billing efficiency. Control of the analgesic drug's dispensation circuit in hospitalized surgical patients that stay less than 24 h in the hospital. Ensure compliance with the project through which the Health Regulatory Authority evaluates several hospitals in the country, creating a national ranking among hospital specialties. 4. Clinical phase: Creation of prescription protocols by type of surgical intervention based on national clinical guidelines. Validate prescriptions in the intra-surgical block in compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis, antiemetic and thromboembolic, checking deviations in therapy according to good practice. Identify pharmacologic hypersensitivities of patients by consulting the clinical process and anaesthesiology records. Provide information on drugs, drug efficacy monitoring and adverse drug reactions in risk management platform. Check off label use of drugs. Results: Of a total of 772 interventions, 360 relate to revenue optimization and 412 relate to clinical interventions. There was an increase of approximately 25% in billing. On what regards to clinical interventions, the majority of them showed deviations from good clinical practice. Conclusion: The physical presence of a clinical pharmacist in the surgical block is essential as the prescription and administration of drugs is carried out simultaneously, allowing immediate therapy validation, in order to increase the safety and efficacy. The pharmacist has the ability to interact with the multidisciplinary team, as well as monitoring the patient's clinical process, the pharmacotherapeutic profile and drug allergies, allowing the detection of any adverse drug reaction on-time. All these interventions are possible in the pre, intra and postoperative phases.

%X Current methods for addressing catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are mostly focused on the biological causes, emphasizing the adherence to prevention guidelines, collecting data and disseminating the results, as well as identifying emerging threats from infectious organisms. However, there is a need for tools that can help organizations to implement interventions in ways that maximize the benefits while minimizing the impact upon efficient operations. This research extends the current methods for addressing CAUTIs to a new level beyond the current state of practice by introducing a new discrete-event simulation model for system assessment and determination of the clinical efficacy of CAUTI preventive interventions. The simulation model provides a platform where proposed clinical interventions can be studied and analyzed; giving an idea of possible expectations before clinical research is conducted; saving time, money, and minimizing risks. The computational results provide useful insights into patient service management for CAUTI prevention and show that operational factors such as the nurse:bed ratio, catheter daily removal chance, and late maintenance risk have a significant impact in the intensive care unit CAUTI rate.

%X Introduction and Objectives: The explosion of robotic surgery (2500 Da Vinci robots installed worldwide) raises the question of the quality of surgeon training for this new technique, very different both from open and laparoscopic surgery. Currently the basic training is provided by INTUITIVE SURGICAL®. We report a 5 years experience of an innovative multidisciplinary and multimodal academic training program. Materials and Methods: This training is multidisciplinary and open to surgeons and operating room nurses. The program is multimodal and combines theoretical courses which are available in e-learning and practical training based on several progressive steps: training on 5 simulators dV-Trainer® (20 h), training on laparoscopic simulators for nurses (10h), training in microsurgery (10 h), training on a da Vinci Si® robot, dry lab (1 h) and then wet lab (4 h). A team training module is carried out at the end of training. Trainees' performances are continuously evaluated by simulator software or by teachers for the robot surgery. Results: Since 2008, more than 100 surgeons and 30 nurses trained for a period of 8 days. The results of the questionnaires showed a very important satisfaction. All trainees did acquire the proficiency level (defined by expert mean level - 1sd). Experience in laparoscopic surgery did not improve the speed of learning in contrast to the experience in microsurgery and video games. Conclusion: The multidisciplinary and multimodal academic training program brings all trainees, (with a variable learning time) to a proficiency level. It is scalable, taking advantage of acquired experience with for example the recent introduction of team training.

%X Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Africa and Asia. Despite an UN Millennium Development Goal to reduce maternal mortality rates, no significant effect has resulted to date, in large part because women in these areas give birth in rural communities with poor access to definitive care. Traditional birth attendants (TBAs) provide care for delivering mothers; however, they are neither trained nor equipped to recognize or manage PPH as a life-threatening emergent condition. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a low-cost, portable simulator for training TBAs and nurse midwives in the use of bimanual compression to manage PPH. Clinicians in USA and Ghana were consulted to develop the engineering specifications, including low cost, long lifetime, easy to use, portable, and high anatomic and procedural fidelity. Pugh charts were used to finalize the design from multiple concepts. The simulator was built and evaluated for validity by American and Ghanaian obstetricians, nurse midwives, midwifery students, and TBAs. The feasibility of the simulator for training illiterate learners was also assessed. The simulator was evaluated to be an effective training platform with excellent fidelity and valid feedback mechanisms. It was demonstrated to be a feasible platform for training illiterate TBAs to perform bimanual compression. The low cost, portable simulator developed for this project has the potential to reduce maternal mortality from PPH in the developing world. Research is ongoing in this application.

%X Introduction: Development of robotic surgery requires training and assessment of specific skills. Training on animal model or in operating room is expensive and exposes to medico-legal implications of the learning curve. Virtual reality simulators are an interesting alternative, already used in laparoscopy but still under development for robotic surgery. The aim of this study is to check the validity of the Mimic® simulator as a tool for learning robotic surgery specific skills. Material &Methods: A prospective study was conducted from December 2009 to March 2010, using a robotic surgery simulator dVTrainer (MIMIC®). 75 subjects (5 experts with more than 100 robotic cases, 6 confirmed robotic surgeons with 10 to 40 robotic cases, 8 robotic beginners, 37 surgeons and residents, 19 nurses and medical students) were included. Five exercises representative of robotic specific skills (camera moving, clutching, endowrist manipulation, hand coordination and visual force feedback) were chosen. The analysis was performed by two experts and based on quiz, on more than 1100 scores on the simulator and on videotaped similar exercises performed on an actual Da Vinci S. Results: Face and content validity were considered as high by most of the subjects. Yet, some limitations about rotation, fluidity and 3D-vision were reported by participants. Assessment of competence with the dV-Trainer was highly reliable (correlation coefficient = 0.783). The simulator was able to significantly differentiate five levels of ability (ANOVA p < 0.05). The assessment on dV-Trainer was overall relevant regarding concurrent validity (correlation coefficient = 0.822). When studied separately, some criteria and exercises were medium relevant and need improvement before being included in a credentialing program. Conclusion: The robotic surgery simulator dV-Trainer is a reliable and valid support tool for certification. Further studies are needed to choose the more relevant among the 30 further developed exercises and to develop the fundamentals in robotic surgery.

%X Confidence and self-confidence are crucial practice elements in nursing education and practice. Nurse educators should have an understanding of the concept of confidence in order to assist in the accomplishment of nursing students and their learning of technical and nontechnical skills. With the aim of facilitating trusted care of patients in the healthcare setting, nursing professionals must exhibit confidence, and, as such, clarification and analysis of its meaning is necessary. The purpose of this analysis is to provide clarity to the meaning of the concept confidence/self-confidence, while gaining a more comprehensive understanding of its attributes, antecedents, and consequences. Walker and Avant's eight-step method of concept analysis was utilized for the framework of the analysis process with model, contrary, borderline, and related cases presented along with attributes, antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents identified. Understanding both the individualized development of confidence among prelicensure nursing students and the role of the nurse educator in the development of confident nursing practice, nurse educators can assist students in the development of confidence and competency. Future research surrounding the nature and development of confidence/self-confidence in the prelicensure nursing student experiencing human patient simulation sessions would assist to help educators further promote the development of confidence. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

%X Tools that supported both memory and cognitive decision-making enabled human intelligence over thousands of years. The latest knowledge-supporting tools are computers that assist lawyers, architects, accountants, engineers, and hundreds of other professions on a daily basis [1]. Many clinical and administrative computer applications improve clinical and other processes, examples range from computer-assisted medical coding to computer-assisted nursing support. It must be recognized that the scientific body of medicine has grown to a state where no clinician can memorize all the data necessary for daily care functions. Emotions and other distracting features flaw human decision-making. This applies also to radiologists and surgeons. The effects of the information society and the emerging digital society have moved the field of computer assistance to higher levels of sophistication that allow access to more relevant and timely information, as well as specialty-specific algorithms for both text search and image recognition, and natural language processing techniques. Yet how can one integrate all the information onto a meaningful and user-friendly platform? While various approaches, such as TIMSS [2], are being discussed in standards circles, one has to wait for new industry solutions. Yet one must admit the difficulties in creating clinical interoperability during the last decades. In contrast, mobile systems have created interoperability that can integrate thousands of different apps in a secure way. New sensing devices, image recognition techniques, machine learning, use of big data, and the Internet of Medical Things are all part of the new interoperable mobile computing field that has grown as an alternative to traditional health information systems. As connected computers can store both an unprecedented amount of data and algorithms for decision-making, information systems in general have become more system-centric and less dependent on traditional standards and HIS systems. They also provide a new machine intelligence that requires less and less human interaction. Think of automated imaging systems comparing hundred thousands of similar images to promote better understanding. Such a process will be supported by data flowing from other sources, some directly from patients, others from areas that were not traditionally part of the fields of surgery and radiology. More than 300 apps in the field of clinical imaging are used for teaching purposes, as reference assistants, to provide viewing software, to help with patient education, and to assist in various care processes within health information systems. Most of them function outside traditional HIS systems. Also, a wide range of sensing devices that are available today can obtain and transmit patients' data to the care providers. Yet most hospitals are not equipped to capture such data within their EHRS and imaging diagnostic system. Nor can they arrange the huge volume of data for quick access to relevant information. Image recognition techniques are not quite fully developed, but indications are that such systems will enter the market soon. Such AI-driven systems can identify anatomical features and abnormalities in medical images such as CT, MRI, ultrasound, or other scans and can also draw on text and other data in a patient's medical record to suggest possible diagnoses and treatments. Much of the image recognition development is currently done behind closed doors of governments, yet once some of these systems will be made public, they can be expected to have a large impact on medical imaging. One example that has gone public with its developments is IBM. Computer-assisted imaging will enter a new era when one adds the functions of machine learning, a process in which systems learn from derived knowledge based on the volume of images. Big Data will add a new dimension to image processes and in particular to image-based diagnostic processes when previously neglected environmental, patient-specific professional, nutritional, and other nanobot-created informatio is added. In addition, it is difficult to imagine today how the Internet of Medical Things will affect healthcare and future diagnostic imaging. These are the sensors that are surrounding a patient's life but are not attached to him/her, such as the bathroom mirror that tracks the patient's ECG with diagnostic accuracy. Or the toothbrush that looks for cavities and the potential for systemic bacterial contamination that begins in the mouth. Current indications are that those systems will be parallel to traditional HIS systems. The optimal use of new imaging systems is dependent on internal and external communication among all professionals involved in a patient's care. In order to bring the collective expertise of clinicians and wellness providers to the care process, new communication systems must be created that allow an increased exchange of images and request input from other disciplines. Conclusion The level of sophistication in computer-assistance for medical imaging is increasing to a point where more data will be involved in the process. A new communication pattern should support new AI-based imaging systems in order to provide the best diagnostic imaging intelligence. Decisions should not be made in silos; the radiologist should communicate with others directly involved in a patient's care. They should enable a surgeon or radiologist to discuss images by exchanging image details as well as EHR data on a routine basis. While the implementation of a communication infrastructure should be priority for all providers, they may also want to look outside the traditional HIS community for new solutions to implement AI-driven solutions.

%X Background: Australia has some significant challenges in providing consistent, quality education to clinical staff to improve clinical transfusion practice. These include large distances between major centres and a large number of rural and remote hospitals and health centres with small numbers of staff administering transfusions on an occasional basis. In addition,as blood in Australia is supplied free of charge to patients, it is often perceived as a “no-cost” product with very few cost/price indicators given to clinicians that may assist with controlling usage. In late 2007 the BloodSafe transfusion safety and quality improvement program in South Australia released an e-learning education program (www.bloodsafelearning.org.au) for doctors, nurses, scientists and support staff involved in the transfusion chain. This aimed to overcome some of these challenges and assist hospitals with new accreditation requirements for transfusion training and credentialing. Results and uptake: Initially developed for a single state (South Australia) this resource has been adopted by all states and territories, with 36,601 users registered to December 31, 2009. A significant number of users come from rural and remote areas. Completion of this is mandatory in some health services and regions and it has been incorporated into university medical and nursing curricula. User testing with final year medical students (n = 98) has demonstrated that the content has provided increased understanding of the appropriate use of blood (83% of respondents), increased confidence and ability to organise a transfusion including appropriate consent (90%) and confidence in responding to a transfusion reaction (79%). Unsolicited feedback has been extremely positive with users commenting on the instructional design, use of video and interactivity to model best practice, and case studies that demonstrate how easy it is for problems to both occur, and also be prevented. An administrative and reporting tool allows organisations to access registration and completion data for monitoring uptake and meeting accreditation requirements. Approximately 4% of users have encountered a problem. These include completion certificates not being received, lack of an email address required for registration, typographic errors by users, and inadequate technology (software and hardware) to access this. Solutions and support have been developed to address these challenges. Future Directions: With uptake and endorsement by all states and territories of Australia a successful submission was made for national funding to provide access and support across all of Australia. AUD$1.2 million has been provided over 3 years for a program management office, additional staff, ongoing support, further development including new content, and a promotional strategy and resources. A comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of this tool will also be undertaken during the funding term.

%X Study Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess patient and provider perspectives related to collection, documentation, and use of patient sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI) data in the emergency department (ED). Methods: A purposive sample of participants was recruited for semi-structured indepth interviews. Patient participants were recruited through community outreach, flyers, and social media. ED provider participants including physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers (APP), were recruited from three community and two academic centers. All interviews were conducted by one of two researchers. Audio data were de-identified, transcribed, and coded using the constant comparative method common to grounded theory. Results: Fifty-three patient participants were interviewed, including 14 heterosexual, 12 gay, 12 bisexual, 9 lesbian, 2 queer, and 4 participants identifying as pansexual, asexual or unsure; 16 of whom identified as trans gender or gender nonconforming. Patient participants ranged in age from 22 to 67 (mean 42). Twentysix provider participants were interviewed, including 12 nurses, 9 physicians and 5 APPs. Provider participants all identified as cisgender and heterosexual and ranged in age from 27 to 63 (mean 39). Patients and providers agreed that these data should be collected when reproductive health was the primary reason for seeking ED care. However, for all other medical concerns, providers felt this information was irrelevant because they indicated that similar care is provided to all patients regardless of SO and GI. In contrast, patients often perceived collection of SO and GI to be important regardless of their medical concern, with some patients admitting to delaying treatment until illness worsened secondary to the inability to choose an emergency provider sensitive to and knowledgeable of SO and GI health issues. While many patients felt these data should be routinely collected to improve patient-centered care, they often described the need for additional training to ensure ED providers are comfortable addressing SO and GI minority health issues, including proper recognition of a patient's name, title, pronouns, and family/relationship context. Conclusion: Despite endorsement by the IOM and the Joint Commission for collection of SO and GI data, provider-perceived lack of medical relevance is a major barrier to routine collection of these data in the ED. Additionally, this provider perspective may be hindering the delivery of patient-centered care, with some patients noting that they may delay seeking emergent care because of concerns about provider sensitivity. Many patients feel this information is relevant to their health care, but note that additional training of ED providers regarding SO and GI minority health may be necessary. This discordance needs to be addressed with recognition that routine collection of SO and GI data ultimately serves to provide patient-centered care and provides data to better understand the health and possible health care disparities of SO and GI minorities.

%X Technology in education is moving quickly in terms of the hardware and software applications available, but also due to the expectations of an increasingly digitally competent student population. Academics have to rethink their pedagogy in relation to these changes. Nurse educators, in particular, must face the challenge of effectively integrating technology into what is essentially a hands-on, people-centred profession. To date, the factors most commonly cited as barriers to the adoption of e-learning by academics have focused on explicit and tangible ('hard') issues. Less frequently mentioned are the implicit and tacit ('soft') factors which are harder to identify. This article describes a pilot study using Q-methodology to explore the limitations of commonly used research methods in identifying how these hard and soft issues are prioritised by individuals, through the voices of nurse educators.

%X Aims: To report a study undertaken to explore the underlying factors influencing e-learning adoption in nurse education. Background: Despite e-learning's high profile it has not been readily integrated into teaching practice in nurse education. Previous research has identified generic, cross-disciplinary factors but has left out 'soft' factors. Design: The study adopted an exploratory descriptive design. Methods: Q-methodology was used to explore e-learning adoption in a Division of Nursing located in an institution of Higher Education in the UK. Between September-December 2009, 38 participants were recruited to participate in Q-sorts and post-sort interviews. The Q-sort data were factor analysed and the interviews were coded to their respective factors to develop in-depth narratives. Findings: Four factors were identified: 'E-learning advocates' saw e-learning's potential to improve nurse education and prepare future nurses for their evolving role; the 'Humanists' had avoided e-learning because they valued human interaction; the 'Sceptics' doubted that technology could improve learning outcomes; and the 'Pragmatics,' only used e-learning as a tool to post lecture notes online to supplement what they covered in class. Conclusion: The findings point to the variety of responses existing among nurse academics faced with integrating e-learning into their teaching. Moving beyond the binary labels commonly attributed to those considered either 'early adopters' or 'laggards,' the findings contribute to the literature by revealing a wider breadth of views and responses towards technology. Acknowledging these views can inform future e-learning strategies and lead to improvement in e-learning use in nurse education. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Background: Today, in-hospital telemetry monitoring is an important part of both diagnosis and treatment of patients at risk of developing life threatening arrhythmias and is widely used in critical as well as non-critical wards. Cardiac nurses staff the central monitor stations and are responsible for correct electrode placement and satisfactory electrode attachment, thus ensuring optimal quality of the monitoring. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine whether a complex educational intervention had an effect on i) electrode placement, ii) electrode attachment, iii) hygiene, and iv) patient information regarding in-hospital telemetry monitoring. Methods: The study was conducted during two six-week periods in an urban 1400-inpatient bed university hospital in western Norway with 104.000 somatic admissions a year. A prospective interventional study design was applied with data collected before and after the implementation of a complex educational intervention consisting of continued education, informational posters, and an eLearning course particularly developed for this study. Data was obtained using two registration forms examining demographic background variables and ten different variables regarding electrode placement and attachment, hygiene, and patient information. All patients ordained to telemetry monitoring during the registration periods were included, none were excluded. Results: At pre-intervention registration, 26% of the electrodes were misplaced. Twelve percent of the patients were informed of limitations in cellular phone use when monitored with telemetry, and 71% used a protective cover. Post-intervention registration showed significant improvements on four variables; placement of the black electrode (p < 0.001), use of protective cover (p < 0.001), information regarding purpose of monitoring (p = 0.005) and information regarding limitations in cellular phone use (p = 0.003). Still, 23% of the electrodes were misplaced. Conclusion: Our study highlights the need for continued education regarding in-hospital telemetry monitoring in both coronary care units and other units monitoring their patients with telemetry. Furthermore, this study indicates that development of national guidelines for electrocardiographic monitoring in hospitals would be beneficial as this is non-existent in Norway.

Data was obtained using two abstraction sheets examining demographic background variables and ten different variables regarding electrode placement and attachment, hygiene, and patient information. All patients ordained to telemetry monitoring during the registration periods were included, none were excluded. Results: At pre-intervention registration, 26% of the electrodes were misplaced. Twelve percent of the patients were informed of limitations in cellular phone use when monitored with telemetry, 70% were informed of the purpose of monitoring, and 71% used a protective cover.

Conclusion: There is a need for continued guidance and education regarding in-hospital telemetry monitoring in both coronary care units and in general wards. Correct electrode placement, appropriate electrode attachment and hygiene are pivotal when monitoring patients. Improvements are required in all these areas. Both development of specific European guidelines for in-hospital electrocardiographic monitoring and recommendations on how telemetry should be organized and integrated in clinical practice are warranted.

%X E-learning will play an important role in the training portfolio of students in higher and vocational education. Within the LEONARDO-DA-VINCI action programme transnational pilot projects were funded by the European Union, which aimed to improve the usage and quality of e-learning tools in education and professional training. The overall aim of the LEONARDO-DA-VINCI pilot project " e-learning-assistant" was to create new didactical and technical e-learning tools for Europe-wide use in nursing education. Based on a new situation-oriented learning approach, nursing teachers enrolled in the project were instructed to adapt, develop and implement e- and blended learning units. According to the training contents nursing modules were developed by teachers from partner institutions, implemented in the project centers and evaluated by students. The user-package " e-learning-assistant" as a product of the project includes two teacher training units, the authoring tool " synapse" to create situation-based e-learning units, a student's learning platform containing blended learning modules in nursing and an open sourced web-based communication centre. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Objectives 1. Describe the benefits, limitations, and status of interdisciplinary palliative education in the current healthcare education environment and how such education could advance and improve interdisciplinary practice. 2. Describe innovative teaching methods, including virtual reality approaches, and their added value in providing a practical and transportable interdisciplinary palliative care education. 3. Discuss the lessons learned in the early years of developing a mandatory, integrated, interdisciplinary palliative care curriculum across the disciplines of medicine, nursing, social work, and pastoral care. Background. Interdisciplinary practice is core to palliative care, yet students of the healthcare professions are rarely prepared to practice in interdisciplinary teams. The National Cancer Institute funded the University of Louisville to develop, implement, and test a novel, mandatory, and interdisciplinary palliative care curriculum for medical, nursing, social work, and chaplaincy students. This abstract reports on the initial work, progress, and lessons from educators designing and implementing this innovative curriculum. Case Description. The council began work in the fall of 2010. Led by nine learning objectives, members were assigned to four subgroups based on major learning activities: didactics, clinical rotations, clinical vignettes, and standardized patient and family scenariosdall with a focus on interdisciplinary learning and creative group learning experiences. Building on previous efforts in palliative education (ELNEC, EPEC-O, and the ACE Project), 14 didactic modules, to be taught online using interactive technology, were designed. Virtual reality and avatar experiences were evaluated. Community partnerships were developed to design interdisciplinary clinical experiences for learners. Interdisciplinary clinical vignettes (longitudinal case studies) were developed to teach an interdisciplinary perspective in addressing key challenges. Standardized patient and family scenarios were written to address complex and challenging clinical issues. Each learning activity focused on meeting specific learning Objectives, developing creative and novel solutions, and addressing complex/restrictive curricular structures of each discipline, practical implementation, sustainability, and portability. Conclusion. While the value seems clear, the challenges and obstacles can appear overwhelming when attempting to involve learners from four different schools and disciplines, all having different academic schedules and discipline specific learning demands and unique cultures. But interdisciplinary education can be accomplished if educators are willing to be flexible, creative, and persistent. This case study of one educational institution developing such a curriculum can serve as amodel for others hoping to prepare students for interdisciplinary palliative care.

%X Senior nurses within frontline NHS Trusts in East Anglia were consulted about their perceptions of the genetics-related knowledge and education required by nurses working in their Trusts. They disagreed with policy decision makers, i.e. the Government and genetics specialists, on the currently necessary knowledge levels. They also did not recognize genetics as an important issue in current everyday nursing activities. The difference in perception also related to the speed with which its presence and importance will increase. Nurses already working under considerable pressure while not perceiving the importance of genetics in everyday practice cannot be expected to willingly absorb new genetics-related knowledge. The National Genetics Education and Development Centre in Birmingham will have to reach out to practitioners and managers throughout the UK and establish a shared platform from which to develop this issue in the future.

%X Background. Writing plays a central role in the communication of scientific ideas and is therefore a key aspect in researcher education, ultimately determining the success and long-term sustainability of their careers. Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing. Methods. Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss's kappa. A post-hoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy. Results. Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the on-line group (0.91 0.81 vs. 2.05 1.23; p = 0.0219). Conclusion. Our protocol for on-line scientific writing instruction is better than standard face-to-face instruction in terms of writing quality and student satisfaction. Future studies should evaluate the protocol efficacy in larger longitudinal cohorts involving participants from different languages. © 2009 Phadtare et al.

%X Background: Emergency department (ED) blood samples have a higher rate of hemolysis (6%-30%) than the 2% benchmark established by ASCP. Hemolyzed specimens may require re-drawing and re-testing, resulting in delays in treatment, delays clinical decision making, prolonged ED length of stay, and patient dissatisfaction. While the reasons for high hemolysis rates are multifactorial, they are typically caused during the pre-analytic phase of the testing process. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an education initiative aimed towards optimization of a set of preanalytic factors on hemolysis rates in ED blood samples. Methods: This was a prospective interventional study in an urban tertiary care ED with annual volume of approximately 65,000 visits. Utilizing the Sunquest lab data platform, we evaluated all potassium lab draws during two independent periods. The historical control period represented lab draws between 8/1/14-8/23/14 and the comparative period represented draws between 8/1/15-8/23/15, after a predetermined level 85% completion rate of the online education module. The draws in 2015 followed an online education initiative given to nurses and medics in the ED to inform them of best practices in reducing hemolysis including the following: straight stick use, use of antecubital vein for IV lab draws, use of large gauge needles and tourniquet time less than 60 seconds.. We compared the overall frequency of hemolysis using Chi-square tests. Results: The overall hemolysis rate during the control period was 11.57% (259/2238 samples). Following the intervention, hemolysis rates were significantly lower 9.68%; (221/2283, p=0.04). Hemolysis rates with comment and gross hemolysis rates were also less frequent but neither was statistically significant. Conclusion: An online educational effort to instruct frontline staff on best practices had a significant impact on hemolysis rates. Further evaluation of the long-term effects and the specific content that was effective may be valuable in improving this practice in the ED.

%X Background: Routine cancer pain screening and assessment is the foundation upon which effective pain management is built. Whilst these simple practices are recommended in all evidence based cancer pain guidelines, they are often not routinely implemented, resulting in undetected and undertreated cancer pain in people living with cancer. This translational research study utilised a novel online performance feedback intervention to improve cancer nurses' pain assessment practices. Aim: To measure the impact of a tailored Qstream© cancer pain assessment performance feedback intervention on inpatient cancer nurses': i) pain assessment capabilities; and ii) adherence to cancer pain screening and assessment guideline recommendations. Methods: A quasi-experimental, prospective follow-up study involving specialist cancer nurses in five acute care settings within one translational cancer research network in Australia. Participant survey and patient chart audit data were collected: pre (T1) and post (T2-T3) intervention, with final chart audit 4 weeks (T4) post audit and feedback. Participants' completed 11 case based pain assessment scenarios delivered to their nominated email using a spaced learning format, with the T1-T2 pain assessment chart audit data fed back to participants at T3. Results: Participants who completed the intervention (n = 44) increased their pain assessment knowledge, assessment tool knowledge and confidence to undertake a pain assessment (p < 0.001), with this change maintained at 10 weeks post intervention. The positive changes in nurses' pain assessment capabilities' translated into a significant increasing linear trend in the proportion of documented pain assessments in patients' charts at three time points (χ2 trend = 18.28, df = 1, p < 0.001). The median pain assessment documentation quality scores also increased during the study period (Kruskal-Wallis test χ21 = 7.17, p = 0.007)]. Conclusions: Integrating specialised pain assessment clinical content and audit and feedback into a spaced on-line learning platform improved cancer nurses' pain assessment practices. These results need to be confirmed in a controlled study.

%X Background: The resurgence of home hemodialysis (HHD) underlines the importance of educational programs. Brainstorming is a powerful tool for innovation, widely employed in industry but seldom used in medicine. The aim of this study was to define an e-learning Web platform for HHD patients via a brainstorming approach. Methods: Four brainstorming sessions were held 2-6 weeks apart. Twelve people were involved: 2 dialysis physicians, 2 nurses, 2 HHD patients, 2 caregivers, a filmmaker, 2 computer experts (1 with a psychology degree) and a senior engineer. Each session was summarized as the starting point for the following one. The topics discussed were the platform structure and its logo. Results: For the platform, the following requirements were defined: teaching should be extensive and tailored to different levels of knowledge; all available teaching tools (tutorials, demonstrations, recorded and written materials) should be used; films enhance emotional participation and can be used to reduce fears; the contents should include general information on chronic kidney disease, details of all types of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (how and why), dialysis accidents, blood and imaging tests, laws and reimbursements, direct experiences and history of RRT. Remote monitoring and visual interactions are important for reassurance about HHD and should be provided. The requirements for the logo were that it be innovative, related to daily life, representative of a holistic approach and convey happiness. The logo "Hom-e-hem" was created, playing on the assonance between the religious term Om and the word home, with the e of electronic linking it with hem, short for hemodialysis. Conclusion: Brainstorming sessions can be used to design patient-tailored educational interventions. The key message, "self-care is a bridge from illness back to life," may apply to a wider context. © 2012 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

%X Background and purpose of the study The answer to Maxi-Emergencies (ME) requires a strong link between territorial services and hospitals. To highlight strengths and weaknesses of PEMAF (Emergency Plan for Massive Influx of Injured) and propose improvements, a representative sample of hospitals nationwide was tested. Materials and methods PROJECT ROME (Maxi Hospital Emergency Response) investigate the degree of application of PEMAF hospitals based on their complexity and geographic location through a questionnaire developed jointly by SIMEU-FIMEUC-FADOI and Sapienza University of Rome, compiled on voluntary basis using the online platform of SIMEU by a potential sample of 100 hospitals. Results To date, 35 facilities responded from 15 Regions, Northern Italy (51.5%). 40% were Second Level Emergency Departments (ED), followed by First Level ED (30%) and First Aid Unit (28%). 75% of hospitals refers to carry out a PEMAF training, 31% organized a dissemination plan for all staff. Large hospitals are more careful to carry out the training (100% of hospitals with> 80,000 versus 30% for others) for medical personnel (29%) and nurses (25%). Conclusions In progress is the results elaboration about plan activation, operational procedures, logistics. To date, the need for increased knowledge in ME management is a preliminary result.

%X BACKGROUND: With the proliferation of portable digital technology, mobile learning is becoming increasingly popular in nursing education and practice. Most of the research in this field has been concentrated on small-scale projects in high income countries. Very little is known about the ways in which nurses and midwives use mobile technology in remote and resource poor areas in informal learning contexts in low and middle income countries. OBJECTIVES: To address this gap, this study investigates whether nurses use mobile phones as effective educational tools in marginalized and remote areas, and if so, how and why. SETTING AND METHODS: In rural South Africa, 16 nurses who attended an advanced midwifery education program, facilitators and clinical managers were interviewed about their use of digital mobile technology for learning. Techniques of qualitative content analysis were used to examine the data. RESULTS: Several rich "organically-grown", learning practices were identified: mobile phone usage facilitated (1) authentic problem solving; (2) reflective practice; (3) emotional support and belongingness; (4) the realization of unpredictable teaching situations; and (5) life-long learning. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that mobile phones, and the convergence of mobile phones and social media, in particular, change learning environments. In addition, these tools are suitable to connect learners and learning distributed in marginalized areas. Finally, a few suggestions are made about how these insights from informal settings can inform the development of more systematic mobile learning formats.

%X This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of an eLearning program intended to provide incoming nursing students with the basic knowledge, skills and abilities needed to succeed in graduate-level, online coursework. Using Mayer's principles (2008) for the effective design of multimedia instruction, an open-access, self-directed, online program was developed. The Graduate School Boot Camp includes five online modules focused on learning strategies and time management, academic writing, technology, research, and library skills. To motivate and engage learners, the program integrates a fun, graphical sports theme with audiovisual presentations, examples, demonstrations and practice exercises. Learners begin with a self-assessment based on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire or MSLQ (Pintrich et al., 1993). To assess change in knowledge levels before and after completing the program, learners take a pre-test and post-test. Preliminary findings indicate that the students found the information relevant and useful. They enjoyed the self-paced, multimedia format, and liked the option to return to specific content later. This innovative program offers a way to prepare students proactively, and may prove useful in identifying students at risk and connecting them with the appropriate resources to facilitate successful program completion.

%X Implementation of nurse authorisation of blood components in Scotland has been supported by the Chief Nursing Officer and the Health Board Nurse Directors, and they agreed that the Governance Framework (www.transfusionguidelines.org.uk) should be used as the basis for taking this initiative forward. In addition a working group was set up to ensure that a consistent, national approach was adopted. The nurses who have shown interest in this role are from specialist areas such as, neonatology, haematology and critical care. They are experienced nurses working at advance practice level. NHS Fife led the way for Haematology nurses, NHS Tayside for Advanced Neonatal Practitioners (ANNPs), andNHSLanarkshire for intensive care practitioners. A knowledge gap analysis was undertaken and a learning programme developed. The programme incorporated a combination of lectures and discussion sessions, each with identified learning outcomes, delivered by experts in transfusion and the appropriate clinical speciality. Since 2010, six bespoke workshops have been held with approximately 20 attendees at each. Following attendance at the workshop, the nurses undergo an agreed period of supervised practice before being 'signed off' as competent. A post-workshop questionnaire obtained a 78% response rate. Eighty five percent of nurses were authorising blood components and reported they had not experienced any barriers to developing their role. Fifteen percent were not authorising, for a number of reasons e.g. changed roles, or maternity leave. The majority of nurses were authorising red cells and platelets only. Supervision and mentorship was seen as an essential element of role preparation by all respondees, and 23% were still in the process of completing a Portfolio which was developed to provide their mentor with evidence of competence. To ensure sustainability the resources and workshop presentations that were developed to support this role, are now available on LearnProNHS. LearnPro NHS is used throughout NHS Scotland to deliver the blood transfusion e-Learning programme, and this will ensure easy access to the same resources. These experienced practitioners are keen to see their roles evolve, so that services can be developed to meet the challenge of providing high quality person-centred, appropriate, safe transfusion care.

%X In 2009 the framework document outlining guidance for nurses and midwives wishing to extend their role to 'prescribe' blood components was launched. Nurse 'prescribing' of blood components is seen as having the potential to provide safer, more patient-centred transfusion care. The framework document provides robust governance to help ensure that practitioners who wish to undertake this role practice safely. In NHSScotland the framework document has been used as the basis of implementing this initiative. The Scottish Chief Nursing Officer and the Nurse Directors of NHSSotland Boards supported the establishment of a working group to provide supportive guidance to ensure that a consistent and national approach is adopted. The nurses that have shown interested in this role are in specialist areas such as, neonatology, haematology and critical care. These are experienced senior nurses working at advance practice levels. Using the agreed approach NHS Fife has led the way for Haematology nurses, NHS Tayside Advanced Neonatal Practitioners (ANNPs), and NHS Lanarkshire for intensive care practitioners. A knowledge gap analysis was undertaken and four bespoke study workshops have been held to date. Following attendance at the workshop, the nurses undergo a period of supervised practice before being 'signed off' as competent. Plans are in place to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the impact of the role once it is grounded in practice. To ensure sustainability and share the guidance documents, education resources and exemplars that have already been developed to support this role, the Learning Content Management System, Learn Pro NHS will be used as a repository. LearnPro NHS is used throughout NHS Scotland to deliver the Learn Blood Transfusion e learning programme. Although this model is directed towards the specific requirements of NHS Scotland, it supports the principles of consistency and transferability as highlighted in the Advanced Nursing Practice toolkit http://www.advancedpractice.scot.nhs.uk/.

%X Introduction: Social networks (1) have been embedded in our daily life for a long time. They constitute a powerful tool used nowadays for both searching and exchanging information on different issues by using Internet searching engines (Google, Bing, etc.) and Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter etc.). In this paper, are presented the results of a research based on the frequency and the type of the usage of the Internet and the Social Networks by the general public and the health professionals. Objectives: The objectives of the research were focused on the investigation of the frequency of seeking and meticulously searching for health information in the social media by both individuals and health practitioners. The exchanging of information is a procedure that involves the issues of reliability and quality of information. Methods: In this research, by using advanced statistical techniques an effort is made to investigate the participant's profile in using social networks for searching and exchanging information on health issues. Results: Based on the answers 93 % of the people, use the Internet to find information on health-subjects. Considering principal component analysis, the most important health subjects were nutrition (0.719 %), respiratory issues (0.79 %), cardiological issues (0.777%), psychological issues (0.667%) and total (73.8%). Conclusions: The research results, based on different statistical techniques revealed that the 61.2% of the males and 56.4% of the females intended to use the social networks for searching medical information. Based on the principal components analysis, the most important sources that the participants mentioned, were the use of the Internet and social networks for exchanging information on health issues. These sources proved to be of paramount importance to the participants of the study. The same holds for nursing, medical and administrative staff in hospitals.

%X Background: Studies have demonstrated that patients forget 40%-80% of the information they receive almost immediately after hearing it. In addition, nearly half of the information they retain is incorrect. Given the importance of understanding one's disease process and follow-up, this adversely affects patient outcomes. Patients who do not clearly comprehend their disease state or postdischarge instructions may decompensate before seeing their primary care provider and subsequently get readmitted. National readmission rates for Medicare patients are around 20% and for some diseases like heart failure are closer to 23%. A multidisciplinary team was convened to develop a process to improve patient education and affect outcomes. Purpose: To develop a patient education strategy for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Description: A multidisciplinary team is using Lean methodology to improve the efficiency and quality of care transitions. A smaller subgroup is examining the role of patient education in these transitions. This group identified the teach-back concept-using humble inquiry to gauge a patient's understanding of the patient education process-as a potential tool to improve outcomes. The team piloted the use of teach-back on heart failure patients on a medical-surgical unit. Patient and nursing education colleagues developed a series of questions related to heart failure and its treatment. Patients are asked these questions over 3 days, sequentially building on the previous day's material. The questions were programmed into the computer-assisted physician order entry system, providing both a prompt and a framework for the questions to the bedside nurse. A training video was developed and placed in our e-Learning system. More than 1400 nursing colleagues have completed this learning module thus far. Press Ganey data are being tracked to gauge patient satisfaction with teach-back. Analysis of the intervention is promising. In the first quarter of FY11, 180 unique heart failure patients had teach-back. The readmission rate for those patients was 7.29%, with a length of stay of 5.14 days during the second hospitalization. A total of 289 unique heart failure patients did not receive teach-back during the same time frame. The readmission rate for these patients was 9.66%, with a length of stay of 6.87 days during the second hospitalization. Additional teach-back questions are now being developed for community-acquired pneumonia, stroke, myocardial infarction, anticoagulation, hypoglycemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusions: Teach-back is a general concept that can be applied to multiple disease states. The concept can be taught and spread throughout a hospital or network relatively quickly. Teach-back may have a positive impact on patient satisfaction and appears to have the potential to positively affect readmission rates by improving patient understanding of their disease process.

%X This action research study was designed to explore, in-depth, how 70 senior nursing students experienced an assignment that involved reading and reflecting on a short story, Ella, and the educator's experience during the process. Four sources of data were collected: student reflections, field notes, a classroom process recording by an expert educator/observer, and a focus group interview. Four themes emerged: (1) student reflections revealed their inner, often hidden landscapes; (2) Ella prompted clarification of the past and/or triggered future projective thinking; (3) Ella clarified difficult-to-teach concepts; and (4) the interface between students' thoughts and teacher responses provided a platform of connectivity. I propose that reading well-written stories may enhance students' clinical reasoning skills and ethical comportment within the confines of a classroom. In addition, when students are introduced to literary patients like Ella, they can dwell with the characters at a more peaceful pace which, in itself, may encourage reflectivity.

%X Background and Methods. From June 1989 through March 1990, 26 patients, of whom 23 had diabetes, contracted acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a hospital in California. All 26 patients and one HBV carrier (also a diabetic) had been admitted to a single medical ward during the six months before the case patients became infected with HBV. To determine the source of the infection, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of the 72 patients with diabetes who had been admitted to the ward from January through December 1989 and a case-control study comparing the 3 nondiabetic patients who contracted hepatitis with 20 nondiabetic controls. Results. The retrospective cohort study of all the patients with diabetes who were admitted to the ward during 1989 found that those who underwent capillary blood sampling by finger stick with a spring-loaded lancet device were more likely to contract HBV infection than those who did not have finger sticks (attack rate, 42 percent vs. 0 percent; P = 0.08). In addition, a dose-response relation was observed between the number of finger sticks received and the frequency of hepatitis B (P = 0.002). The case-control study found that all 3 of the nondiabetic patients who contracted hepatitis underwent finger-stick blood sampling with the device, as compared with none of the 20 nondiabetic controls (P = 0.0006). A review of nursing procedures indicated that the platform of the device was not routinely changed after each use; this finding suggested that contamination of the platform by HBV-infected blood was the mechanism of percutaneous transmission of HBV. Conclusions. Proper use of finger-stick devices as well as strict adherence to universal precautions to avoid contamination by blood are required to decrease the possibility of transmission of blood-borne pathogens among hospitalized patients.

%X The National Audit Project (NAP4) identified that serious airway complications were commoner on intensive care units (ICU) and were related to lack of skilled airway trained staff and available equipment.1 The NAP4 recommended increased training of ICU teams in airway management. A complete audit cycle was carried out to ascertain the knowledge and skills of ICU nursing staff in assisting with airway management. The original audit in February 2012 involved the distribution of surveys to ICU nurses at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust and investigated their level of training and experience in airway management. We also explored their awareness of the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines and their ability to assemble the advanced airway equipment available. Following the implementation of an airway management training program in September 2012, which incorporated a mandatory study day and an e-learning module, a re-audit was carried out in March 2013. The initial audit had 86 respondents, 61 (70.9%) were band five nurses. Virtually all had assisted with intubation (84/86, 97.6%), however only 23/86 (26.7%) reported receiving formal training in assisting doctors with rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Fifteen of 86 (17.4%) of respondents were aware of the DAS guidelines relating to intubation and 25/86 (29%) felt confident to assist with difficult airway management. The re-audit had 30 respondents consisting of predominantly band five nurses (23, 76.7%). Twenty-seven (90%) had attended the mandatory study day, however only 14/27 (51.9%) had accessed on-line resources. There was significantly greater familiarity with DAS guidelines for difficult intubation (43% vs 17% p=0.004) and increased knowledge of difficult airway equipment (63% vs 29% p=0.003). Overall there was an increase in the number of nurses that felt confident to assist with advanced airway management (42% vs 29%) but this did not reach statistical significance. ICU nurses are essential to the success of airway management in intensive care. Their ability to be aware of potential problems, deal with subsequent difficulties and access and assemble equipment is vital when difficulties arise. This audit demonstrates that basic dedicated training has helped improved the knowledge and confidence of our nursing colleagues in airway management.

%X In the past two decades a great deal of research has demonstrated improved quality of care when mental health care is integrated into primary care. To date, most of the literature has addressed care management for specific mental illnesses. Such programs can be difficult to implement and sustain. We describe a program of "Colocated Collaborative Care," implemented in 2004 that has been sustained and grown over the 6 years since inception. The Primary Mental Health Care clinic at the White River Junction (Vermont) Veterans Affairs Medical Center offers a full spectrum of mental health care that allows 75% of referred patients to receive all of their care within the primary care clinic, thus conserving scarce specialty services for the most complex patients. The clinic is staffed by a therapist and a psychiatrist (or advanced practice nurse) and complemented by care management and health psychology. It makes use of technology to streamline assessment and track outcomes. The clinic provides a mix of care management, specialty expertise and chronic disease management. Originally developed in a capitated health care system, adherence to general principles that guided its development may be useful in any system of care.

%X INTRODUCTION Various meta-analyses have shown that e-learning is as effective as traditional methods of continuing professional education. However, there are some disadvantages to e-learning, such as possible technical problems, the need for greater self-discipline, cost involved in developing programmes and limited direct interaction. Currently, most strategies for teaching amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) worldwide depend on traditional teaching methods. METHODS We implemented a programme that utilised an integrated approach to e-learning. The programme consisted of three sessions of supervised protected time e-learning in an NICU. The objective and subjective effectiveness of the approach was assessed through surveys administered to participants before and after the programme. RESULTS A total of 37 NICU staff (32 nurses and 5 doctors) participated in the study. 93.1% of the participants appreciated the need to acquire knowledge of aEEG. We also saw a statistically significant improvement in the subjective knowledge score (p = 0.041) of the participants. The passing rates for identifying abnormal aEEG tracings (defined as ≥ 3 correct answers out of 5) also showed a statistically significant improvement (from 13.6% to 81.8%, p < 0.001). Among the participants who completed the survey, 96.0% felt the teaching was well structured, 77.8% felt the duration was optimal, 80.0% felt that they had learnt how to systematically interpret aEEGs, and 70.4% felt that they could interpret normal aEEG with confidence. CONCLUSION An integrated approach to e-learning can help improve subjective and objective knowledge of aEEG.

%X Assessment of sedation and delirium is a key component of Critical Care. This audit was motivated by the authors' perceived discrepancies in the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAMICU) scoring on our Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We aimed to compare the RASS and CAM-ICU scores as assessed by the bedside nurse with the assessment by one of the authors (AP). Methods The 'Gold Standard' for RASS and CAM-ICU assessment was agreed by all authors using the published guidelines for each score [1, 2]. Refresher e-learning packages were sent to all ICU staff prior to the audit. On 20 d, each ICU patient underwent independent RASS and CAM-ICU assessments by the bedside nurse and AP. Any discrepancies were highlighted immediately and the reason for the discrepancy explored. All questions were answered and bedside education delivered if required. Results Data were collected for 162 RASS assessments and 135 CAM-ICU assessments performed by both the bedside nurse and AP. The data showed 139 (85%) RASS and 135 (83%) CAM-ICU scores were in agreement. In 7/23 cases (RASS) and 19/27 cases (CAM-ICU) the discrepancy was due to the bedside nurse not being confident to perform the assessment. The variation in score agreement over time is shown in Fig. 1. Discussion These results are encouraging. However, despite the inherent feedback and education as part of the audit, Fig. 1 does not show a reduction in discrepancies over time. This may be partially explained by the high number of agency staff working during the audit period. Another limitation of the audit is that the assessments were not performed simultaneously. This introduces the potential for fluctuations in the patient's clinical status causing the discrepancies in scores. Following the audit we have created laminated bedside guides and pocket cards for RASS and CAM-ICU scoring; issued a 'Sedation and Delirium' booklet to all ICU staff; introduced formal training for RASS/CAM-ICU to all ICU new starters; and offered one-to-one training to all staff. Following these educational interventions we intend to repeat the audit to look for improvement and once achieved, audit on one day each month to ensure the standard is maintained.( Figure persented ).

%X Program/Project Purpose: mHealth has become a major innovation for improving health care delivery, maternal, newborn and child Health (MNCH) and bridging the urban-rural gap in Ghana. While the use of mobile technology in rural areas has become a major innovation to improving health care delivery, little research has been done on the feasibility of utilizing mobile phones for improving front line health workers performance to provide better MNCH care for rural women. Structure/Method/Design: Concern World wide's Innovations for MNCH initiated the Care Community Hub (CCH) project in Ghana to improve motivation among Community Health Nurses (CHNs) through a mobile technology application (app). Human-Centered design techniques were applied to better understand CHNs and to uncover innovative solutions designed for them. This process built the confidence of the CHNs/CHOs and motivated them to contribute more in shaping and building the application, solely owned by them. Outcome & Evaluation: The six module “CHN on the Go” app was developed in partnership with Ghana Health Service (GHS) and Grameen Foundation as a means of reducing CHNs sense of professional isolation and improving CHN motivation. CCH is currently reaching over 300 CHNs and their supervisors in five districts with mobile phones fully loaded with the application to support their work. To date, GHS has adopted the e-learning platform and is planning to roll out a comprehensive training for CHNs on MNCH nationally. The districts plan to integrate the supervisory dashboard developed as a supportive monitoring tool reducing transportation challenges with limited resources. AnM&E framework has been developed to fully manage the process of assessing and reporting program implementation towards achieving project outputs and outcomes. Going Forward: CCH has the potential to radically improve MNCH outcomes as the app can be deployed to other cadres of health workers, including midwives and CHWs, across the country. Also, with mobile network coverage continually expanding and costs for airtime and mobile devices steadily decreasing, phones and tablets are playing an increasingly significant role as a health system support tool particularly from front-line health workers.

%X Introduction. A group of nurse clinicians and educators at a tertiary hospital created their first online asthma management training program for enrolled nurses (ENs). The primary aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of 3 modes of teaching, namely, traditional classroom lecture (TCL), E-learning (EL), and a combination of E-learning and traditional classroom lectures (EL + TCL). The second aim was to examine factors associated with the retention of knowledge in asthma management and the learning preference of ENs. Methods. ENs were assigned to any one of the teaching methods. A pre-post study design was used to assess their knowledge on asthma management prior to teaching and 3 months after teaching. Results. Of the 162 ENs recruited, 59 were assigned to TCL, 55 to EL, and 48 to EL + TCL. A total of 145 (89.6%) ENs completed the 3-month follow-up study. There were significant differences in the mean scores for pre and 3 months post knowledge assessment for all 3 modes of teaching (P <.001). Furthermore, results showed that only 36 (22.2%) ENs would like to choose an asthma management course using EL, compared with 100 ENs (61.7%) preferring EL + TCL and 26 (16.1%) preferring TCL. In all, 156 (96.3%) ENs reported that the training program was useful to health care workers, and 138 (95.2%) ENs were able to apply what they learned to their practice setting. Conclusion. Nurses' demographics and clinical settings did not affect knowledge retention. There were no significant differences in retention of knowledge among the 3 modes of teaching. However, there seems to be an increase in preference for the combination mode of teaching (EL + TCL) as compared with either method alone. © 2012 The Author(s).

%X Background: The ACS population admitted to RDH undergo coronary angiography and if deemed suitable, interval revascularisation procedures at interstate centres, as RDH do not provide such services presently. Objective: We determined the management outcomes of these patients subsequent to coronary angiography and the economic cost incurred by RDH for revascularisation procedures at the interstate centres. Methods: The management outcomes of patients with a diagnosis of ACS who underwent coronary angiography at RDH between the 31st June 2011 and 30th July 2011 were sort from the RDH cardiac catheter lab database. The cost incurred for revascularisation procedureswere determined based on current pricing estimates from the Department of Health, Northern Territory (NT) government. Patient data was collected and analysed with Microsoft Excel 2010 platform.Results: 254 patients with a diagnosis ACS underwent diagnostic coronary angiography of which 92% were (<70 years) and 49% were indigenous in origin. Subsequent management entailed 43% receiving optimal medical therapy, 36% receiving coronary stenting (PCI) and 21% receiving coronary bypass surgery (CABG). Procedural cost, transfer cost, nursing escort and accommodation incurred for PCI and CABG respectively were ($12,404.1/case, 91 patients = $1,128,778) and ($19,867.3/case, 53 patients = $1,052,966).Conclusions: Nearly 60% of ACS patient required revascularisation either by PCI or CABG. Revascularisation cost was considerable asNTgovernment incurred both procedural and nonprocedural cost. If revascularisation procedures were performed locally in NT, an up to 30% cost saving could be observed.

%X BACKGROUND: Needle stick injury (NSI) became a major issue and most of the research focuses on Nurses, Doctors and other health care workers, but at the same time nursing students in clinical duties are at high risk. Studies are available which examined NSI only in Medical students and health care workers. The present study is aimed to measure the occurrence of needle stick injury along with post exposure measures and evaluation of the knowledge regarding needle stick injury among nursing student. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in North-East India in 2013. The study participants comprised of 83 nursing students studying in 4th year B.Sc. (N) and 3rd year General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM). Students were questioned regarding their occurrence to Needle Stick Injury throughout their clinical training and measures taken following the exposure. They were also asked to complete the Knowledge questionnaire on NSI. RESULTS: The study among 83 nursing students included 43 (51.81%) GNM 3rd year and 40 (48.19%) B.Sc. Nursing Students. Out of a total 83 students, 75 (90.36%) were females. The occurrence of NSI during their course was reported by 33 (39.76%) participants. The maximum NSI occurred during first year of course (57.57%). It was found that 18 (54.54%) of NSIs were not reported. Among those exposed, only 5 (15.15%) students had undergone blood investigation and very few students took post exposure measures. It was found that, only 23 (69.69%) students were immunized against Hepatitis B before NSI. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated a high incidence of needle stick injuries among nursing students with more under-reported cases and subjects were not aware of post exposure measures. It is essential to deal above problems by regular training on real-life procedure at the entry level and reporting system should be more user-friendly platform.

%X Issue: An academic medical center with 10 ICUs and nearly 200 ICU beds had an aggregate CLABSI rate of 6.3/1,000 central line days (CL) in 2009. When public reporting of CLABSI rates was initiated in 2010, our hospital was identified as a poor performer. Project: In 2009 CLABSI prevention became a primary focus in the hospital. From the bedside nurse to the Chief Medical Officer and hospital President, healthcare workers and leaders were engaged in CLABSI prevention efforts. While several CLABSI reduction efforts were developed and instituted at an executive level, many others were unit-based. For each ICU, an Infection Preventionist (IP) and Hospital Epidemiologist partnered with a unit-based nurse and physician champion, meeting regularly to discuss all bloodstream infections providing real-time feedback and identifying potential opportunities for improvement. This relationship became a platform for development of unit-based prevention efforts and culture change. Regular feedback and competition among ICUs to be the unit with the longest streak of weeks without a CLABSI increased each unit's commitment to best (Figure presented) practices. The IP team conducted routine prevalence surveys and audits of all central venous catheters, dressings and CL insertion checklists. The IP and Hospital Epidemiologist team participated in monthly educational sessions for new resident teams as well as informal team huddles for bedside staff, providing education and emphasis on the issue of CLABSIs, and elevating involvement of front line staff. Culture change was critical for implementation of evidence based practices. Results: Collectively, the ICUs had a 65% reduction in CLABSI rates over two years from July 2009 to June 2011. During that time, CLABSI rates among the Trauma ICUs decreased by 71% (from 9.3 to 2.7 CLABSIs per 1,000 CL days), in the Surgical ICUs by 64% (5.5 to 2.0), in the Medical ICUs by 55% (5.8 to 2.6), and in the NICU by 83% (4.3 to 0.7). CLABSIs per patient months dropped 70% while lab detected bactermias were reduced by 50%. Lesson Learned: What began as a small group of healthcare workers collaborating over CLABSI rates led to a hospital-wide change in culture around patient safety and infection prevention resulting in a 65% reduction in CLABSIs, avoidance of 132 CLABSIs, saving 26 patient lives and over 2 million US dollars over 2 years. In an academic institution with 10 distinctively different critical care units, supporting solid organ transplants bone marrow transplants, complex emergency surgeries and level III trauma and level III neonatal care, the challenge to reduce CLABSI initially seemed overwhelming. Leadership support of unit based efforts and internal competition were powerful adjuncts to the best practices that had been recognized by all as far back as 2009. Improvements and reductions in CLABSI occurred due to the persistent efforts of both leaders and front line staff.

%X Relevance: The MDTea podcast provides a free to access educational resource for all healthcare professionals looking after older adults and is mapped to the knowledge skills framework for NHS staff. Purpose: To develop free, open access educational material for the whole MDT on ageing. To develop a community of practice within the digital space which will translate to better clinical working within teams in practice for older adults in all healthcare settings. Approach/evaluation: The MDTea podcast produces short (30 minutes) episodes on topics commonly encountered with older adults presenting to healthcare professionals, such as dizziness, pain control, continence and falls. Each is freely available on a website, through free subscription sites or a mailing list - ensuring all levels of digital literacy are accounted for. Active engagement with social media is used to develop the online community of practice. AnMDTfaculty representing physiotherapy, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physician associates, geriatric doctors and nurses governs the content. Each episode maps to curriculum frameworks for each MDT discipline so they can be used as CPD for revalidation. Results: In the first 7 days following release, the podcast received 250 downloads, and trended in iTunes charts (science and medicine). Numbers of listeners continue to grow. Followers on twitter and facebook total 355 and 126 respectively. Tweets gained 35,000 impressions in the last month with a peak engagement rate of 11.8%. While the majority of our audience is currently UK based, 9% were from USA or Canada, with additional activity noted from Norway and Spain. We will present further up-to-date details. Outcomes: • Funding has been obtained from Health Education Kent Surrey and Sussex to create this series of 20 episodes. • We have established a multiprofessional faculty to oversee the podcast development. • Show structure based on educational theory. • A growing audience of multi-professional learners from around the world engaging to develop a community of practice through social media platforms. • We have received endorsements from several professional societies including the British Geriatrics Society and the International Association of Physical Therapists Working with Older People. Discussion and conclusions: Podcast audience numbers tend to grow over the first year of development as the audience 'finds' the content. However, we have gained a large audience quickly, demonstrating that there is a real desire for multiprofessional education, directly relevant to the workplace. We feel there is a significant disparity between the formal learning structures in healthcare (disciplinary based) and the workplace and situational learning that takes place (all in teams of healthcare professionals). Podcasts are one means of straddling this divide to provide useful healthcare education to all members of the multi-disciplinary team. Impact and implications: • Informal feedback in form of tweets and emails from individual listeners regarding relevance of podcasts and use in their workplace to date. • Steadily increasing listeners and followers. • An educational resource directly relevant to the day to day practice of physiotherapists and the teams they work within. • We have demonstrated that free open access educational materials are a useful and relevant tool for the multidiscplinary team, which has not been attempted before.

%X INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: CoP models in the context of cancer surgery have been previously described as “regional collaboratives” structured to link Quality Improvement initiatives to individual and group professional development. This platform has the potential to greatly enhance the collaboration within the multidisciplinary cancer team both at the intra-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary levels to improve the quality of cancer surgery care. We describe the successful implementation of a novel regional prostate cancer surgery model designed to provide high quality care in a defined geographic region (Champlain Region of Ontario; population 1.2 million). METHODS: In 2006, the Champlain Regional Prostate Cancer Surgery CoP formed with representatives from five hospitals, 3 of which perform Radical Prostatectomy (RP). The CoP includes all surgeons performing RP, pathologists and radiologists from each hospital, hospital administrators, a regional CoP Advance Practice Nurse and a designated nurse care facilitator at each hospital. As a result, the following keys to improving quality of surgical care were identified: regional infrastructure; development of a comprehensive Cancer Assessment Clinic (CAC); regional participation in Multidisciplinary Cancer Conferences (MCC's); development of cancer surgery standards; and sharing of performance data at regular regional workshops. Here we will present prospectively-collected performance data and quality initiative measurements. RESULTS: Over the 5 year period from 2006-2010, regional utilization of a locally created Assessment Guideline is now 100%. Participation in MCC's has increased by 280%. A central CAC opened in 2007. Utilization uptake of a standardized regional Clinical Pathway has gone from 40% to 70%. Individual surgeon case volumes and margin status data are presented regionally every 6 months. PT2 positive margin data improved at every hospital in the CoP. For Hospital 1 the pT2 positive margin improved from 18% in 2006 to 9% in 2010 (212 cases per year). Hospital 2 improved from 31% to 17% (43 cases per year) and Hospital 3 from 50% to 25% (26 cases per year). CONCLUSIONS: The Champlain Regional Prostate Cancer CoP represents a unique model of healthcare delivery linking continuing professional development to implementation of evidence-based standards in order to facilitate quality improvement initiatives in prostate cancer surgery.

%X Objective: To expand health professional involvement inMDS as an inter-disciplinary forum dedicated to research, education and collaboration between the Health Professional (HP) and physician members of the Movement Disorder Society. Aim: To enrich and broaden the scope of care, management and research initiatives in movement disorders. Background: The majority of MDS membership is neurologists; 3415 neurologists vs. 122 health professionals (3%). Previous attempts at integrating educational offerings for Health Professionals were not well-endorsed due to limited membership, sparse offerings, disinterest, lack of employer support, cost. A webpage started in 2009 where the 2010 survey of other HPs was posted. The MDS has made this expansion a strategic goal 2010-2013. Methods: Based upon previous work of the MDS HP website initiative, The 2010 needs survey was developed to document demographics, culture of learning in country of practice, multi-disciplinary team learning attitudes and unmet educational needs. The survey was conducted via the MDS web-site.Web-page advertisement was also conducted via The European Huntington Disease Network (www.ehdn.org) and Parkinson Study Group (www.parkinson-study-group.org). Results: 1) 57% of respondents were not MDS members. 2) The majority of responders were nurses and physical therapists. 3) Consensus: Multi-disciplinary treatment is a better approach to care. 4) Cost and time are the biggest deterrents to continuing education. 5) Multi-disciplinary team members should include: Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Neurologists, Nurses, OT, PT, Nutritionists, SLPs and Social Workers. 6) Educational needs are as diverse as the various disciplines; however, the most common desire is to learn more about multi-disciplinary based care. Conclusion: Outreach to potential members is for improved patient outcomes. Interdisciplinary research is needed to support a multi-disciplinary model. Education models need to be developed to allow professional learning with minimal cost and time commitment. This expansion project is possible in conjunction with web-site development through e-learning/virtual society participation.

%X Background: Surgical resection is mostly the definite treatment of liver lesions. Despite recent advances, morbidity rates remain high. Operation planning promises to achieve oncologically safe resection margins and ensure maximum residual liver tissue. We present a new, interactive and immersive method of visualizing preoperative planning data with a 3D virtual reality framework using a head-mounted display (HMD). Methods: A sample case of a patient who underwent liver resection was selected. We segmented the liver, gallbladder, vasculature, bile ducts and the liver tumors from computed tomography images. We used the HMD to visualize the intraoperative anatomical situation in the abdomen. By using the HMD the surgeon could access the 3D visualized upper abdomen, clinical patient data and the original CT images. We evaluated user satisfaction, acceptance and potential by an online questionnaire. Results: We evaluated the system with attending surgeons (n=13), resident surgeons (n = 34), medical students (n = 57), surgical nurses (n=52) and non-medical staff (n = 22). In total 180 evaluations were performed. 89%of the users were satisfied with the virtual reality scene, 90%saw its potential to better evaluate complex surgical cases, 87%found it useful in the training of medical students, 85% in surgical training and 56% in the training of nurses. Eighty percent saw high clinical potential of this technology. Conclusion: 3D surgery planning and simulation in combination with immersive virtual reality can prove beneficial for complex liver resections. It may also help younger surgeons to better understand the underlying anatomy of a surgical case and the reasoning behind the surgical decision-making processes.

%X Objective. - To determine if short-term exercise reduces falls and fall- related injuries in the elderly. Design.-A preplanned meta-analysis of the seven Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques (FICSIT)-independent, randomized, controlled clinical trials that assessed intervention efficacy in reducing falls and frailty in elderly patients. All included an exercise component for 10 to 38 weeks. Fall and injury follow-up was obtained for up to 2 to 4 years. Setting.-Two nursing home and five community-dwelling (three health maintenance organizations) sites. Six were group and center based; one was conducted at home. Participants. - Numbers of participants ranged from 100 to 1323 per study. Subjects were mostly ambulatory and cognitively intact, with minimum ages of 60 to 75 years, although some studies required additional deficits, such as functionally dependent in two or more activities of daily living, balance deficits or lower extremity weakness, or high risk of falling. Interventions. - Exercise components varied across studies in character, duration, frequency, and intensity. Training was performed in one area or more of endurance, flexibility, balance platform, Tai Chi (dynamic balance), and resistance. Several treatment arms included additional nonexercise components, such as behavioral components, medication changes, education, functional activity, or nutritional supplements. Main Outcome Measures. - Time to each fall (fall- related injury) by self-report and/or medical records. Results.-Using the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox model that allows multiple fall outcomes per patient, the adjusted fall incidence ratio for treatment arms including general exercise was 0.90 (95% confidence limits [CL], 0.81, 0.99) and for those including balance was 0.83 (95% CL, 0.70, 0.98). No exercise component was significant for injurious falls, but power was low to detect this outcome. Conclusions. - Treatments including exercise for elderly adults reduce the risk of falls.

%X Introduction: In most cases, hands of caregivers are the vehicle for the transmission of germs to the patient. Therefore, it is crucial to help medical staff and healthcare workers acquiring the skills necessary for optimal hand hygiene (HH) in order to ensure quality of care and patient safety. Objectives: To give the caregivers a training tool well adapted to their needs and integrated into a blended learning (class and distance). Methods: The Hygiene Prevention and Infection Control (HPCI) Unit - Vaud, the Preventive Medicine Service of Center Hospital Universitary of Vaud (SMPH) in partnership with the collective of the Federation of Vaud Hospital, the Commission e-learning of University to Lausanne, the Center for Education and Audiovisual Communication, have developed an interactive training module of HH in 3 steps. Conception: - Identification of the academic content. - Development of a teaching strategy fitted to any learning styles. - Selection of the interactive teaching resources. Development: - Development of academic learning content. - Development of practical content (care situations cut out in various interactive e-lessons). - Tutorial construction (integration of multimedia elements and interactivity). Implementation: - Module overview by infection control professionals in Vaud institutions. - Module provision through training platforms (Moodle, MyTeacher). - The Module is freely accessible on the Internet. Results: After a brief theoretical reminder (common to all healthcare workers), the module content covers aspects of skills through simulation exercises. Care situations are specific for each category of professionals (doctors, nurses). Throughout the course, a knowledge assessment evaluates the benefits of training. Conclusion: The training module meets the predefined goals. This e-learning module broadens infection control class offer and is part of the five areas of the WHO multimodal HH strategy. The educational effectiveness will be evaluated after 9-12 months by a query filled up by the caregivers, by the participation rate, and by reality in practice (assessed during audits).

%X Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre developed and implemented a physician-focused web-based patient sign-out application in January of 2005 with 40 different groups throughout the hospital now using it. More groups are continuing to request access to the system, including nursing and other multidisciplinary groups. The success of the system is attributable to its simplicity and usability as there is rarely any downtime and no formal training for physicians is ever necessary. The next step is to create an electronic discharge summary program. Using an electronic system to complete discharge summaries will allow more efficient completion of discharge summaries, improve the quality of discharge summaries and improve the timeliness of delivery to the family physician. Integrating the electronic discharge summary program with the current sign-out application is a logical approach because the two processes follow each other in the flow of care, information from the sign-out application is transferable to the discharge summary and both processes are essential for maintaining the continuity of care.

%X Tissue banks provide a core facility that enable translational research to be undertaken on quality-assured patient-donated samples. These samples require clinical and pathological annotations to allow comparisons to be drawn between the research-generated data and the conventional pathological and clinical outcome parameters. The challenge is to develop a flexible database system to capture these parameters and to provide a statistical framework for automated analysis. Various database solutions have been developed to capture the data at the numerous stages of research. A tissue banking platform allows complete tracking of samples as they are frozen, extracted and released, combined with an independent pathology database to capture the pathological and clinical outcome data for all breast cancer patients. This web-based interface allows the appointed research nurse to submit data as they are approved at the Mult Disciplinary Team Meetings. The patient records are also routinely checked to capture any data relating to disease recurrence, treatments and surgical procedures. A digital pathology database is also used to capture and store the tissue microarray results. All of these databases are then combined using another locally designed system, INSPIRE, which brings all the data together to perform statistical analyses and present the results via a user-friendly, web-based interface. The various systems developed allow tissue-banked samples to be tracked throughout the research process and to be annotated with high-quality pathology and research-derived data. INSPIRE then completes the cycle by aggregating these data to perform statistical analyses and present these in a user-friendly, web-based interface. This allows the researcher to focus purely on generating high-quality research and enhancing our knowledge in breast cancer.

%X Background: Chronic ulcers affect roughly 60,000 Irish people, at a total cost of €600,000,000, or €10,000 per patient annually. By virtue of their chronicity, these ulcers also contribute a significant burden to tertiary outpatient vascular clinics. Objective: We propose utilizing mobile phone technology to decentralise care from tertiary centres to the community, improving efficiency and patient satisfaction, while maintaining patient safety. Methods: Bespoke mobile software was developed for Apples iPhone 4 platform. This allowed for the remote collection of patient images prospectively and their transmission with clinical queries, from the primary healthcare team to the tertiary centre. Training and iPhones were provided to five public health nurses in geographically remote areas of the region. Data were uploaded securely and user end software was developed allowing the review and manipulation of images, along with two way communication between the teams. Establishing reliability, patients were reviewed clinically as well as remotely, and concordance analysed. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussion. Results: From October to December 2011 eight patients (61-83 yrs, mean 75.3 yrs) with chronic venous ulceration and their five public health nurses were recruited. Data were transmitted using 3 G, Edge, GPRS and WiFi, at a mean speed of 69.03 kps. Concordance was 100% for wound bed assessment, 80% for skin integrity/colour and 60% for exudate assessment. Focus group analysis explored the concept, practicalities and future applications of the system. Conclusions: With an evolving national data network, the secure transmission of clinical images is a safe alternative to regular clinic appointments for patients with chronic venous ulceration. With further development, and packaged as a freely downloadable application, this has the potential to support the community care of chronic wounds. © 2013 Quinn et al.

%X Background: Chronic ulcers affect roughly 60,000 Irish people at e600,00 or e10,000 per patient annually. We propose utilising mobile technology to decentralise care from tertiary centres to the community, improving efficiency and patient satisfaction, while maintaining safety. Methods: Bespoke mobile software was developed for Apple's iPhone 4 platform. This allowed for the remote collection of patient images prospectiively and their transmission with clinical queries, from the primary healthcare team to the tertiary centre. Training and iPhones were provided to five public health nurses (PHNs) in geographically remote areas of Cork/Kerry. Data was uploaded securely and user end software developed allowing the review and manipulation of images, along with two way communication between the teams. Establishing reliability, patients were reviewed clinically as well as via transmitted images, and concordance analysed. Qualitative data was collected from PHNs through focus group discussion. Results: From October to December 2011, eight patients (aged 61-83 years, mean 75.3 years) with chronic venous ulceration and their five PHNs were recruited. Data was transmitted using 3G, Edge, GPRS and WiFi at a mean speed of 69.03kps. Concordance was 100 % for wound bed assessment, 80 % for skin integrity/colour and 60 % for exudate assessment. Focus group analysis explored the concept, practicalities and future applications of the system. Conclusions: With an evolving national data network, the secure transmission of clinical images is a safe alternative to regular clinic appointments for patients with chronic venous ulceration. With further development, packaged as a freely downloadable application, this has potential to support the community care of chronic wounds.

%X EBM is 15 years old. At present the main challenge seems to be to overcome the problems that prevent EBM from being widely adopted by physicians, nurses, and health managers. Several methods for teaching and learning EBM have been evaluated and an open debate on their efficacy is underway. EBM teaching must be considered as a preliminary step to the continuing medical education process and a prerequisite of continuing professional development aimed to making learning relational, ethical, and managerial skills easier. The Continuing Medical Education Office of the Autonomous Province of Bozen, Italy, started an educational programme aimed at disseminating the evidence-based approach in healthcare. Hospital doctors, general practitioners, nurses, psychologists and health managers must gain, apply, integrate, and share evidence-based knowledge in order to improve patient health. This paper reports the encouraging preliminary results of the Project, and explains the relevance of sharing and accessing a virtual medical library, integrated by consistent e-learning courses and by a series of educational meetings among a small number of participants. It also describes the next steps for completing the educational project.

%X Human Patient Simulators (HPS), electronically controlled mannequins as patient models, are increasingly being used in nursing education. However, no studies have validated the influence of systematic practice with HPS on clinical performance of nursing students. This pilot study attempted to identify the nursing clinical practice parameters influenced by HPS by evaluating the clinical performance of 12 senior second degree BSN students in five categories: safety, basic assessment skills, prioritization, problem-focused assessment, ensuing interventions, delegation and communication in a complex two-patient, simulated assignment. Students who practiced with the HPS in addition to their usual clinical training had significantly higher scores than the control group (usual clinical training alone) on Patient Identification (a subcategory of the safety category; p = 0.001), and on Assessing Vital Signs (a subcategory of the basic assessment category; p = 0.009). The control and intervention groups' performances were similar in every other category. Replication of this pilot with a larger sample is recommended.

%X Description: Background: Most Americans experience hospitalization in the last year of life. Unwanted medical interventions near the end of life, and their associated costs, have been a national concern for decades. Hospital palliative care consultation programs increase health care value by helping to ensure that patients do not receive unwanted treatments. However, the size of the palliative care specialist workforce relative to need creates obstacles to routine access for seriously ill patients. In recent years, palliative care specialists have articulated principles of ''generalist'' or ''primary'' palliative care reflecting core components that can be delivered by non-specialists. Integrating Primary Palliative Care into Frontline Hospital Care The frontline hospital clinician is a crucial partner in hospitalbased efforts to significantly expand the palliative care workforce and augment the consultation model, with the goal of meeting needs that routinely arise for seriously ill patients. Hospital medicine is the fastest-growing medical specialty in the United States. Nationwide, 44,000 hospitalist physicians, 80 percent of whom work in community hospitals, are responsible for the care of seriously ill hospitalized patients from admission through discharge, and for improving patient outcomes and health care utilization. Hospital medicine has developed award-winning models to translate safety and quality targets into clinical practice. The Society of Hospital Medicine (SHM) has now joined forces with The Hastings Center, the source of landmark Guidelines on treatment decision-making and care for seriously ill people, to develop a model to integrate primary palliative care into normal hospital care. The SHM-Hastings Center team convened a national stakeholder meeting in July 2015 on ''Improving End-of-Life Care in the Hospital,'' which produced a concept map of major themes, priorities, and challenges in translating proven processes of palliative care consultation into frontline clinical work. Designing a Primary Palliative Care Pathway for Hospital Medicine: Result An interdisciplinary Expert Panel of hospitalists, health care ethicists, and experts in acute-care nursing from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) collaborated to design a care pathway to support hospitalists initiating a key component of primary palliative care: discussing prognosis and goals of care and ensuring that patients' hospital and posthospital treatment and care are aligned with their preferences. The Expert Panel's work builds on research and insights from palliative care, patient safety, and quality improvement. This focused interdisciplinary effort to articulate and establish a new norm in hospital medicine aims to fill a pressing need for a practical, sustainable model to deliver high-value primary palliative care in the hospital setting. Next Steps The new pathway, practice standard, and implementation tools will be publicly available as a quality improvement Resource Room on SHM's web-based platform starting in Fall 2016, and will be shared through professional meetings, journals, and other dissemination venues. Future research will study implementation to create recommendations for model adaptation and refine evaluation metrics to support wider use.

%X OBJECTIVES: This study sought to improve incontinence care in nursing homes (NHs) by administering and evaluating a webinar course that provided extended instruction to help NHs implement toileting trials in accordance with recommended procedures. Of particular interest was: 1) whether the course design would prompt NH staffs to implement the recommended protocol, and 2) whether participants preferred this course design to other models. DESIGN: The study collected descriptive evaluation data. SETTING: The setting was comprised of seven NHs. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were staff members, typically nurses, from enrolled NHs who attended at least three of the six webinars that comprised the course. MEASURES: Data was collected using a course evaluation and implementation survey. RESULTS: Staff in the participating nursing homes attended an average of 4.85 webinars, with an average of nine staff members attending each webinar (range: 3-20). Twelve of 16 responding participants said they preferred the webinar course to other course designs. All respondents said they would recommend the course and take a similar course again. All facilities submitted some evidence that staff providers had completed implementation assignments. Most facilities reported plans to sustain use of the recommended protocol. CONCLUSION: This study found limited evidence that the webinar course prompts NHs to implement a recommended toileting trial protocol and is preferred to other training program designs.

%X Background: The “nurse decision coach” intervention (DECIMS) aims to redistribute health professionals' tasks in supporting immunotherapy decision making processes by people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), following the principles of shared decision making. Currently, a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is performed to test the intervention's efficacy. This pilot study aimed to test the randomisation procedure and to gather data on feasibility to inform the main trial. Methods: Programme development followed the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions and was evaluated through a pilot-RCT and an embedded process evaluation. A convenient sample of 75 PwMS (age ≥ 18 y) with suspected or relapsing-remitting MS facing an immunotherapy treatment decision was recruited in two German MS centres between March 2014 and June 2015. PwMS were randomised to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). PwMS in the IG received decision coaching by a trained nurse, in the CG care as usual. Both groups had access to an evidence-based online information platform. Nurses were not blinded to group assignment, while PwMS and physicians were kept blinded. Primary outcome was 'informed choice', using a multi-dimensional measure including the sub-dimensions risk knowledge (questionnaire assessed after 14 days), attitude concerning immunotherapy (one question assessed after physician consultation), and treatment uptake (survey after six months). Secondary outcomes included an analysis of videotaped coaching videos assessing shared decision making. Results: In total 73 PwMS were included, 38 in the IG and 35 in the CG. Groups were comparable at baseline. Data of 49 PwMS were available for the primary endpoint calculation. A difference was shown with 15 of 29 (52%) PwMS in the IG achieving informed choice after six months compared with 6 of 20 (30%) PwMS in the CG, which was not significant. Analysis of coaching videos showed good levels of PwMS involvement in the coaching process. Process evaluation analysis showed a positive response of PwMS, nurses and physicians towards the intervention. Conclusions: The innovative approach of delegating treatment information provision to trained nurses using evidence-based patient information has the potential to change current doctorfocussed practice in Germany.

%X Background: Due to the growing number of immunotherapy options, treatment decision making has become more complex for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). During recent years, MS specialist nurses have been established, but are not widely integrated into immunotherapy decision-making processes. The “nurse decision coach model” has been developed to redistribute health professionals' tasks in supporting patients' decision making processes following the principles of shared decision making (SDM). This innovative approach of delegating treatment information provision from physicians to trained nurses has the potential to change current doctor-focussed practice. Aims: It is hypothesized that decision coaching by specialist nurses, including evidence-based information and support to reflect on the information and review options, will facilitate informed choice, decision quality and decisional adherence. Methods: The programme development follows the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions und will be evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled trial and an embedded process evaluation. Nurses will be trained on evidence-based information, SDM, and coaching. 300 Patients with suspected or definite relapsing remitting MS facing an immunotherapy treatment decision will be included. Patients in the intervention clusters will receive up to three decision coaching sessions with the specialised nurse and up to two physician consultations. An internet-based evidence-based information platform, a patient workbook and a coaching manual have been developed to guide the counselling process. The intervention was piloted in two German MS centres with four nurses and 12 patients. Results: The nurse training has been tested with four MS Nurses and showed satisfactory results. Nurses improved on average from 28% to 42% (mean) correct answers in a knowledge test, which has been developed to evaluate the nurse training. SDM and Coaching subscales showed an improvement from 21% to 41% (mean). Telephone feedback from five patients indicates a positive response towards the programme. No patient found it problematic to receive information on treatment options from a nurse. Two of the nurses were enthusiastic about their new roles while the others were ambiguous. Pilot study data will be available at the conference. Conclusions: The pilot-phase shows promising results concerning acceptability. The main trial with 10 German MS centres will start in March 2014.

%X Background/Objectives: The majority of new paediatric oncology cases are diagnosed in low and middle income countries (LMICs), yet the survival rates lag significantly behind those of high income countries. This disparity in survival may be attributed to limited access to effective chemotherapy, late diagnosis, and lack of education amongst health care workers. Clinical in-service training in Botswana is typically centered around short workshops which rely heavily on didactics with limited bedside reinforcement. While this method has been effective for general topics, it may have limitations as a platform on which to increase lasting knowledge in subspecialty areas such as paediatric oncology. Design/Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of a sustained paediatric oncology nurse education program at Princess Marina Hospital (PMH) in Gaborone, Botswana. Variables of interest included pre- and post-test scores, and satisfaction evaluations, of the course participants. Results: The 16 week paediatric oncology nurse training course at PMH covered a broad range of topics including cancer presentations, treatment side effects and supportive care, oncology emergencies, and palliative therapy. Didactic sessions were reinforced with bedside rounds and case presentations. The facilitators included paediatric oncology physicians, oncology trained nurses, and the hospital dietician. A baseline knowledge assessment revealed an average score of 54% (32%-64%) and the average post-test score was 98% (96%-100%). A satisfaction survey of course participants revealed an average score of 4.3 out of a high of 5. The main suggestions for improvement amongst the participants were for an extension of the course length and the addition of a “hands-on” procedural skills session. Conclusion: Sustained paediatric oncology nurse training at PMH resulted in an improvement in clinical knowledge and confidence amongst the course participants. We plan to increase the number of paediatric nurses participating in future training sessions and hope that this will translate into improved management of oncology patients on the ward.

%X BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease whose health outcomes are related to patients and healthcare professionals' decision-making. The Diabetes Intervention study in the Canary Islands (INDICA study) aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of educational interventions supported by new technology decision tools for type 2 diabetes patients and primary care professionals in the Canary Islands. METHODS/DESIGN: The INDICA study is an open, community-based, multicenter, clinical controlled trial with random allocation by clusters to one of three interventions or to usual care. The setting is primary care where physicians and nurses are invited to participate. Patients with diabetes diagnosis, 18-65 years of age, and regular users of mobile phone were randomly selected. Patients with severe comorbidities were excluded. The clusters are primary healthcare practices with enough professionals and available places to provide the intervention. The calculated sample size was 2,300 patients. Patients in group 1 are receiving an educational group program of eight sessions every 3 months led by trained nurses and monitored by means of logs and a web-based platform and tailored semi-automated SMS for continuous support. Primary care professionals in group 2 are receiving a short educational program to update their diabetes knowledge, which includes a decision support tool embedded into the electronic clinical record and a monthly feedback report of patients' results. Group 3 is receiving a combination of the interventions for patients and professionals. The primary endpoint is the change in HbA1c in 2 years. Secondary endpoints are cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications, quality of life, psychological outcomes, diabetes knowledge, and healthcare utilization. Data is being collected from interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations, and records. Generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements will be used to analyze changes in outcomes. The cost-effectiveness analysis, from the healthcare services perspective, involves direct medical costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and two periods, a 'within-trial' period and a lifetime Markov model. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are planned. DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial aims to set up the implementation of evidence-based programs in the clinical setting for chronic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial.gov NCT01657227.

%X Objective Parents who have a child newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) must quickly learn daily diabetes self-management. An RCT was conducted using human patient simulation (HPS) to enhance parents learning diabetes self-management with children with new-onset T1D. The purpose of this study was to describe parents’ perspectives of using HPS to augment diabetes education. Methods A qualitative descriptive design was used with open-ended in-depth interviews of parents (n = 49) post-intervention. Qualitative directed content analysis was used. Results The majority of parents were positive about learning with HPS. Although a few parents said the HPS was “hokey” or “creepy,” most reported the visual and hands-on learning was realistic and very beneficial. Seeing a seizure increased their fear although they would have panicked if they had not had that learning experience, and it helped build their diabetes self-management confidence. Recommendations included teaching others with the HPS (grandparents, siblings, babysitters, and school nurses). Conclusion HPS-enhanced education is an acceptable and viable option that was generally well-received by parents of children with new-onset T1D. Practice implications The technique should be studied with parents of children with other chronic illnesses to see if the benefits found in this study are applicable to other settings.

%X Postural stability decreases with ageing and may lead to accidental falls, isolation and a reduction in the quality of life. The age at the onset of postural derangement, its extent and the reason for deterioration are poorly known within an individual, but in general it becomes more severe with age. In order to prevent falls and avoid severe injuries the postural derangement has to be noticed by the person and the possible nursing personnel. In this work we propose such numerical features, which can discriminate the persons having good or poor postural stability. These features can also be utilized to measure the outcome and progression of balance training. With these postural stability algorithms providing stability features for a subject we managed to classify correctly the type of stance on the force platform in more than 80% of sixty subjects. We used k-nearest neighbor algorithm as an intuitive baseline method and compared its results with those of support vector machines and hidden Markov models. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X Patient dignity is a complex yet central phenomenon. Disrespect for dignity can mean retention of sick role, loss of self-care and control, decreased participation and therefore influence healing. At the same time, nurses have an obligation to respect dignity, and patients expect it. In clinical practice, with the focus on efficiency and economy, dignity can be compromised. The surgical patient may be particularly vulnerable to loss of dignity, when focus is solely on surgical procedure, efficiency, and productivity. The aim of the article is to describe the characteristics of the importance of dignity perceived by four surgical patients at a university hospital in Denmark. The hermeneutic phenomenological approach of Van Manen is used to analyse and interpret data collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews. The interviews explored the lived experience with two women and two men who had undergone a surgical intervention in a Danish vascular surgery department. The thematic analysis led to the basic theme: "To be an important person" illustrated by the themes: "Being a co-player," "Over exposure," and "To swallow the bitter pill." The findings provide a better understanding of patient's perspective of dignity, which is characterized by a complex interaction of several factors. Nurses should be concerned with balancing expectations, values, and opinions to maintain dignity in nursing and create a common platform for collaboration. This collaboration makes it possible for patients to be involved and have a voice in relation to nursing, treatment, and administering of time even though it could be at the expense of the terms of the system.

%X Introduction: Consultation intervals of COPD patients are currently based on personal judgement of the treating physicians, disease severity and patient preference. By this routine, important disease events (e.g. acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD)) are recognised belatedly. By earlier detection of these, emergency admissions and emergency hospitalisations could possibly be reduced. Different studies investigating multidisciplinary COPD-management programs supported by telehealthcare have shown conflicting results. The objective of the present study is to test the feasibility and establish telehealthcare to optimise care for COPD patients. Methods: COPD patients daily entered their perception regarding the disease answering a structured questionnaire, which is focused on the detection of AECOPD using the electronic health care platform 'Evita' by Swisscom, which has been adapted for this project by the study team and Swisscom. All entered data were daily analysed by the study team (pulmonologist and nurse), who called the patient by phone in case of suspected AECOPD for further evaluation. Results: Of 339 screened patients, 48 (14.2%) were included. Main reasons for exclusion were missing technical equipment (27%) and not being interested in participating (23%). Mean age was 63 years; mean follow up was 231 days. Primary endpoints: data completeness was 87.6% (9819/11083 patient days); 93.8% (45/48 patients) completed the study. Secondary endpoints: with the current 'alarming' system, we identified 60 AECOPD in 22 patients. 2 AECOPD were not detected by this algorithm. The sensitivity of the procedure in detecting AECOPD was 96.8%; specificity was 98.3%, positive predictive value 26.1% and negative predictive value 99.9%. No patient died. We conducted 230 telephone calls in 38 patients with a mean duration of 3.8 minutes. Conclusion: Telehealthcare for COPD is feasible in a selected subgroup of COPD patients, missing technical equipment being the main exclusion criterion. Eligible patients show an excellent compliance of 88% completely entered data and a high acceptance with 94% of patients completing the study. The current telehealthcare procedure has a very high sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting or excluding AECOPD, while the positive predictive value is low. The last aspect can lead to a disproportional expenditure of time and has to be improved by refining the intervention algorithm.

%X The 21st century has ushered in many new trends and tools in education. A myriad of articles, Web sites, and books offer enticing possibilities that Web 2.0 tools may increase learner engagement, improve interactivity, and allow tailoring of education to the learner. Classroom training is trending downward, and Web-based training is on the rise. But is the Internet really the answer to educators' prayers, or is it just another flash in the pan? The sheer number of technological tools and delivery methods available can be mind-boggling. This article reviews some of the basic terminology and tools that are readily available for use in delivering education via the Internet. Benefits and barriers associated with e-learning are discussed from the evidence found in nursing and education literature and the personal experiences of a nurse educator in a multihospital system. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

%X Background and aims Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) in PICU used to be done by nephrology nurses. From September 2011 PICU nursing staff took over the responsibility for CRRT. In March 2013 anticoagulant treatment changed from heparin to citrate. Our PICU pioneered in the Netherlands starting the citrate treatment in small children, performed fully by PICU nurses. Methods Before 2011, on average 1-2 patients annually required CRRT. The chronic dialysis unit was closed in 2011 and acute CRRT was transferred to PICU. Because of small numbers we decided to train a dedicated team of 20 nurses. Training program and protocols were designed by 2 senior PICU nurses, supported by nephrologist and Baxter-representative. Dedicated team members were trained using e-learning and scenarios. Training was repeated bi-annually. A prospective database was set up, registering all patient and dialysis characteristics. Results Increased use of CRRT was noticed due to (1) lower threshold to start CRRT (2) increased number of oncology patients in our hospital due to centralization. Twenty-one patients, of which 10 infants and toddlers, underwent citrate dialysis, for 221 days totally. Advantages of CRRT performed by PICU nurses were: shorter downtime from over 6 hours to median of 1.7 hours (IQR 1.0- 3.0) and increased knowledge of medical and nursing team. No serious side effects were seen, like citrate-lock, alkalosis (median pH 7.43, IQR 7.35-7.47) or execution errors in CRRT. Conclusions Trained PICU nurses can perform acute CRRT safely and more efficiently.

%X INTRODUCTION: Communication during transition of care (ToC) must be correct, complete and efficient since loss of important information can compromise patient care. The need is magnified in crisis situations. We developed patient simulation (PS) scenarios to assess and improve the quality of the ToC process of anesthesiology residents. The aim of this PS project was to assess whether the use of a cognitive aid (CA) improves the quality of the ToC process in crisis. METHODS: Rapid response PS scenarios were developed by the authors. After IRB approval residents were randomly assigned to scenarios in which he/she assumed care of an unstable patient. A bedside nurse provided essential patient information and remained available to answer questions. Following this report, the patient deteriorated further allowing the team leader to guide the team through an ACLS code. After stabilization, he/she provided a verbal ToC report to the intensive care unit provider. The resident performance during the scenario was video recorded. Completeness and quality of the ToC process were assessed by seven expert faculty from two institutions using checklists and Likert scales. The completeness score is reported as percentage from the maximum score. Leadership, organization and communication skills were assessed by a point system, with the score expressing the percentage from the maximum score. Intervention measurements (with CA) were taken 8 months after baseline measurements (without CA) to avoid participant recall. Statistical analysis was performed using mean ± SD, and paired t-test with statistical significance set at p<0.01 to compare ToC at baseline and Toc with cognitive aid. A linear mixed model was utilized to account for the nested structure of the data and investigate the associations between all data collected RESULTS: Completeness scores increased with the use of CA. The scores for communication, organization and leadership also benefitted from use of the CA, suggesting that the CA might provide a structure for the ToC process. (Table 1). The linear mixed model analysis indicated that there were no differences in scores from the training versus the non-training institution. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a cognitive aid improved the completeness and quality of ToC process of anesthesiology residents when assessed by expert faculty from different institutions. Further studies and refinement of the cognitive aid are needed to optimize the impact and format of the tool, and to assess its impact on both individual and team performance during ToC in crisis situations.

%X Background: Cancer Care Ontario is the government agency responsible for improving cancer services across Ontario's 14 regions. To promote advances in best practices related to systemic treatment, Cancer Care Ontario hosts annual Systemic Treatment Safety Symposia, which serve as a platform to discuss quality and safety issues and results of quality improvement (QI) initiatives in alignment with the Systemic Treatment Provincial Plan. For the first time, the 2015 Symposium brought together patients and providers to discuss gaps and opportunities for improvement in relation to toxicity management (TM) during chemotherapy. The main goal of the event was to define improvement priorities. Methods: The Symposium presents a valuable engagement opportunity with regional stakeholders including medical oncologists, nurses, pharmacists, administrators and patient and family advisors. An interactive agenda was designed to elicit direction from these stakeholders. At the event attendees identified and prioritized improvement opportunities using a simulated investment scenario, where marked bills were given to participants to finance the solutions they felt would best address the challenges posed by current TM. The mock money was counted and analyzed based on the role of the 'investors' and the prioritized theme. Results: The Symposium had 92 attendees including 17 patients and caregivers. Themes that emerged are presented in the Table below. Endorsement varied depending on stakeholder group. For example, Access was the top improvement priority for patients, whereas Communication was highest for providers. Conclusions: A one day engagement event that brings together patients and providers can be successful in identifying priority areas for quality improvement. Based on the outcomes of the prioritization exercise, improving access to oncology providers for TM 24/7 was identified as a focus area for provincial and regional QI initiatives. (Table Presented).

%X Aim and objective. To explore undergraduate nursing students' experiences of High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation. Background. Use of simulation as an educational tool is rapidly gaining popularity. Simulation provides a safe learning environment and helps overcome difficulties securing sufficient clinical placements. However, several limitations have been identified with this approach, particularly in relation to cost and authenticity. Design. Exploratory qualitative methodology informed the development of knowledge in this under-researched area. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with 21 nursing students and first year graduates. Participants had experienced High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation during the program. This involved their lecturer simulating a patient by adopting mannerisms and behaviours of a person, based on a predeveloped character and using masks and appropriate clothing to establish the visual image of a simulated patient. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify main areas of interest to participants. Results. Two main themes are reported in this paper: 'realism of the character' and 'skills of the teacher'. Characters presented to students were viewed as realistic which enabled participants to engage with the character and take the process seriously. Knowledge and skill of the teacher was used to direct student learning experience and maximise learning benefits to be gained. Conclusion. High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation was perceived by student participants as a highly effective teaching tool. Participants found the experience positive and believe it impacted on the quality of learning experiences. Relevance to clinical practice. Clinical experience is necessary for the development of safe and competent registered nurses. Simulation has been acknowledged as a useful adjunct to clinical experience, particularly when placements are limited. High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation may be used to promote realism, enhance student learning and contribute to an increase in clinical competence and confidence in nursing students. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Scheduling interprofessional team-based activities for health sciences students who are geographically dispersed, with divergent and often competing schedules, can be challenging. The use of Web-based technologies such as 3-dimensional (3D) virtual learning environments in interprofessional education is a relatively new phenomenon, which offers promise in helping students come together in online teams when face-to-face encounters are not possible. The purpose of this article is to present the experience of a nurse-midwifery education program in a Southeastern US university in delivering Web-based interprofessional education for nurse-midwifery and third-year medical students utilizing the Virtual Community Clinic Learning Environment (VCCLE). The VCCLE is a 3D, Web-based, asynchronous, immersive clinic environment into which students enter to meet and interact with instructor-controlled virtual patient and virtual preceptor avatars and then move through a classic diagnostic sequence in arriving at a plan of care for women throughout the lifespan. By participating in the problem-based management of virtual patients within the VCCLE, students learn both clinical competencies and competencies for interprofessional collaborative practice, as described by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.

%X Introduction Medical education has undergone major changes along the years. Until the mid 19th-century, academic medicine was based on the observation of facts; possible treatments were derived from this observation. Currently, the teaching of medicine involves the continuous search for new methods to accommodate novel requirements. Parallel to this search, one of the biggest challenges for the teaching of medicine is the evolution of technology. In surgery, for example, the advent of laparoscopic techniques has translated into the need for abilities that are quite different than those applied in conventional procedures, and the training of surgeons has relied increasingly more on simulations environments. Objectives One of the tools that allow these simulations is Virtual Reality (VR). Considering this context, the objectives of the present work were to develop a VR environment for the teaching of surgery at the undergraduate level, to reflect on the impact of this type of tool for the education of medical students and to consider the feasibility of establishing a graduate program focused on the development of VR environments applicable to medicine. Methods A multidisciplinary team was formed, and a pre, trans, and post surgical VR environment was developed. This environment allows students who have never been in contact with a surgical unit to complete various tasks relating to the performance of a thoracotomy and to learn about the rules and routines associated with a surgical unit. Results A preliminary assessment with 15 medical students and 12 professionals (five physicians, five computer scientists, and two education specialists) showed that both these groups considered the overall virtual experience as satisfactory or very satisfactory (scores 7-9 in a 10-point scale). The VR environment developed in this study will serve as a basis for other applications, such as additional surgical modules to replace the thoracotomy module. The environment may also be adapted for the training of other target publics, such as nurses or nursing students, nursing assistants or others. Conclusion Despite the complexities associated with the development of VR tools, the undeniable need to provide students with more opportunities for training, the inexorable ingrowth of technology into medicine, and the importance of integrating all this into an opportunity for education, lead to the conclusion that this project was successful and that the research line established with the present work is extremely promising.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore global practices in the use of social media in a range of health professional educational contexts and to differentiate between the practice preferences of educators and students. Methods: In 2013, an International, Interprofessional research team made up of educators and students from eight Universities across the Universitas 21 consortium collaborated on the design and implementation of this study. Following ethics approval from the participating universities, a SoMe survey hosted on Fluid Surveys was opened in April 2014 to health professional students and educators from The University of British Columbia, University College Dublin, University of Birmingham, University of Nottingham, Fudan University, University of Hong Kong, The University of Melbourne and Tecnologico de Monterrey. Professions represented included physiotherapy, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and public health. This presentation will use descriptive statistics to summarise the formal and informal use of social media in health professional education and explore the difference between student and educator preferences and social media behaviours. Results: By the 23rd October 2014, 1528 participants had completed the survey with educators making up 15.3% and students the remaining 84.7% of the sample. Results highlighted different practice preferences between educators and students. For example, 47.8% of the educators reported 'never' or 'rarely' using social media, with only 28.1% using it 'often' or 'almost always'. In contrast 18.2% of students reported 'never' or 'rarely' using social media and 55.3% reported using it 'often' or 'almost always'. Educators reported using social media to predominantly share learning resources (31.8%), deliver audio-visual materials to learners (28.4%) and to facilitate interactive learning (27.3%). In contrast students reported using it primarily as a tool to share resources (57.3%), to share opinions or frustrations related to coursework with other students (50.8%) and for exam preparation (50.7%). Conclusion(s): Educators are less likely to use social media to facilitate learning and might not be optimising the use of this tool to communicate effectively with students. Educators need to decide if they want to harness the educational potential of social media to promote professional knowledge, skills and attributes or if they want to leave social media to students who can organise and operate their own community of learners, independent of educators. Implications: This data suggests that effort needs to be directed to educating the educators on best practice in the use of social media. The need for further policy development and policy translation to guide behaviour is also recommended. Finally, it may be time to shift from a So-Me view of social media to a “So-Us” ie Social media UtiliSation in education that promotes its use for more than a small group of tech savvy health science educators and students.

%X This study proposed to develop an Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) for senior undergraduate nursing students. This evaluation process uses a simulated and standardized format to measure synthesis of knowledge and clinical skills. The benefit of OSCE is that it provides a formative evaluation for both students and the educational institute. The study included developing case studies, identifying or developing assessment tools, hiring and training standardized patients, obtaining a testing site, and analyzing data. A total of 49 students were assessed on three of six patient simulation stations and one of two nonpatient stationary stations. Both formative and summative evaluation of the students' performance on knowledge, application of nursing process and judgment, and interview skills were conducted and used for individual feedback, as well as program evaluation. The faculty, students, and standardized patients found the OSCE to be a worthwhile experience.

%X Background Accurate clinical documentation (CD) is necessary for many aspects of modern health care, including excellent communication, quality metrics reporting, and legal documentation. New requirements have mandated adoption of ICD-10-CM coding systems, adding another layer of complexity to CD. A clinical documentation improvement (CDI) and ICD-10 training program was created for health care providers in our academic surgery department. We aimed to assess the impact of our CDI curriculum by comparing quality metrics, coding, and reimbursement before and after implementation of our CDI program. Study design A CDI/ICD-10 training curriculum was instituted in September 2014 for all members of our university surgery department. The curriculum consisted of didactic lectures, 1-on-1 provider training, case reviews, e-learning modules, and CD queries from nurse CDI staff and hospital coders. Outcomes parameters included monthly documentation completion rates, severity of illness (SOI), risk of mortality (ROM), case-mix index (CMI), all-payer refined diagnosis-related groups (APR-DRG), and Surgical Care Improvement Program (SCIP) metrics. Financial gain from responses to CDI queries was determined retrospectively. Results Surgery department delinquent documentation decreased by 85% after CDI implementation. Compliance with SCIP measures improved from 85% to 97%. Significant increases in surgical SOI, ROM, CMI, and APR-DRG (all p < 0.01) were found after CDI/ICD-10 training implementation. Provider responses to CDI queries resulted in an estimated $4,672,786 increase in charges. Conclusions Clinical documentation improvement/ICD-10 training in an academic surgery department is an effective method to improve documentation rates, increase the hospital estimated reimbursement based on more accurate CD, and provide better compliance with surgical quality measures.

%X Peer breastmilk sharing has emerged in recent years as a subject of investigation and occasional controversy. Although researchers know that thousands of milk exchanges are facilitated through milk sharing Web sites every week, there is only limited research into milk sharing practices on the ground. This study examines these practices through a 102-item online survey that asked questions about milk sharing practices, perceptions of milk sharing, and demographic characteristics. Participants were recruited through social media sites specific to breastfeeding and parenting events in Central Florida. The sample consisted of 392 respondents. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis. We found that breastmilk sharing is a complex practice, showing high levels of overlap in which some donors are also recipients, and that cross-nursing sometimes occurs simultaneously with the exchange of expressed milk. Respondents often donated and received milk from people they knew; however, exchanging milk with strangers was also common. Many but not all used the Internet to facilitate milk exchange; participants used well-known milk sharing Web sites as well as their private virtual networks. The study found that most milk exchanges happen in-person as gifts and that selling and shipping breastmilk were rare. We suggest that further research is needed on breastmilk sharing practices to inform breastmilk safety research and policy recommendations.

%X Introduction: In 2010 a commercial electronic infection control software program was introduced to assist with managing the surveillance, consultation and work undertaken by the Infection Prevention and Surveillance Service (IPSS) at Melbourne Health (MH). It is now an integral component of the infection control program. In response to a growing clinician demand for real time electronic and automated alerts and data, the utilisation of the program has expanded beyond the confines of IPSS.Method: This is a description of the expansion of an electronic software program introduced 6 years ago and its application and utilisation for clinicians and managers.Outcomes to date: The program facilitates clinician decision-making, monitors local infection trends and supports research. Automatic alerts for targeted positive blood cultures and clinical specimens are sent electronically to provide timely and appropriate medical intervention. It's used to monitor device-associated infections outside intensive care. It's electronically connected to the organisational reporting dashboard; this informs Nurse Managers of real time admissions of infectious patients and the application of appropriate isolation precautions.The program provides a platform for monitoring and alerting endoscopy staff to positive endoscope surveillance cultures. This supports staff to comply with best practice guidelines for equipment cleaning and reprocessing.Conclusion: Since its inception the scope of the electronic infection control program has steadily expanded in terms of its usability and functionality. It is easily configurable to meet a growing demand for real time infection control data.

%X To address the faculty shortage problem, schools of nursing are reexamining how they provide clinical education to undergraduate students to find ways to use faculty resources more efficiently and to maintain student enrollment. We describe a unique clinical teaching model implemented at the New York University College of Nursing. The new model currently being evaluated shifts from the traditional clinical education model, in which all clinical education is in a hospital or agency setting, to a model that substitutes highfidelity human patient simulation for up to half of the clinical education experience. This article describes the clinical teaching model and its effects on nurse faculty capacity. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X BACKGROUND: New Zealand encourages internationally educated nurses to seek registration in New Zealand to reduce local nursing shortages. Internationally educated nurses must meet requirements of the Health Practitioners Competency Assurance Act 2003, and demonstrate competency to practise through a clinical competency assessment programme. AIM: The purpose was to establish whether preceptors believe they are adequately prepared to assess nurses for whom English is a second language, and to determine the support and recognition received in the role. METHODS: Preceptor training, workload, understanding of ethical and legal accountability, and perceived organizational values, support and attitudes were evaluated via an anonymous internet survey. RESULTS: Some preceptors do not meet Nursing Council of New Zealand standards and some work environments require nurses to preceptor international nurses. Many nurses believe the role is not valued despite the high workload requirements. Training increased preceptor confidence and preparedness for clinical assessment but additional education is required to understand ethical and legal accountability within the role. Many preceptors indicated they felt pressured into recording assessments they were uncomfortable with. DISCUSSION: Enhancing preceptorship acceptance could be achieved through institutional recognition of the role's value via workload consideration, institutional recognition or financial means. Increased preceptorship training, particularly around ethical and legal issues, would encourage preceptor confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Organizations must find ways of meeting these challenges while recognizing they are responsible for the work environment of both preceptors and internationally registered nurses for whom English is a second language. A register of preceptors could provide a platform for audit and quality assurance principles, ensuring adequate education and preparation of preceptors. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Effective preceptorship requires training, recognition and support. Successful integration of international nurses depends on organizational recognition and implementation of these factors.

%X To meet the demands required for safe and effective care, nurses must be able to integrate theoretical knowledge with clinical practice (Kohen and Lehman, 2008; Polit and Beck, 2008; Shirey, 2006). This should include the ability to adapt research in response to changing clinical environments and the changing needs of service users. It is through reflective practice that students develop their clinical reasoning and evaluation skills to engage in this process.This paper aims to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a project designed to provide a structural approach to the recognition and resolution of clinical, theoretical and ethical dilemmas identified by 3rd year undergraduate mental health nursing students. This is the first paper to describe the iterative process of developing a 'blended' learning model which provides students with an opportunity to experience the process of supervision and to become more proficient in using information technology to develop and maintain their clinical skills.Three cohorts of student nurses were exposed to various combinations of face to face group supervision and a virtual learning environment (VLE) in order to apply their knowledge of good practice guidelines and evidenced-based practice to identified clinical issues. A formal qualitative evaluation using independently facilitated focus groups was conducted with each student cohort and thematically analysed (Miles & Huberman, 1994). The themes that emerged were: relevance to practice; facilitation of independent learning; and the discussion of clinical issues.The results of this study show that 'blending' face-to-face groups with an e-learning component was the most acceptable and effective form of delivery which met the needs of students' varied learning styles. Additionally, students reported that they were more aware of the importance of clinical supervision and of their role as supervisees. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Reorganization in clinical operations of a national service provider organization, Fresenius Medical Care Extracorporeal Alliance (FMC-EA), provided the opportunity to overhaul and integrate quality systems. Under the new structure, the management of acute dialysis, apheresis, open-heart perfusion, and intraoperative autotransfusion services were combined into an integrated service portfolio supported by a multidisciplinary team of nurses, perfusionists, and technicians. This communication is intended to be a concise review of the literature that establishes the foundation for the new quality system as well as a discussion of the five clinical policies and clinical procedure guidelines that govern clinical behavior in mobile, point of care, acute extracorporeal therapy services. The clinical policy standards are based on recognized essentials and guidelines published by professional organizations, federal and state government agencies, and accreditation groups. The standards list the essential behaviors that clinicians should exhibit during the provision of extracorporeal therapy procedures such as acute therapeutic apheresis. Compliance with the redesigned procedure guidelines and policies will provide the clinical practice platform for continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities, benchmarking, and self-improvement. These practices can lead to improvements in the quality of care, a decrease in medical errors, and a reduction in overall health care costs.

%X Introduction: The emergency department (ED) is a complex environment with competing priorities and ever-changing information where health professionals (HP) have little to no time during a shift to pause, discuss, and reflect on clinical experiences, policies, or new research. The nature of shift work and loss of personal time to attend formal interprofessional education (IPE) and meetings pose challenges, and online resources may have the potential to create a shared, inclusive, conveniently accessed platform for dialogue and education. The objective was to explore ED stakeholders' perspectives of current culture of IPE and value with new technology. Methods: Twelve semistructured interviews exploring new online technologies were conducted within a Level 1 trauma, academic, inner-city ED (six nurses, five physicians, one social worker). The method of constant comparison was used for analyses and included searches for disconfirming evidence. Results: Webcasts offered flexible access on shift or at home but were seen as one-directional, unengaging, and unlikely to be used. Interactive discussion forums would enable dialogue for evolving practice and new research and were preferable to webcasts, but concerns about confidentiality, moderating, and uptake by the collective would need to be addressed to ensure sustainability. An online ED centralized repository for information was considered appealing and had potential to evolve into an interactive resource. Barriers to new technology were an unwillingness to “work” off shift and the loss of face-to-face interaction. Personal engagement to discuss sensitive topics in an unhurried, nonstressful environment during IPE formal meetings and rounds was preferred. Conclusion: Introducing online technologies in the ED to support IPE and discussion should be viewed with caution. New opportunities must fill a clearly defined need, be value added, and enhance clinical practice through consolidating and simplifying existing resources. Creating a collaborative website to improve process and function as a knowledge repository may lead to a future interactive resource for shared learning across professions.

%X The Institute of Medicine;s proposed 6 aims to improve health care are timely, safe, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered care. Unfortunately, it also asserts that improvements in these 6 dimensions cannot be achieved within the existing framework of care systems. These systems are based on unrealistic expectations on human cognition and vigilance, and demonstrate a lack of dependence on computerized systems to support care processes and put information at the point of use. Knowledge-based care and evidence-based clinical decision-making need to replace the unscientific care that is being delivered in health care. Building care practices on evidence within an information technology platform is needed to support sound clinical decision-making and to influence organizational adoption of evidence-based practice in health care. Despite medical advances and evidence-based recommendations for treatment of severe sepsis, it remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. It is a complex disease state that has proven difficult to define, diagnose, and treat. Supporting bedside teams with real-time knowledge and expertise to target early identification of severe sepsis and compliance to Surviving Sepsis Campaign, evidence-based practice bundles are important to improving outcomes. Using a centralized, remote team of expert nurses and an open-source software application to advance clinical decision-making and execution of the severe sepsis bundle will be examined.

%X The use of new technologies, particularly virtual reality, is not new in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD): VR is used to facilitate the activation of the traumatic event during exposure therapy. However, during the therapy, VR is a new and distinct realm, separate from the emotions and behaviors experienced by the patient in the real world: the behavior of the patient in VR has no direct effects on the real-life experience; the emotions and problems experienced by the patient in the real world are not directly addressed in the VR exposure. In this article, we suggest that the use of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, may improve the clinical outcome of PTSD. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and real worlds: (a) behavior in the physical world influences the experience in the virtual one; (b) behavior in the virtual world influences the experience in the real one. This is achieved through 3D shared virtual worlds; biosensors and activity sensors (from the real to the virtual world); and personal digital assistants and/or mobile phones (from the virtual world to the real one). We describe different technologies that are involved in the Interreality vision and its clinical rationale. To illustrate the concept of Interreality in practice, a clinical scenario is also presented and discussed: Rosa, a 55-year-old nurse, involved in a major car accident.

Demographic change resulting in growing numbers of older adults requires a societal approach, uniting stakeholders in social innovation processes. The LL approach is an innovative research method that values user perceptions and participation in the cocreation of new products and services. The SLL is crafting a platform responsive to change. It is a learning organization facilitating community-based participatory research methods in the field. Advanced nurse practitioners are well positioned to lead the way forward, fostering interdisciplinary academic collaborations dedicated to healthy aging at home. The SLL demonstrates how nursing science is taking the lead in the field of social innovation.

%X Background: According to the 2008 Institute of Medicine report, Retooling for an Aging America, the healthcare workforce is markedly underprepared to care for the increasing numbers of older Americans. Literature also suggests interprofessional education enhances collaboration essential to good geriatric clinical outcomes. We developed the Interprofessional Aging and Palliative Care (IAPC) elective to train students in interprofessional collaboration and best practice medical care for old and dying patients. Methods: An interprofessional faculty team reviewed existing UCSF courses, the Multidisciplinary Competencies in the Care of Older Adults, and the geriatrics and education literatures to identify local needs and effective interprofessional educational strategies. Because of differing calendars across UCSF health professions schools, we developed a multi-modal, competency-based course which allows students to create individualized plans of study. Students select activities from a menu of lunchtime didactics, clinical experiences, relevant local conferences, and online learning modules. The quarterly course can be repeated for credit and is open to students from Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Physical Therapy. Communication, access to modules and post-tests, sign-up for clinical activities, and student evaluations occur via a specially designed course site on the UCSF educational web platform. Results: With the Introduction of the IAPC elective, annual enrollment increased from 8-12 nursing and medical students to 90-120 students from all programs. Mean overall satisfaction was 4.33 on a 5- point scale. Students rated course flexibility, didactics, and clinical activities most highly, with interprofessional focus and online learning modules also well rated. They reported significantly higher mean selfefficacy for each competency domain, p < .001. Conclusions: A flexible, multi-modal course structure led to a ten-fold increase in elective enrollment and improved interprofessional participation. Next steps include coordination to ensure interprofessional collaboration in clinical activities and piloting in-class interprofessional teamwork sessions to develop geriatric patient care plans.

%X High-fidelity simulation is a useful mechanism to aid progression, development and skill acquisition in nurse education. However, nurse lecturers are daunted by sophisticated simulation technology. This paper presents a new method of introducing human patient simulation to students and educators, whilst seeking to demystify the roles, responsibilities and underpinning pedagogy. The analogy of simulation as theatre outlines the concepts of the theatre and stage (simulation laboratory); the play itself (Simulated Clinical Experience, SCE); the actors (nursing students); audience (peer review panel); director (session facilitator); and the production team (technical coordinators). Performing in front of people in a safe environment, repeated practice and taking on a new role teaches students to act, think and be like a nurse. This in turn supports student learning and enhances self confidence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Australia is a diverse country with large distances between major metropolitan healthcare centres and a large number of rural and remote hospitals. This has provided some challenges in providing quality and timely clinical education to improve patient blood management with the aim of enhancing safety and transfusion practice. BloodSafe eLearning Australia (http://www.bloodsafelearning.org.au) is a national education program with a multi-tiered governance framework that provides courses to healthcare professionals involved in the transfusion chain. These include courses on Clinical Transfusion Practice, Postpartum Haemorrhage, Iron Deficiency Anaemia and Critical Bleeding (in development). The Clinical Transfusion Practice course was initially developed by the South Australian BloodSafe transfusion safety and quality improvement program after audits demonstrated that appropriate education and training could significantly influence transfusion practice.1 Aims: To design, develop and implement innovative eLearning courses based on evidence and best practice national and international blood transfusion and blood management guidelines. To facilitate and support the appropriate use of blood and blood products and to improve patient safety. Methods: Based on adult learning principles all courses are developed by a team which includes clinicians, education designers and eLearning developers. Interactive and engaging educational designs incorporate video, audio and interactive multimedia. Video interviews of professionals who provide expert advice, and case studies based on de-identified real-life clinical examples are used to enhance learner engagement and authenticity. Assessments are provided in each learning module and successful completion is recorded and certificates issued. Evaluation: External consultants have evaluated the program, in particular the Clinical Transfusion Practice course using CIPP (Context, Input, Process and Product) framework. Data collection methods were designed to collect information from a range of stakeholders including the current learners, completed course users and those who although registered, had not completed the assessments. Results: 1. 112,000 + registered learners (February 2012). 2. Multi-professional - outlined in Table 1. 3. Over 700 Australian hospitals. 4. 113 International countries, 1800 + registered learners (February 2012). 5. Incorporated into university medical and nursing curricula. 6. Consistency. 7. Enabled collaboration across jurisdictions. 8. Prevented replication of effort. 9. Cost effective. 10. Greater emphasis on aspects of blood management. 11. High quality. 12. Accessible. 13. Able to generate reports about completion of learning. Summary/conclusions: BloodSafe eLearning Australia is a unique, highly successful, free online education program. It provides consistent, evidence-based and accurate transfusion knowledge nationally. The eLearning complements clinical teaching, providing flexible access to high quality, current learning resources that are relevant to patient practice. (Figure Presented).

%X BACKGROUND: Despite the general belief that mobility and exercise play an important role in the recovery of functional status, mobility is difficult to implement in patients in intensive care units. OBJECTIVES: To compare a mobility platform with standard equipment, assessing efficiency (decreased time and staff required to prepare patient), effectiveness (increased activity time), and safety (no falls, unplanned tube removals, or emergency situations) for intensive care patients. METHODS: This observational study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from the patient or the medical decision maker. Intensive care patients were assigned to a room in the usual manner, with platforms in odd-numbered rooms and standard equipment in even-numbered rooms. Standardized data collection tools were designed to collect data for 24 hours for each patient. The nurses caring for the patients completed the data collection tools in real time during the activity. The stages of activity and the physiological states that would preclude mobility were very specifically defined for the research study. RESULTS: Data were collected for a total of 71 patients and 238 activities. Important (although not significant) descriptive statistics regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit were discovered. The unintended result of the research study was a change in the culture and practice regarding early mobility in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: Early mobility can be implemented in intensive care units. Standard equipment can be used to mobilize such patients safely; however, for patients who ambulate, a platform may increase efficiency and effectiveness.

%X The United States population is undergoing a major demographic shift, by the year 2050, it is predicted that minority populations will constitute half of the general population. This evolving population change is significant due to the overwhelming burden of disease that minorities face in the nation. Cultural competence training is currently being used to prepare practitioners to provide care to a diverse population in an effort to eliminate health disparities. With the increasing demands of the nursing curriculum and the limited time frame to prepare competent clinicians, the search continues for innovative strategies that will produce culturally competent providers. Patient simulation is a technique that replicates real-world scenarios in a controlled and nonthreatening environment. However, despite the legal and moral obligations that nurses have to provide culturally competent care, a lack of evidence exists regarding how to properly integrate simulation methods for cultural competence training into the nursing curriculum. In the nursing curriculum, patient simulation has been used mainly to teach the biomedical aspects of care with less focus on the psychological, cultural, and environmental context. The potential exists for the use of high-fidelity patient simulation as an effective teaching strategy for cultural competence training.

%X Introduction: Identification of quality and safety priorities in intensive care units (ICUs) has been previously done by leadership. The observations of the broader ICU team have been less well studied. Methods: A three question, open-ended survey was distributed employees working in or with the surgical ICU at an academic level one trauma center. Questions included the respondents role in the ICU, their opinion of the most important safety issue and the biggest challenge in their job. Responses were classified into categories by a data abstractor. Results: 168 responses were collected from administrators(n=4), ICU attendings (n=8) attending surgeons (n=14), attending anesthesiologists(n=6), resident surgeons (n=14), resident anesthesiologists(n=9), Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (n=8), Consultants(n=6),nurse practitioners(n=5), nurses (RNs) (n=30), respiratory therapists (RTs) (n=11), physical therapists (PTs) (n=8), housekeepers (n=1), and other (n=22). Thirty six percent of responders (n=61) identified no safety issues in the ICU. 107 respondents identified 111 safety concerns. The concerns included team to team communication (n=23), lack of physician availability (n=8), contact precautions/hand hygiene (n=8), inadequate training (n=7), not following protocols or orders (n=7), inappropriate sedation (n=6), admission procedures (n=6), unclear orders(n=5), patient placement (n=5), staffing issues (n=5), equipment (n=4), premature discharge (n=4), family communication, (n=4), and other (n=19). The most commonly cited concern of team to team communication was identified by 6 surgery attendings, 4 resident surgeons, 3 RNs, 3 ICU attendings, 2 anesthesia providers, 1 RT, and 3 others. Conclusions: Safety concerns were broad based and not limited by group of ICU team member. The major safety concerns identified in this ICU were team to team communication, contact precautions and hand hygiene, and lack of physician availability. This provides a strong platform for agreement and change in the ICU.

%X Background: The quality of a blood component is crucial in the guarantee of safe transfusion practices. The use of platelets (PLT) collected by apheresis has increased in the last years all over the world, due to its great benefits over random-donor PLT, especially in patients with repeated platelet transfusion needs. The São João University Hospital is the biggest hospital in the north region of Portugal and its Blood Bank collected a total of 722 Apheresis Platelet Concentrates (APCs) in 2014. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of both the quality control (QC) tests and collection efficiency during the year of 2014. Material and methods: Our apheresis platelet program includes a multidisciplinary working team formed by doctors and specialized nurses. The APCs are collected by 3 AMICUS® Cell Separator Platforms. Quality control testing parameters (volume, platelets and leukocyte count and pH at the end of shelf life) were done according to the European Council and the Portuguese laws. The collection efficiency (CE) was calculated as follow: CE = total PLT yield (1011) × 100/(pre-apheresis PLT count + post-apheresis PLT count)/2) × blood volume processed. Results: The units tested meet the criteria defined by the Portuguese laws and by the Council of Europe recommendations (Table 1). 95% of the units evaluated showed an efficiency of <55% and 75% an efficiency of <70%. [TABLE PRESENTED] Conclusions: A quality system and control is essential to provide safe blood components. Quality control of apheresis PLT collected in 2014 by AMICUS® Cell Separator Platform fully met the criteria defined by the Europe Council and the Portuguese laws. The capacity to achieve the best quality blood components with the least waste of time, blood volume processed and platelets loss by the donor is also of great importance for the blood bank. A mean collection efficiency of 74% in 2014 reflects not only the collection method itself but also the quality of our apheresis program.

%X A greater focus on recovery, health and well-being after cancer treatment including advice on diet and lifestyle changes as part of personalised care planning is a key aspect of the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative(1). Front-line staff are in a prime position, so it is vital that they can confidently provide accurate and consistent information on promoting healthy lifestyles. Previous studies have shown the nutrition knowledge of both pre-registered and registered nurses is poor, notably in relation to obesity and health(2,3), but little is known of their perceived knowledge and understanding of diet and lifestyle change in relation to cancer survivorship. The current study aimed to assess the nutrition knowledge and attitudes of nurses with respect to their level of education and the provision of advice and support for cancer survivors. A modification of a validated questionnaire(4) that included questions on the World Cancer Research Fund recommendations(5) was emailed to both pre-registered and registered nurses at Bournemouth University. Results from 102 respondents are shown in the table. (Table presented) The overall knowledge score was significantly greater for the registered than pre-registered nurses (P<0.01) although there was a wide difference in the scores observed between the pre-registered nurses. There was a positive association between age and total knowledge score (r 0.57 P<0.01). No difference was observed between level of education and total knowledge score. The link between diet and cancer was cited by 28% of respondents and only 34% chose the correct dietary recommendations for cancer survivors. Attitudinal questions found nurses to be either occasionally confident when giving nutrition advice (55%) or confident most of the time (40%). The source of their nutritional information was cited as early-life influences (71%) and the media (66%). The majority (70%) of all respondents would like further training and of these, more than half felt that using a combination of face-to-face interaction and e-learning was the best approach to provide training. Overall these findings suggest that the general awareness of the importance of diet and lifestyle issues in relation to cancer survivorship is limited. Further attention needs to be directed towards providing nutrition education and training for nurses from the evidence base. Further research is needed to understand the best approach to deliver this training at pre-registered level and as part of continued professional development.

%X To investigate the extent of consensus between faculty and students in order to benchmark appropriate sanctions for first-time offences with no mitigating factors in the area of Academic Probity by quota sampling in one cohort of medical, nursing and dental students in a Scottish university. This study reports administration of a web-based preliminary inventory derived from the international research literature to a target population of health professions staff and students. This study was conducted at Scottish University College of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Midwifery. 57 faculty and 689 students in the College in first quarter of 2009 participated in this study. 50% of medical students, 26% of dental students, 22% of nursing students and 27% of midwifery students responded; 22% of faculty responded. Administration of a preliminary 41-item inventory to 57 faculty and 689 students from a Scottish College of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Midwifery has allowed us to preliminarily rank the sanctions that are broadly agreed between the two cohorts as well as to identify a small cluster of behaviours which are viewed less severely by students than by faculty. These data will give guidance to undergraduate Fitness to Practice committees but also guidance to curriculum planners about the areas in which students may need more teaching. The results informed the reduction of the inventory and its refinement in to a 30-item e-learning tool that is being field tested for generalisability within and beyond the UK. The researchers have also been invited to adapt the proposed teaching and learning tools beyond the health professions.

%X Background: The European Multiple Sclerosis Platform (EMSP) is an umbrella organization for national multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' associations in 34 European countries. Its focus is to improve the quality of life (QoL) of individuals with MS and inform society about the challenges of living with this chronic and debilitating disease. Summary: The EMSP, which is comprised of 39 MS societies across Europe, represents the interests of more than 600,000 individuals with MS and another 1.5 million persons affected by the disease, including family and caregivers. The organization works to achieve high quality, equitable treatment and support for persons with MS throughout Europe, as reflected in its main activities and projects. These include: the European Code of Good Practice in MS; a European MS register (EUReMS); a MS Barometer to assess QoL; the MS Nurse PROfessional curriculum to provide standards for MS nurse training; a photographic exhibition entitled Under Pressure; the Believe and Achieve project which focuses on employment for young people with MS; and collaboration in World MS Day, an international MS awareness day. Key Messages: The activities and projects of the EMSP are geared towards making a difference in the lives of individuals with MS in Europe and their wider support networks, including physicians, neurologists, nurses and carers. © 2014 S.

%X BACKGROUND: In the Spring and Summer of 2016, a text-messaging intervention to titrate basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control was implemented at two safety net health care systems in New York City. The goal of the current study was to conduct a qualitative evaluation assessing barriers to, and facilitators of, implementation of the mobile insulin titration intervention (called “MITI”). METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with patients (N = 36) and physician, nursing and administrative staff (N = 19) at the two health care systems implementing MITI. Interviews were transcribed and coded by two study investigators using a codebook guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and through iterative, consensus driven content analysis. RESULTS: Patients and staff perceived MITI as convenient and timesaving for patients, easy to use, and effective at achieving its clinical goals. Patients were comfortable sharing health information via text, and felt good about communicating with their health team remotely. Interviewees across stakeholder groups felt that MITI was helpful beyond insulin titration by reminding and motivating patients to engage in healthy behaviors and improving medication adherence. Staff felt MITI worked well with existing workflows and expressed a desire to see MITI expanded to other chronic conditions. Nurses responsible for weekly titration reported initial concerns over safety/liability, time required to deliver the program, difficulties reaching patients for titration calls and the need for ongoing support/training in using the online texting platform. Perceived barriers to MITI implementation reported by providers included perceived lack of patient cell phone access or texting capabilities and patient language barriers. There was also a theme that emerged across interviewees of an unmet need for additional diabetes management support among this population, beyond insulin support provided by MITI. The project team made several modifications to MITI operations in response to these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and staff were overwhelmingly supportive of MITI and believed it had many benefits. Initial implementation of MITI should address nurse comfort, workload and training, and sites should provide ongoing support and training for nurses after implementation. Future research should explore options for integrating additional diabetes support for patients enrolled in MITI or after they are discharged from the program.

%X Regarding the impact of visceral dysfunction on quality of life, bowel and bladder management is a very important problem. The management of the patient with neurological bladder is often a source of uncertainty for both patients and healthcare personnel. Since the need of specialized training is growing, two CME e-learning courses have been developed to provide physicians and nurses competencies for the enhancement of the daily life of the patients. The present study aims at evaluating courses attendance and outcomes. Attendance data confirm the interest for both courses. The results document a pretty good objective and subjective effectiveness of the e-learning courses but low attitude to exploit he support of an asynchronous tutor. The analysis of test results gives some hints for eventual quality improvement of the courses themselves.

%X The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in measures of pretest and posttest self-efficacy following simulation-based training and to compare differences in self-efficacy between nursing students exposed to medium- or high-fidelity patient simulations. This study used a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. A convenience sample of 163 second-year nursing students was assigned to either the high-fidelity patient simulation group (n = 28) or medium-fidelity simulation group (n = 135). Resuscitation-specific self-efficacy was measured at pretest and posttest. The overall mean self-efficacy score was higher at posttest compared with pretest in both the high-fidelity group (t = 9.327, P < .001) and medium-fidelity group (t = 6.568, P < .001). Nursing students exposed to high-fidelity patient simulation reported significantly higher scores on a debriefing and recording subscale (t = 5.578, P < .001), responding and rescuing subscale (t = 5.811, P < .001), reporting subscale (t = 3.441, P = .001), and overall scale score (t = 4.737, P < .001) compared with the medium-fidelity simulation group. Simulation-based training has a positive impact on improving self-efficacy. Additional high-fidelity simulation is more effective than medium-fidelity simulation only in improving nursing students' self-efficacy. There is a need to boost the self-efficacy of the students through mastery experiences in their learning curriculum.

%X Recent research suggests that simulation education can effectively improve nursing students' practical competence and can enhance educational outcomes. But very few studies have identified the relationships between pre-course simulation and course satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pre-course simulations and other advanced learning modalities (i.e. pre-course e-learning, observation, and clinical placement skill performance) predicted students' satisfaction with an emergency nursing clinical course. Second-year Korean nursing students (N = 284) participated in an integrated clinical course consisting of self-directed pre-course e-learning, a 2-hour pre-course simulation, and an 80-hour emergency room clinical placement with observation. Multiple regression analyses found that pre-course simulation, clinical placement skill performance, observation during the clinical placement, and pre-course e-learning accounted for 47.2% of the variance in course satisfaction. Notably, pre-course simulation made the largest contribution to course satisfaction, accounting for 29.1% of the variance. Pre-course simulation, skill performance, observation, and pre-course e-learning all significantly influenced learner satisfaction. Findings suggest that integrating simulation into the clinical curriculum may enhance clinical course satisfaction.

%X Relevance: This survey investigated the experiences of nurses, physiotherapists and a variety of allied health professionals (AHP) employed by the National Health Service (NHS) related to specific learning difficulties (SpLD). Understanding issues faced by those with a SpLD in the context of the workplace and the impact on access to continuing professional development (CPD) has the potential to impact on practice and career progression making it relevant to Congress Theme 2. Purpose: To explore the experiences of nurses and AHPs with a SpLD in the NHS workplace. Methods/analysis: This was the final phase of a 3-phase evaluation. A questionnaire survey was used to investigate the experiences of nurses and AHPs, with a SpLD, working in the NHS and their transitions from education to employment. Questions were developed from the qualitative findings of phase 2, which investigated these issues in physiotherapy. Participants were recruited using social media and email via NHS North West, Higher Education Institution (HEI) and other gatekeepers. Data were summarised using tables, histograms and pie charts. Open text comments were analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval was gained from Manchester Metropolitan University. Results: As a student, more participants disclosed their SpLD to their HEI than did not disclose. However, on clinical placement and on application for an NHS post fewer disclosed and there was an even split between disclosure/nondisclosure. Once in employment, the trend was towards disclosure. Non-disclosure was related to fears of discrimination; of negative perceptions that might be held by others and that the use of assistive technology would lessen their worth in the eyes of others. Participants did not report less favourable treatment compared to non-dyslexic peers, nor did they consider that less was expected from them. Most had not experienced bullying and enjoyed supportive relationships with their co-workers. However, whilst students in HEIs benefited from academic support on campus, the same adjustment was not available on placement in NHS Trusts and once they had made transition to the workplace. Over a third of respondents felt their SpLD impacted on their ability to engage with CPD. Respondents felt that they had to ask for reasonable adjustment rather than have it provided automatically once the need was recognised. Discussion and conclusions: Data from the survey suggests that disclosure of SpLD to HEI and to employers is likely, whilst disclosure on placement and on application for employment is less likely. This seems to be related to fears of discrimination and negative perceptions that might be held by others. Non-disclosure is a barrier to the provision of reasonable adjustment. Impact and implications: Lack of reasonable adjustment related to non-disclosure or failure to provide reasonable adjustment is a potential issue for those with SpLD. It may be that career progression/success in funded CPD opportunities is impeded because some with SpLD do not have access to reasonable adjustment/assistive technology.

%X Introduction: Following the implementation of the London Stroke Strategy with concentration of care in 8 hyperacute stroke units (HASUs), HASU-specific training to support the significant increase in medical and nursing staff was needed. Simulation training provides an education platform for health care professionals to become immersed in realistic scenarios where outcome is dependent upon technical and non-technical skills. Method: A standardised, curriculum-mapped, high-fidelity, simulationtraining programme was developed across 4 HASUs. Learning outcomes included clinical (acute stroke assessment/management) and non-clinical skills (including time management/decision-making/teamwork). A mixed-methods evaluation approach was used to collect data from participants before, during and atmultiple time intervals after training and to capture differences between HASU practice and implementation of the programme and staff with different roles and experience. Results: Over a 2 year period, 152 HASU staff (70 medical; 82 nursing) participated. Quantitative analysis showed an increase in perceived selfefficacy among all candidates in the domains associated with the intended learning outcomes (p < 0.001); more so in junior compared with senior clinicians. Qualitative analysis showed nurses to find the training more relevant to clinical situations than doctors, who reported simulation to be worthwhile but not as immediately relevant. Both doctors and nurses were less able to recall and associate the learning activities with clinical practice over time. Conclusion: Simulation training may be effective in helping achieve HASU-specific learning outcomes. This project demonstrates that carefully designed simulation programmes, which are congruent with clinical practice, can provide valuable training opportunities that support patient care.

%X Objective: To investigate the educational needs and employment status of dental nurses in Scotland. Subjects: One thousand, seven hundred and thirty dental nurses with postal addresses in Scotland. Design: Structured questionnaire. Results: A 65% response rate was achieved following three mailings. The majority of respondents were employed in the central belt of Scotland although comparatively, substantial numbers were also recorded as being employed in Highland and Grampian regions. A total of 70% of dental nurses stated they were in full-time employment, with 74% of all participants reporting they were qualified. Of those who were unqualified, 17% (n = 191) were not in the process of formal training which may mean they are unable to work in the future, unless they conform to the GDC 'grandparenting' requirements. Induction training had only been received by 34% (n = 377) of this group, and a mere 21% (n = 234) reported regular CPD involvement. Of the 75% (n = 832) who responded to a question on funding for CPD, only 50% (412) received financial assistance. Geographical location for many nurses generated a number of difficulties in accessing education, and the possibility of distance or e-learning was requested by 65% of the sample. Conclusions: This study demonstrates clearly that there are many well-qualified dental nurses in employment in Scotland. However, unless structured career pathways are developed, access to education is simplified, and the problem of poor remuneration is addressed, then foreseeable problems may arise where there is insufficient enticement to encourage people to join what is an already underpopulated profession. © British Dental Journal 2006.

%X Background: The idea of using telemedical applications to evaluate patients remotely is several decades old. It has already been established that x-ray images (and magnetic resonance images) can be transferred using a personal computer and a modem, and many other such applications have been implemented. Over the past 50 years the expense and technical demands of the equipment involved in telemedicine have hindered its widespread deployment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a mobile, low-bandwidth telemedicine platform to achieve real-time postoperative visits in the home. Study Design: This evaluation was designed to evaluate the feasibility of performing a real-time clinical visit with computer and telecommunications hardware and software. A nurse and medical student (for information gathering only) made postoperative visits at patients' homes while the physician stayed at the office. Clinical evaluations were performed by using low-resolution and frame-rate video, high-resolution still images, and simultaneous telephony over a standard telephone line. These remote visits were followed by a standard visit in the office. Eleven patients were included, all of whom had undergone various laparoscopic procedures. They lived 5 to 240 miles from their surgeon. Efficiency was measured by recording the time required to capture and send data required by the physician to make a clinical decision. The time expense was measured at both the patients' and physician's locations. Technical issues were evaluated and patient satisfaction was assessed by standardized objective questionnaires. The accuracy of the evaluation at the remote visit was determined with a standard office visit. Results: No technical problems were observed. The mean total time of the housecall at the remote site was 86 minutes (range 60 to 160 minutes) and at the base station site was 41 minutes (range 21 to 71 minutes). After personnel became familiar with the system, the last three visits averaged 61 and 25 minutes at the two sites, respectively. This corresponds favorably with current time requirements for visiting nurses and office visits. The patients were highly satisfied with the home visit and, on average, rated the experience as 4.8 out of a maximum of 5. Conclusions: Followup visits in patients' homes after laparoscopic procedures can be accomplished by transmitting simultaneous voice, low-resolution video, and high-resolution still images to accurately perform postoperative evaluations over standard telephone lines, with time requirements and clinical accuracy similar to those of standard visits.

%X Background PoCT is a Laboratory Medicine's analytical/organizational modality, aimed to improve treatments near to the patient. It needs to be activated if the traditional activity is not accessible or not well-timed to the clinical condition, and if it is efficient to implement. AOUP presents a high number of PoCT (43 BGA Werfen I.L.; 115 glucose monitors Roche; etc.). Up to today, these PoCT have carried out non-monitored activity, with difficulties unknown for the Laboratory. It arises the need to activate an Operative Procedure (OP), according to ISO and Italian legislation, to regulate this process. Methods CLSI, ISO 22879, and Position Paper Study Group PoCT SIPMel helped to define the OP. The application is attributed to the Laboratory Director (LD), to the Hospital Unit Medical Direction (HUMD), to the Operative Group (OG: laboratory/ departments personnel that supervises daily activities, including the responsibility for the instrument QC), and to the Multidisciplinary Directional Group (MDG: Laboratory, HUMD, Nursing Direction, HTA, Clinical Area). The aim to MDG is to evaluate the introduction of any PoCT product/device/system, independently from the purchasing modality, and to establish the responsibilities/authorities defined in the PoCT healthcare organization. Results PoCT management with supervision/instrument remote control (hospital intranet). Without remote interfacing, control guarantee through OG's periodic check, in accordance with LD, on MDG's direction. The OG controls (administrative software) the on-the-net instrumentation's functionality, verifies QC automatically performed (in case of BGA) or manually performed by the department (in case of glucose monitors and/or other instrumentation), collaborates to solve ordinary/ extraordinary instrumentation problems. Periodically, it carries out alignment checks among analyzers positioned in different departments. Conclusions With this OP, all PoCT are included, before the implementation, in a risk management and quality assurance program, following the path MDG-HUMD-LD-OG. The interface with the Laboratory IS will guarantee all results' recovery and the complete management of the “Near the Patient Care”, within the informatics folder of the Pleiade platform.

%X BACKGROUND: Didactic lecture does not lend itself to teaching interprofessional collaboration. High-fidelity human patient simulation with a focus on clinical situations/scenarios is highly conducive to interprofessional education. Consequently, a need for research supporting the incorporation of interprofessional education with high-fidelity patient simulation based technology exists. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore readiness for interprofessional learning and collaboration among pre-licensure health professions students participating in an interprofessional education human patient simulation experience. METHODS: Using a mixed methods convergent parallel design, a sample of 53 pre-licensure health professions students enrolled in nursing, respiratory therapy, health administration, and physical therapy programs within a college of health professions participated in high-fidelity human patient simulation experiences. Perceptions of interprofessional learning and collaboration were measured with the revised Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and the Health Professional Collaboration Scale (HPCS). Focus groups were conducted during the simulation post-briefing to obtain qualitative data. Statistical analysis included non-parametric, inferential statistics. Qualitative data were analyzed using a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Pre- and post-RIPLS demonstrated pre-licensure health professions students reported significantly more positive attitudes about readiness for interprofessional learning post-simulation in the areas of team work and collaboration, negative professional identity, and positive professional identity. Post-simulation HPCS revealed pre-licensure nursing and health administration groups reported greater health collaboration during simulation than physical therapy students. Qualitative analysis yielded three themes: "exposure to experiential learning," "acquisition of interactional relationships," and "presence of chronology in role preparation." Quantitative and qualitative data converged around the finding that physical therapy students had less positive perceptions of the experience because they viewed physical therapy practice as occurring one-on-one rather than in groups. CONCLUSION: Findings support that pre-licensure students are ready to engage in interprofessional education through exposure to an experiential format such as high-fidelity human patient simulation.

%X E-learning programs offer learners flexibility, more control over their learning experience, possibilities for repetition and allows for learning to be more individualized compared to traditional teaching methods. This paper presents considerations for an interdisciplinary project to design an e-learning program for graduate students enrolled in a master's program in Advanced Geriatric Nursing. The e-learning program offers new opportunities for learners to apply theoretical knowledge and develop their skills in the process of collaborative knowledge creation. A model based on the systematic development of instruction and learning and a pedagogical framework for e-learning has guided the design process. This paper explains how the e-learning program was created and how content was developed and implemented in an e-learning environment.

%X This presentation will provide an overview of blended learning theory and describe how the current emphasis on using simulation activities can enhance this pedagogical approach and provide an engaging environment for medical imaging students. Practical sessions conducted in an on-campus radiography laboratory equipped with x-ray equipment and anthropomorphic phantoms have been used in Australian medical radiography programs for a number of years. This equipment is used by students to develop skills in radiographic imaging techniques (without patients) in a safe environment prior to a clinical placement. Over time role play has been included to provide a more realistic experience for students in regard to patient positioning and communication. The term 'simulation learning environment' has more recently been used to describe these activities. Simulation suites using high fidelity models have become a part of nursing and medical education in institutions around the world. These models have realistic features, blink, breathe and cough and will respond physiologically to the care provided by students. There are no similar high fidelity models available which are suitable for x-ray imaging. Instead, role play is used, where a student acts out the role of the patient while another manages the 'patient' and positions him/her appropriately for imaging, prior to then using a sectional model or phantom to acquire the x-ray image. Medical imaging students at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) experience a blend of didactic delivery, simulation, digital and virtual reality learning opportunities in preparing them for clinical practice.

%X Introduction: Safe and high-quality patient care delivery is critically dependent upon the engagement of bedside nurses. The fastest growing group in today's hospital workforce is the Millennial Generation, a group that has been raised in a world framed by technology. “Gamification” --the application of gaming mechanics in non-game contexts-- plays to the strengths of these “digital natives;” it can be leveraged within the healthcare arena as an innovative approach to promoting team cohesion, as well as inspiring rapid adoption of quality improvement practices. Integrating a social collaboration solution with a marketing industry-based gamification engine, we aim to enhance staff communication and improve peer recognition, as first steps to better engage and motivate nursing staff, and ultimately improve patient care quality and outcomes. Methods: We implemented a proof-of-concept pilot, pairing an existing social collaboration platform with a gamification application, in two pediatric intensive care units (cardiac and non-cardiac) within a university-based children's hospital. Participation was voluntary. A pre-pilot survey assessed nursing perceptions regarding social networking and peer-recognition rates. In Phase I individuals competed in virtual platform-adoption contests with points, leaderboards, and minor rewards. Platform usage (post, comment, or photo upload) was measured over a two-week period, and compared to the prior year. In Phase II a peer-recognition application was introduced, with competition between four shift-based “teams.” Recognition metrics were compared pre- and post-pilot. Results: 124 nurses were eligible to participate in the pilot. Pre-implementation, 13% had used the university social collaboration platform. Usage increased to 37% with Phase I, and to 54% with Phase II. Posts per eligible staff member increased from 0.19 to 0.58 to 1.95, and comments per staff member increased from 0.10 to 1.63 to 1.84, respectively. Presence of a personal photo increased from 0 to 24% to 33%. Prior to the pilot, utilizing all available written sources, nurses reported a monthly peer-recognition receipt rate of 0.65/nurse, and 13% reported multiple recognitions. In Phase II, as measured by the recognition application alone, peer-recognitions were received at a rate of 0.81 (24% increase), with 25% receiving multiple recognitions (91% increase). Conclusions: Social gamification can enhance nursing engagement. Not only does this platform facilitate nursing cohesion through asynchronous collaboration, it may also accelerate overall nursing performance through unit/ team-based competitions. We will incorporate a bloodstream infection prevention bundle into this platform with a goal of improving both education and compliance. If successful, similar strategies could be applied hospital-wide, enhancing both intra- and inter-professional engagement, with a salutary effect on patient care quality metrics, and associated cost savings.

%X Background Patient registries adds valuable information on long term clinical drug effectiveness and safety. Patients treated to target (T2T) by the use of outcome measures have been shown to achieve a better outcome than patients receiving standard care (1). Thus ideally all patients with chronic inflammatory joint disorders should be monitored by the use of outcome measures in daily clinical practice, also advocated by leading experts in rheumatology (2). Despite these recommendations a large proportion of patients are not monitored and treated to target (3). One reason may be non-implementation of computerized systems developed to support targeted patient care. Objectives The aim of the BIORHEUMA (BIOlogic treatment of patients suffering from inflammatory RHEUMAtic disorders in Norway) project was to implement the use of validated outcome measures and the T2T strategy in daily clinical practice by the use of a designated computerized system. Further to obtain unselected real life data on clinical status and treatment practices in patients with inflammatory rheumatic joint disorders. Methods From the start of the BIORHEUMA project in 2009 the participating departments were to include and monitor patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), in particular patients on biologicsusing the GoTreatIT Rheuma system (www.diagraphit.com). This abstract present data on how many patients have been registered at the participating centers in 2010 and in 2011 and the estimated theoretical maximal number of patients eligible for assessment. Results End of 2011 10 out of 16 eligible rheumatology departments (≥3 rheumatologists) were participating, serving approximately 3/4 of the Norwegian population (3.7 million aged >20 years). In 2010 a total of 8059 RA, 1596 PsA and 1925 AS patients had been registered. The figures for 2011 were 10363 for RA, 2612 for PsA and 3072 for AS. The total number of patients possible to include calculated from published prevalence figures in Norway for RA (∼0.5%), PsA (∼0.2%) and AS (∼0.2%) would be for the complete country/participating departments ∼18500/13875 for RA, ∼7400/5550 for PsA and ∼7400/5550 for AS. The current completeness of the GTI platform end of 2011 is thus about 75% for RA, 47% for PsA and 55% for AS. The most successful departments including patients in the BIORHEUMA project are using nurses and health care secretaries in addition to physicians to collect data and update the database in the daily follow up practice of patients. Conclusions Our experience with the BIORHEUMA project is thatclinical patient-monitoring and establishing patient registries can successfully be achieved in one work flow when facilitated by the use of designated computerized system. This way of working catching “real life data” improves patient care on the individual and on the group level and comply with the demands from health authorities to provide efficient care and report on quality.

%X Purpose - Blue-collar manufacturing workers are more likely to have lifestyle risk factors, including a lower intake of fruit and vegetables, for the development of chronic diseases. The purpose of this paper is to assess the effects of worksite health-promotion interventions on fruit and vegetable intake among manufacturing workers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions and makes recommendations on best practices. Types of interventions and theoretical frameworks used in the workplace are reviewed, and findings are presented through research examples. Research for this paper was conducted using PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO. Findings - Positive results were found for the effectiveness of interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.Multiple levels of intervention, an emphasis on employee participation in planning, higher self-efficacy, and social support were found to be effective. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this review included self-reported data on fruit and vegetable intake. Also, determining if one intervention was more efficacious than another was difficult when multiple interventions were used within a study. Questions have been raised regarding the long-term impact of increased fruit and vegetable intake among employees. Practical implications - When planning programs, multiple levels of intervention will be needed to increase fruit and vegetable intake among workers. Also, employee participation should be emphasized when planning and implementing programs. Originality/value - The use of manufacturing companies should be considered as a platform for health-promotion programs. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake has the potential to impact numerous blue-collar workers to help reduce the risk of chronic disease.

%X This paper describes the activities of the Consortium of E-Learning in Geriatrics Instruction (CELGI), a group dedicated to creating, using, and evaluating e-learning to enhance geriatrics education. E-learning provides a relatively new approach to addressing geriatrics educators' concerns, such as the shortage of professionals trained to care for older people, overcrowded medical curricula, the move to transfer teaching venues to community settings, and the switch to competency-based education models. However, this innovative education technology is facing a number of challenges as its use and influence grow, including proof of effectiveness and efficiency. CELGI was created in response to these challenges, with the goal of facilitating the development and portability of e-learning materials for geriatrics educators. Members represent medical and nursing schools, the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, long-term care facilities, and other institutions that rely on continuing streams of quality health education. CELGI concentrates on providing a coordinated approach to formulating and adapting specifications, standards, and guidelines; developing education and training in e-learning competencies; developing e-learning products; evaluating the effect of e-learning materials; and disseminating these materials. The vision of consortium members is that e-learning for geriatric education will become the benchmark for valid and successful e-learning throughout medical education. © 2007, The American Geriatrics Society.

%X Introduction: In Spain the incidence of cancer in adolescents considering ages between 15 to 19 is around 450 cases. Then number of patients treated in our unit, Niño Jesús Hospital, Madrid, above 12 in 2013 was 28, which is around 30% of all patients seen. Nurses detect needs that are different from those of our smaller patients, we detect these different needs because we are beside patients 24 hours a day. Being concerned about this situation, we started working wiht the Spanish Asssociation of Adolescents and young adults with cancer (AAA). Last year a Nurse Board was created and we took our first steps. Objectives: Investigate needs of nurses attending adolescentes and young adults with cancer and at the same time, needs that nurses may detect of these patients. Method: A survey was submitted for nurses from different hospitals in Spain. 46 hospitals answered the survey. 20 items were studied in the survey that were divided into 4 points: Training, information, resources and needs, our proper needs and the needs we think that adolescents and young adults have. Results: We received 46 surveys of responsibles of the units, and 234 surveys of assistant nurses. 40% of the units were pediatric units and 60% were adult units. Resources: adolescentes and young adults should be treated at pediatric units 60%, at adult units 46%. 88% of the facilities do not have an specific area for adolescents and young adults. Information: 80% did not know where to acceed to information resources for adolescentes and youg adults, and information resources to assist professionals. 100% considered that it would be interesting to have a website or similar available to guide and seek questions about these patients. Training: only 31% of nurses think they have enough training and knowledge. 97% consider that specific training is important. 46% of the total of nurses feel unqualified. 93% consider that adolescents and young adults with cancer need our attention, and 100% think that it is neccessary to develope specific care teams for adolescents and young adults. Needs: 60% of the nurses do not know about their rights. 88% believe that adolescents and young adults should receive all the information of their disease and treatment and 96% consider that they must take decisions and participate with the team. Conclusion: Nurses need training, specific health education for professionals including treatment and care, physical, psychologycal and social development of this group and a platform to guide professionals and patients. Nurse board of AAA is organizing a course for Spanish professionals that will be held on May 2015 and is participating at the AAA platform providing expert information. Efforts in Spain must continue, to create the adecuate environment, units for adolescents and young adults with specific care and listening to their greatest desire that is to “keep their life as normalized as possible”.

%X Background: The Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) Massive Transfusion Registry (ANZ-MTR) collects observational data on all patients with critical bleeding (CB) requiring massive transfusion (MT) at participating hospitals. The ANZ-MTR now has data on >4300 patients collected from 22 sites in ANZ. On a biannual basis hospital data reports (HDR) are distributed to local investigators (LI), summarising patient profiles, the frequency of MTs, bleeding contexts in which MT occur, management and clinical outcomes (including survival) at each site. Aim: To evaluate if HDRs are being used to inform policy, practice, and quality of care in MT events; and to receive structured feedback on the content and presentation of the HDRs. Methods: An evaluation survey consisting of 16 multiple choice questions on the presentation, content and quality of MTR HDRs was designed using the SurveyMonkey platform. An email invitation with the study description and survey link was sent to 46 transfusion specialists, nurses/practitioners, LIs and CEO's at 20 participating sites. Survey results were collected and stored electronically. Results were analyzed using SPSS v.22 statistical package. Results: A total of 30/46 invited participants from 14 sites responded to the survey, representing an overall response rate of 65%. Of the respondents, 40% identified themselves as transfusion nurses/practitioners, 20% as transfusion laboratory scientists, 13% as anaesthetists, and the remaining were transfusion medicine specialists, risk managers and one hospital CEO. More than half the respondents were happy to receive HDRs on bi-annual basis; two thirds reported that they read the report routinely. Nearly two thirds of all respondents were likely to forward the reports to hospital transfusion committee (HTC) members. Half the respondents rated the reports as excellent or very good, while 27% thought they were average. 57% of the respondents thought that reports were somewhat easy to read, while 6.7% said not so easy. To the question of whether reports made an impact on hospital policy, practice or patient outcomes, 47% were not certain if evaluation has been undertaken, others thought the reports improved understanding of blood product use in different areas, and that they were discussed at HTC meetings. The usefulness of structuring the HDR according to the ANZ patient blood management (PBM) guidelines (https:// www.blood.gov.au) to report the provision and timeliness of blood products, benchmarked against other sites was surveyed. The majority (65%) of respondents thought it would be relevant and others did not know. The vast majority (80%) of the respondents agreed that charts and figures were the best way to display the data; however an executive summary was desired. Conclusions: The study provides insights on how to improve the ANZ-MTR HDRs. Future HDR reports will be designed to reflect the feedback from the survey by reporting the MTR data according to the PBM guidelines and providing benchmarking results. More research is required to formally evaluate the effect of feedback from the registry on policy, practice and outcomes.

%X Simulation is a strategy increasingly being used to promote critical thinking skills among baccalaureate nursing (BSN) students. It has been used to a limited extent with RN-to-BSN students, many of whom take their educational program through distance delivery. The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the critical thinking of distance RN-to-BSN students who participated in a simulation designed with interactive questions. Students taking the program, either by live televised broadcast (educational television [ETV]) or by online instruction, participated in the simulation. The ETV student simulation was facilitated from a broadcast studio by faculty, whereas Internet students completed the simulation by DVD. Postsimulation students participated in debriefing sessions, which were audiotaped by ETV students and completed by Internet students using a Blackboard® discussion board. Data were analyzed using Scheffer and Rubenfeld's conceptualization of critical thinking. Findings revealed that simulation used by distance delivery cultivated critical thinking in RN-to-BSN students.

%X An inpatient glycemic control program is challenging, requires years of work, significant education and coordination of medical, nursing, dietary, and pharmacy staff, and support from administration and QA departments. We undertook a 2 year quality improvement project to assist 10 medical centers (academic and community) across the U.S. to implement an inpatient glycemic control program through an expert mentorship model translating glycemic control concepts into practice. Interventions: 1) One day site visit with a faculty team (MD and CDE) to meet with key personnel, identify deficiencies and barriers to change, set site specific goals and develop strategies and timelines for performance improvement. 2) 3 webinar follow-up sessions. 3) Web site for educational resources. Updates, challenges, and accomplishments for each site were reviewed at the time of each webinar and at progress measured at the completion of the project with an evaluation questionnaire. As a result of our intervention, 6 institution's goals were completely or mostly satisfied, 3 partially and 1 marginally. Average scores for the intervention was 4/5 and its impact was 4/5. Additional, institution specific accomplishments are in Table 1. An individualized, structured, performance improvement approach with expert faculty mentors can help facilitate change in an institution dedicated to implementing an in-patient glycemic control program.

%X Health care in the United States is facing a crisis in providing access to quality care for those in underserved and rural regions. Advanced practice nurses are at the forefront of addressing such issues, through modalities such as health care technology. Many nursing education programs are seeking strategies for better educating students on technology utilization. Health care technology includes electronic health records, telemedicine, and clinical decision support systems. However, little focus has been placed on the role of social media in health care. This paper describes an educational workshop using standardized patients and hands-on experiences to introduce advanced practice nurses in a Doctor of Nursing Practice program to the role of social media in addressing issues inherent in the delivery of rural health care. The students explore innovative approaches for utilizing social media for patient and caregiver support as well as identify online resources that assist providers in a rural setting.

%X Introduction A UK wide audit of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2007 showed overall mortality was 10% - varices were identified in 8% of these patients1. The SIGN guidelines (2008) adopted by the BSG, recommend that balloon tamponade should be considered as a temporary salvage treatment for variceal haemorrhage which has not been controlled by endoscopic and drug therapy2. Unlike previous Gastroenterology StR/SpR curricula, competence in placing and managing Sengstaken-Blakemore (SB) tubes is included in the 2010 curriculum and should be assessed by DOPS. Methods This survey aimed to determine trainee confibdence in the insertion and management of SB tubes and to suggest how training should be delivered. In addition we asked the opinions of consultant gastroenterologists. An online survey was emailed to all trainees and consultants in the Severn and South West Peninsula deaneries. Results The survey was sent to 34 trainees with a 71% response rate. 47% were ST3 or 4 with the remaining 53% ST5, 6 or SpRs. 75% of trainees have been involved in managing patients with SB tubes averaging 3 patients in the last 5 years. 96% felt SB tubes are a useful management option and 50% have seen one deployed by a senior colleague. Only 38% felt confibdent to insert a SB tube independently and 25% are confibdent to give management instructions to nursing or junior medical staff. 100% of trainees felt there should be formal training. The survey was sent to 65 consultants with a 40% response rate. 77% had used SB tubes in an average of 3 patients in the last 5 years. 96% felt trainees should be competent in inserting SB tubes and have formal training. 88% did not know if SB tubes are a component of the 2010 curriculum with only 12% saying yes. With regards to training, 46% of trainees preferred a session integrated into a regional training day, followed by 29% who wanted a study day including a model/simulation session. 35% of consultants felt either of these methods would be suitable. 17% of trainees wanted an e-learning module followed by model/simulation session. Conclusion This survey demonstrates that the insertion and management of SB tubes is a weak area in gastroenterology training. This must be addressed, particularly as it is included in the 2010 StR curriculum requiring demonstration of competence. Trainees and consultants agree there should be formal training in this skill ideally as a model/simulation session or at a regional training day.

%X Introduction: The use of simulation in health professional education has increased rapidly over the past 2 decades. While simulation has predominantly been used to train health professionals and students for a variety of clinically related situations, there is an increasing trend to use simulation as an assessment tool, especially for the development of technical-based skills required during clinical practice. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of using simulation for the assessment of competency. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to examine simulation as an assessment tool of technical skills across health professional education. Methods: A systematic review of Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), and Web of Science databases was used to identify research studies published in English between 2000 and 2015 reporting on measures of validity, reliability, or feasibility of simulation as an assessment tool. The McMasters Critical Review for quantitative studies was used to determine methodological value on all full-text reviewed articles. Simulation techniques using human patient simulators, standardized patients, task trainers, and virtual reality were included. Results: A total of 1,064 articles were identified using search criteria, and 67 full-text articles were screened for eligibility. Twenty-one articles were included in the final review. The findings indicated that simulation was more robust when used as an assessment in combination with other assessment tools and when more than one simulation scenario was used. Limitations of the research papers included small participant numbers, poor methodological quality, and predominance of studies from medicine, which preclude any definite conclusions. Conclusion: Simulation has now been embedded across a range of health professional education and it appears that simulation-based assessments can be used effectively. However, the effectiveness as a stand-alone assessment tool requires further research.

Young Adult Burn Outcome Questionnaire
%X Long-term follow-up care of survivors after burn injuries can potentially be improved by the application of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs can inform clinical decision-making and foster communication between the patient and provider. There are no previous reports using real-time, burn-specific PROMs in clinical practice to track and benchmark burn recovery over time. This study examines the feasibility of a computerized, burn-specific PROM, the Young Adult Burn Outcome Questionnaire (YABOQ), with real-time benchmarking feedback in a burn outpatient practice. The YABOQ was redesigned for formatting and presentation purposes using images and transcribed to a computerized format. The redesigned questionnaire was administered to young adult burn survivors (ages 19-30 years, 1-24 months from injury) via an ipad platform in the office before outpatient visits. A report including recovery curves benchmarked to a nonburned relatively healthy age-matched population and to patients with similar injuries was produced for the domains of physical function and social function limited by appearance. A copy of the domain reports as well as a complete copy of the patient's responses to all domain questions was provided for use during the clinical visit. Patients and clinicians completed satisfaction surveys at the conclusion of the visit. Free-text responses, included in the satisfaction surveys, were treated as qualitative data adding contextual information about the assessment of feasibility. Eleven patients and their providers completed the study for 12 clinical visits. All patients found the ipad survey and report easy or very easy to use. In nine instances, patients agreed or strongly agreed that it helped them communicate their situation to their doctor/nurse practitioner. Patients agreed or strongly agreed that the report helped them understand their course of recovery in 10 visits. In 11 visits, the patients agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend this feedback to others. Qualitative comments included: it helped organize my thoughts of recovery, it opened lines of communication with the doctor, it showed me how far I have come, and how far I need to go, and it raised questions I would not have thought of. Only four of 12 provider surveys agreed that it helped them understand a patient's condition; however, in two visits, the providers stated that it helped identify a pertinent clinical issue. During two visits, providers stated that a treatment plan was discussed or recommended based on the survey results. Separately, qualitative comments from the providers included survey was not sensitive enough to identify that this patient needed surgery for their scars. This is the first report describing clinical use of a burn-specific patient reported outcome measure. Real-time feedback using the ipad YABOQ was well received for the most part by the clinicians and burn survivors in the outpatient clinic setting. The information provided by the reports can be tested in a future randomized controlled clinical study evaluating impacts on physician decisions.

%X Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore physiotherapists lived experiences of interprofessional education (IPE) within rheumatology. Relevance: Rheumatological conditions are present in 20-24% of the UK population (Symmons et al., 1994). The nature and practice of rheumatology is that all health care professionals need to work closely together to ensure best patient management (DH, 2006). Interprofessional learning (IPL) is considered essential if the future workforce is to support the changes planned in the NHS. Rheumatology practitioners work as sole practitioners but also as part of an extensive multidisciplinary team that supports and manages complex rheumatology patients. Extending or enhancing the traditional role of AHPs within rheumatology is normally a substitution for the doctor's traditional role and is generally seen as progress (Mc Pherson et al., 2004). The University of Brighton in conjunction with Arthritis Research UK offered a unique and innovative course, the Graduate Certificate in Rheumatology Practice (GCRP). The purpose of the course was to fulfil the complex professional needs of rheumatology AHP's through IPL. This course was delivered using distance learning and teaching at specialist centres throughout the UK. It utilised national rheumatology expertise within the UK and IPL is a key component in its delivery. Participants: Three UK practising physiotherapists who were alumni of the GCRP were recruited via email to the study by purposive sampling. Methods: A qualitative study using a phenomenological approach was chosen. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used in analysing the data. Semi-structured telephone interviews lasting up to one hour were conducted on a one-to-one basis. Each interview was recorded on an analogue cassette recorder and then transcribed. Analysis: Each interview transcript was read several times and subjected to inductive coding. Emergent theme titles were produced to describe keywords and phrases within each transcript. These were then grouped together under broader headings into new lists of emerging themes across all participants. A master list of themes was developed which captured the participants' experiences. Results: Three main themes emerged from the data: 1. role and self development, 2. impact on professional practice, and 3. the learning experience. The findings indicated that the experience of interprofessional learning impacted on each participant personally and professionally, and their patient management. The participants recognised the contribution other members of the multi-disciplinary team had to their development and found that the learning environment within rheumatology was supportive. Conclusions: With the Agenda for Change initiative, extended and specialist roles are now recognised (DH, 2005). As a consequence there is a move for AHP's to extend their traditional roles. Research has shown that nurse practitioners already play an invaluable part in the delivery of modern rheumatology services (Goh et al., 2006). This study has recognised the benefit of studying interprofessionally, AHPs who cross professional boundaries have benefitted from specialist interprofessional training in rheumatology to the benefit of patient management. Implications: This study provides a platform for further exploration of interprofessional education in rheumatology and its impact on clinical practice. This is key in light of NHS policy review and recent change in government.

%X Background: Testicular cancer (TC) is a relatively curable malignancy that predominantly affects young males. Key decision makers discourage TC screening because of lack of evidence about the benefits of this practice, whereas others argue that men must be aware of normal versus abnormal testicular findings. Despite the debate on TC surveillance, a number of research efforts are still being made to increase men's awareness of TC and its screening. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review studies that were conducted to enhance men's knowledge and awareness regarding TC and its screening and increase their TC screening intentions and practices. Methods: Studies published in English between 2004 and 2014 were reviewed using 3 e-databases, and interventions that were in line with the review aims were selected. Results: A total of 3076 records were screened for eligibility, and 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the reviewed interventions successfully enhanced men's awareness of TC and its screening and increased their intentions to perform testicular self-examination. Examples include videos about TC, shower gel sachets, stickers, and posters, a television show, a university campaign, and high self-efficacy messages about TC screening. Men at risk of health disparities were underrepresented in the reviewed literature. Conclusions: A number of interesting channels through which men can learn about TC were identified. Examples include social media and mass media. Implications for Practice: Given the controversy that surrounds TC screening, nurses can play a key role in increasing men's awareness of TC rather than advising periodical TC self-examination.

%X Teaching medicine to medical students, physicians in training and nurses is a challenging task that has remained unchanged for decades. The airline industry has achieved a great deal of safety and quality in a technically challenging environment. Many believe that their outstanding achievement is due to team training and crew resource management using simulators and dedicated training programs. Many experts in the medical profession believe that adopting the same strategies in teaching medical students and trainees could achieve significant reductions in medical errors and improve the quality of patient care. This article explores the role of teaching medicine using virtual reality in a multitude of medical specialties and outlines the use of simulation training at Saint Louis University.

After the learners finished eLearning for home palliative care, some questionnaires were distributed to the learners and analyzed by us. The analysis of questionnaires revealed that almost all were satisfied with our eLearning services. Especially the learners were not only interested in using the skills of opioids and the management of pain control, but they had a good cognition for the usage of opioids.

Altogether, 24 nurse teacher candidates from four different European countries participated in the course and this study. The results showed that the knowledge of using social media applications increased during the course from 5.2 (range 1-9) to 8.1 (range 4-10), and their skills increased from 4.5 (range 1-8) to 7.6 (range 4-10).The main topics learnt during the course were divided in two categories: subjects of the course and teaching and learning methods. The students' experiences concerning the EleneIP course were positive in both categories. The international group created during EleneIP course also allowed the students to achieve another important aim, learning from a collaborative group the importance and possibilities of different learning environments, considering the cultural and social characteristics of each country participating in it.

%X Introduction: Transfusion support is part of essential care in Hematology, aiming to improve patients' quality of life. Transfusion activity represents a sizable part of our specialty due to its impact on the pronostic of hematologic malignancies. It helps patients to maintain a good performance status but also to safeguard their social life. Within the Hematology Day Hospital in our Lyon Sud Hospital Center, 25% of the global activity is represented by transfusion acts in MDS or acute leukemia elderly patients. Throughout the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, the considerable increase in the number of transfusions (+16%, then +21%) has represented a real source of disorganization for the nursing team, a lack of landmaks and considerable waiting time for mostly elderly patients. A reorganization of transfusion care was peremptory. Method: That lead to the creation of a “Transfusion Platform” in November 2014, within the Hematology Day Hospital. This reorganization began with the nomination of a transfusion nurse, with a dedicated phone number. Electronic agendas which were up until then shared were split and a transfusion-specific agenda was created. Also, a geographical “transfusion sector” was identified within the Day Hospital, with dedicated beds. This platform aims to: - identify transfusion threshold for each patient and so transfusion indication according to pre-defined and consensual criteria - re-define the making of appointments for transfusion support - foster links with “Etablissement Français du Sang” (French Establishement of Blood) with anticipated blood and platelets orders, aiming to a quick delivery of blood products - obtain a better follow-up and a better knowledge of polytransfused patients and of transfusion-related complications Results: After 3 months of test, we wanted to know how the patients, who were accustomed to the old way, perceived this reorganization. A satisfaction survey was finished, with written questionnaires. The answers led us to realize that 100% of patients thought it was a real plus to have a dedicated transfusion nurse. For them, this situation lead to “a better knowledge of patient record, better follow-up”, “support”, “protection”, “reassurance”, “better contact and relationship”. Conclusion: The creation of this platform allowed a real new dynamic around the transfusion act. In fact, we would like to invest ourselves in other projects, some of which are already in progress. Thanks to the involvement of the team, and to the cooperation of nursing and medical professionals from other French Hematology Centers, we created a new national tool “Information book for the polytransfused patient”, in printing. After reasoning about transfusion-related hemosiderosis, we are aiming to improve, and then uniform, the medical and nursing care for these side effects, with an iron chelation protocol, as to standardize medical practice.

%X Background: 46.8 million people worldwide currently live with Alzheimer's disease/related dementias (AD) and 66-70% are cared for in the community by family caregivers. Effective management strategies are available but care delivery is fragmented, inefficient, and uncoordinated resulting in excess unmet care needs, morbidity, and costs. Evidence-based approaches to dementia care that bridge medical, social, supportive care services must be an international public health priority. This objective is to provide a case example of one such model, the Maximizing Independence (MIND) at Home program, and to reflect on key learnings from its developmental path, methods and design, and challenges. Methods: Phase 1 developed and piloted a family-centric dementia needs assessment, estimated prevalence of unmet needs, and developed an evidence- based, practical intervention protocol based on identified needs. Phase 2, an 18 month randomized controlled pilot study for feasibility and preliminary efficacy, found that participants receiving MIND had a significant delay in transition from home, fewer unmet care needs, improved quality of life, and caregiver's had reduced time burden, compared to those receiving augmented usual care. Phase 3 (on-going) consists of two projects, an RCT to evaluate impact of a streamlined version of MIND on nursing home placement and societal cost, and a CMMI demonstration of an intensive version of MIND to test impact on outcomes and health care costs, to develop a web-based training platform to enhance adoption, and to develop a sustainable payment model for the Medicare/Medicaid dual eligible population. Results: From inception, pragmatic and translational considerations and design features have been iteratively incorporated into all phases of development, testing, and implementation of the MIND at Home program, with future adoption by service organizations as the ultimate goal. Critical considerations include: selection of patient-oriented outcomes/ targets; stakeholder/community partnerships and input; pragmatic design (e.g. broad inclusion criteria, diversity); use of conceptual models; multi-pronged outreach approaches; intervention protocolization, materials, and packaging; and delivery and savings cost considerations. Conclusions: MIND at Home is one example of a dementia model of care that promotes evidence-based dementia care activities; family focus; individualization; and linkage and leveraging multiple services and resources to make clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes important to patients and caregivers. Born from a grassroots coalition, lessons learned include community partners and shared vision, use of hybrid trial design for implementation and dissemination, incorporation of theory, and considerations of social and policy contexts for sustainability.

%X Nurse practitioners (NPs) have an increasingly important role in health care provision in the United States. However, most nurses report that they receive little or no clinical training in the area of developmental disabilities. A core development team consisting of NP faculty members from three universities, one physician assistant faculty member, the parents of children with developmental disabilities, and educational specialists developed two multimedia interactive pediatric instructional modules in CD-ROM format: one involving a child with Down syndrome and the other, an infant born at 26 weeks gestation. Participants were required to make decisions about proper clinical interaction throughout the cases. The modules on CD were piloted with NP students at three universities. Effectiveness study results demonstrated significant gains in both knowledge and comfort level regarding the care of patients with developmental disabilities.

Methods Improving Outcomes in Children and Young People with Cancer (NICE, 2005) recommended that nurses working in this field should be offered appropriate post qualifying specialist education. This has proved challenging for many of the tertiary Paediatric Oncology centres as local Universities cut the number of modules they offer. The Paediatric Oncology Nurse Educators group, within the RCN, have been concerned about the diminishing number of validated modules available for some time. Recently a 'shared care' hospital approached my University to ask if a validated module about children with cancer was available. Fortuitously I had the expertise and knowledge to write such a module at level 6 and 7. I made a case to serve local need and create an option module for the pre-registration nursing programme and successfully developed the module which has recruited 42 students over 3 deliveries. A Lead Children's Cancer nurse, from a different region, heard about the module and approached me to see if the module could be delivered 'off campus' to meet her local need. ELearning has been used to offer education across regional and international boundaries but the lead nurse was very keen to encourage face to face networking of tertiary centre nurses, shared care hospital nurses and community nurses. Contracts were negotiated between the Regional education commissioner and my university. I delivered the module at the Tertiary centre and attracted 14 students from the region. Specialist speakers from the Tertiary centre willingly contributed to the timetable as it was on their 'doorstep'. The evaluation of the module was very positive e.g. “Already taken knowledge gained from this course back to practice” “Great to discuss all aspects of treatment and care from tertiary, acute, DGH and community perspectives” This has been a worthwhile collaboration which has evaluated well and enabled appropriate education to be delivered 'closer to home'. Hopefully it will happen again next year!.

%X Introduction In 2008, this provincial Teaching Hospitals Trust was identified to be poorly performing for both the monitored healthcare acquired infections (HCAI) in the UK: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) & Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. Antimicrobial use in elderly patients (>80 years) already avoided cefuroxime. A consultant antimicrobial pharmacist was appointed to support the microbiologist leading on antimicrobial stewardship and an antimicrobial pharmacist. The antimicrobial stewardship strategy included: • Establishment of a Drug & Therapeutics Sub Committee for Antimicrobial Stewardship “Improving Antimicrobial Prescribing Group” • Development of web-based, evidence-based, peer reviewed, infection treatment & prophylaxis guidelines led by a clinician, and supported by a microbiologist and specialty pharmacist. • Formal audit program with supporting tools and web-based performance feedback • E-learning resource for prescribers • Formal feedback on antimicrobial usage & performance to specialty level • Restriction of broad spectrum of antimicrobials outside of guidelines or microbiology recommendation. • Development of web-based calculators for renal function and Hartford gentamicin dosing • Development of an Antimicrobial Medicines Code that required the indication and duration to be recorded on all prescriptions for antimicrobials. • Development of screen-savers and large posters to promote better antimicrobial prescribing, highlight drugs to be avoided in beta-lactam allergy, advertise the antimicrobial guidelines. • Establish a regular education programme for junior doctors and nurses. • Develop an e-mail based feedback mechanism for poor performance for primary and secondary care. • Development of IV to oral switch tools These were introduced over a 12 month period. Scientific findings • 96 guidelines were developed. These now get over 7000 hits per month • Monthly point prevalence audit undertaken on all 2000 in-patient beds each month. Patients on antimicrobials have decreased from ∼35% to ∼25%. • The number of audits by specialties of antimicrobial guidelines or prescribing in the last 18 months has been 117. Indication and duration on prescription rose from 55% and 54% to 92% and 93%. • Broad spectrum antimicrobial use decreased by 22%. • Monthly cases of CDI decreased from ∼80 to ∼20 Discussion Strong leadership is needed to successfully deliver an antimicrobial stewardship strategy. Monthly reporting of antimicrobial prescribing standards to the Trust Board meeting drive improvements in prescribing. Guidelines that focus on accurate diagnosis and appropriate investigations were well used due to the robust development process that promoted ownership, and therefore subsequent usage. The feedback mechanism ensures continual update. This has probably lead to a reduction in patients receiving inappropriate or extended courses of broad spectrum antibiotics. In addition, the monthly CDI rate is only 25% of the monthly rate for the same time two years ago. Changes in antimicrobial prescribing may have contributed towards this. Conclusions Delivery of a comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship strategy can produce a sustained reduction in broad spectrum antimicrobial usage, reduced prevalence of antimicrobial prescribing, improvement in prescribing standards, and reduction in monthly Clostridium difficile infection rates. These improvements were based around a comprehensive set of web-based antimicrobial guidelines and an education, audit and feedback programme.

%X Aims: Professionals with different curricula and roles are involved in palliative care. The present work aims to assess how their professional roles and other socio-demographic variables influence their psychological well-being, coping with death, fatigue and satisfaction of compassion. Method: In a cross-sectional study, 387 Spanish palliative care professionals were surveyed by an on-line platform. Of those, 43.4% were doctors, 33.3% nurses, 14.4% psychologists, 4.9% nursing assistants and 4.1% were social workers. Data from socio-demographic (gender, age, years of hospital experience and years of palliative care experience) and other variables (spiritual training, self-care, awareness, coping with death, fatigue and satisfaction of compassion, and well-being) were collected. c2, t-tests and simple and multiple analyses of variance were conducted. Results: When differences by gender were studied, no statistical significant relations were found. In the case of age, a negative relation was found between age and compassion satisfaction (r = -.116, p = .037). Years of experience in palliative care was positively related to coping with death (r = .124, p = .036), showing greater levels of coping for those professionals with more experience. The simple and multiple analyses of variance showed statistical significant relations among the different professions and the psychological variables. For example, there were differences among professions in the dimensions of wellbeing (F24,1260 = 1.881, p = .006) and the dimensions of burn-out, satisfaction and compassion fatigue (F12,858 = 2.878, p = .001). Conclusion: Palliative care professionals surveyed show appropriate levels of self-care, coping with death, awareness, well-being and quality of life, with differences on these psychological variables related to age, years of palliative care experience and profession. Implications of these results are discussed.

%X OBJECTIVES: Describe the use of two massive open online courses designed to provide education on patient safety. Review follow-up evaluation data from the courses. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT: Neither the planners nor the authors have any conflicts of interest to disclose. BACKGROUND: The Nursing School of the University of Cantabria conducted a training session on patient safety through two massive open online courses (MOOCs) aimed at the general population and especially Spanish-speaking health professionals. This study aimed to analyze the profile of health professionals who have completed the courses, their degree of satisfaction, and the percentage of completion. METHOD: In this retrospective and observational study, two MOOCs on clinical safety were created through an online platform (MiríadaX). Quantitative analysis of the profile of health professionals, their degree of satisfaction, and the percentage of completion was performed. RESULTS: A total of 12,400 students were enrolled, and the average completion rate was 32%. The profile of the average student was female, 37 years old, college educated, a nurse in a hospital, and interested in the course because it may be useful for performing her work. Fifty-five percent of students were very satisfied with the course. CONCLUSION: MOOCs are considered to be effective and easily accessible, with quality content for professional continuing education that encourages interdisciplinary work and meeting professionals from around the world.

%X Medical Informatics in India is still in its infancy. Although the Indian Association for Medical Informatics (IAMI) was founded in 1993, proposed by major healthcare delivery institutions, the absence of independent career options in medical informatics in India has resulted either in the exodus of the needed faculty members for supporting education in the field. However, this situation may have been changing in the past few years, but a large gap exists which needs to be filled up quickly. The purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of the present situation of research and training in medical informatics in India, and its implications for future development of the field. To assess the current situation regarding the opportunities for research and education in Medical Informatics in India and related issues like availability of career options. A survey questionnaire was sent by postal mail to well-known Indian institutions engaged in medical informatics training and research. In addition, key stakeholders working towards imparting education and awareness on the principles and practice of medical informatics were contacted to provide information about training and research in medical informatics in India. This was a purposive sampling based on prior knowledge. The responses were thematically analyzed. A total of six courses were identified in the survey. These were administered through face to face (F2F), e-learning and other modes of distance learning. In general, most of the students are graduates in medicine (allopathic, homeopathic, ayurvedic), allied sciences (nursing, physiotherapy) and medical administrators or graduates in engineering or library and information sciences. Most of them are also working, thus, the majority of the courses are for part-timers and act as on-job value addition. Most of the courses however do not directly train for jobs. Therefore, as most of the participants are already working somewhere, the question of placement due to the course may not be measurable directly. Since most of the students from India are already employed, by attending this course they gain further insights into health informatics that they want to pursue as a career.

%X Aims: eviQ provides best evidence based treatment protocols to support standardisation and optimal cancer treatment. Cancer health care practitioners also need access to high quality clinical learning programs online to ensure comprehension, competence and capability development. In support of the eviQ 'point of care' focus, eviQEd aims to provide eLearning programs for cancer professionals to support safe practice in cancer care and the provision of best evidence at the point of care. Methods: Phase 1 of eviQEd from July 2009 to September 2010 focused on establishing program governance, IT infrastructure and developing clinical content and implementation strategies to enable eviQEd to service NSW Health and beyond. This included planning for pilot testing eviQEd in two Sydney metropolitan cancer care centres. Results: A functioning governance structure consisting of an Advisory Committee and Clinical and eLearning Education expert advisory panels has been established. Pilot testing on the instructional design methodologies and implementation processes is complete, the outcomes of which have demonstrated the viability of eviQEd. eviQEd modules have been developed for managing cancer pain for acute care nursing and for medical orientation: managing cancer outpatient reviews. These two modules will be implemented and evaluated within the medical and nursing orientation programs in two cancer centers in NSW. Development of a Chemotherapy Administration Training Program, including eight learning modules, is also underway. Conclusions: eviQEd is a viable platform for the delivery of standardised point of care learning programs for cancer services. Phase 2 will complete the development and implementation of modules for medical and nursing orientation programs and the implementation of the chemotherapy administration training program.

%X STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): To assess the usability and effectiveness of a mobile app that provides residents and attendings information about all available resources in the outpatient setting, and how to access them e.g. how to refer to a certain specialty, location and hours of various clinics, residents ambulatory schedules, ambulatory curriculum lectures, insurance specific drug formularies, prior authorization protocols, and contact information of key staff like social workers, nurses, medical office assistants. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): 1. Educating health care providers (primarily residents, attendings) about available resources for patients in an ambulatory academic practice. 2. Reducing the logistical challenges care providers face, and barriers patients encounter, in accessing health care services 3. Evaluating the usability of a web-based mobile app in improving awareness and access to resources that exist within a hospital and in the community for patients. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Rapid access to logistical information necessary for patient care continues to be a challenge for all health care providers. Even common, routine resources for patients tend to have certain requirements e.g. who can be referred to a screening colonoscopy versus a diagnostic colonoscopy in your health center and how to make the referral to the appropriate team. Many resources are gained and lost quickly, based on funding e.g. prediabetes education classes. Adding to that, internal medicine residents are often in the outpatient clinic only every few weeks, which is enough time for things to have changed since their last rotation. Healthcare systems have tackled this problem in the past with paper or electronic survival guides, which can be difficult to use, access and update. Recently, a user-editable knowledge management platform (EHHAPP, East Harlem Software Company, NY) has been described in literature to consolidate logistic information into a web-based app and streamline information flow for trainees. This system's usability and usefulness have never been tested. In June 2015, Mount Sinai's Internal Medical Associates (IMA) Practice converted paper survival guides (which included specialty referral protocols, contact information, lecture schedules, staff schedules and billing information) onto the EHHAPP platform and deployed it for use by our residents and attendings primarily. The App was designed to aid primary care providers as its primary focus, however the App is accessible to all members of the health care team on their mobiles or on the desktop. After 6 months of use, we conducted a survey based on the technology assessment model (TAM) and Modified Usability Scale (MUS) to assess the effectiveness and usability of the app in helping care providers at IMA to overcome logistical challenges to providing care from the primary care setting. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): Evaluation of this intervention is ongoing and will include the following: 1. Qualitative feedback from IMA care providers (attendings versus residents) on the utility of the mobile application 2. Quantitative data on the time spent and the time saved in the referrals process using this mobile application 3. Quantitative data on the ease and comfort using this mobile application to make referrals 4. Quantitative data on the effect of the mobile application in enhancing the ability of clinicians to providing effective primary care FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): To date 35 care providers spanning residents and attendings have completed the QI survey. The application, available as both a mobile app and a webpage, was accessed mainly on a mobile device (70 % respondents did not access the app at all through a desktop). When used on a mobile dev ce 50% respondents accessed the app 1-5×/ week with 46 % respondents accessing >6×/week. Of the residents and attendings who made referrals in IMA prior to launching of the application, 64 % reported saving 1-2 h/week and 7 % reported saving >6-10 h/week by using this application. Respondents reported positive changes (>3 on a 5 point scale) in productivity (88 %), effectiveness as a healthcare provider (89 %), navigating resources for chronic disease (78 %), and getting accurate referral information (83 %). In terms of usability, respondents reported positive experiences (86 %), ease of referrals (72 %), faster referral scheduling (50 %). Additionally respondents reported comfort (79 %) and ease of locating information (50 %) with this application. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): This mobile-phone application allows primary care providers (and outpatient clinic staff) to factor in access-to-care issues when referring patients for a myriad of services in the outpatient setting. Through the creation and updating of this app, care providers can help address barriers to access and learn to navigate complex healthcare systems, particularly for vulnerable patients. Challenges for sustaining this application include keeping the application up-to-date, and updating at the beginning of the academic year due to the yearly turnover of residents.

%X Background: Smokers who make a quit attempt during hospitalization have improved long-term abstinence if they receive follow-up support, including via a telephone quitline, a free resource in the United States. Smokers are referred infrequently to this resource by healthcare providers. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a Web-based educational program (Helping Smokers Quit) on translating the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline: 2008 Update into practice. Using a Web-based survey, frequency of nurses' self-reported referral of smokers to a quitline and performance of the components of a smoking cessation intervention (the 5As: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) was compared with self-reported performance among nurses who received printed educational materials (control group) at 6 months. Methods: Nurses from 30 (n = 15 control and n = 15 intervention) randomly selected and assigned hospitals from California, Indiana, and West Virginia participated. Both groups received a toolkit of materials including a state quitline card and access to the Tobacco Free Nurses Web site; the intervention group had additional access to a project-specific Web page and the opportunity to attend a webinar. Only nurses who completed baseline and 6-month surveys were included in the analysis. Mean improvement of the 5As and refer scores and logistic regressions of consistent (usually or always) referral to a quitline were used to examine differences over time by group. Results: Pre-post data were collected for 333 nurses (209 intervention, 124 control). Mean improvement was significantly higher in Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange, and Referral to a Quitline for the Help Smokers Quit group. Nurses in the control group significantly improved in Advise and Referral to a Quitline. Consistent referral was most likely in the intervention group (OR = 1.74, 95% CI [1.11, 2.72]), especially among those who viewed the webinar (OR = 2.34, 95% CI [1.03, 4.23]). Discussion: After 6 months, nurses in the intervention group had significant improvement in the frequency of interventions and consistency of referral of smokers to the quitline. The improvement of nurses' referral to the quitline among the control group who only received printed materials demonstrates that both are effective strategies in increasing awareness of this resource. © 2012 Lippincott Williams amp; Wilkins.

%X Learning Objectives: There is a paucity of literature on the role of simulation in needs assessments (NA), including the use of simulation to determine system and institutional level gaps. There is also a general lack of qualitative studies in simulation in medical education and a need for rigorous, high quality, qualitative investigations. The purpose of this investigation was to better understand the potential of a NA approach utilizing qualitative data from high-fidelity and virtual- patient simulation debriefing sessions compared to traditional methods (i.e., focus groups and interviews). Methods: Original data from simulation debrief sessions was compared and contrasted with data from an earlier assessment of critical care needs in a community setting (using focus groups and interviews), thus undertaking secondary analysis of data. Time and cost data were also examined. Debrief sessions were coded utilizing deductive and inductive techniques. Matrices were utilized to explore the commonalities, differences, and emergent findings across the methods. Results: There were 31 participants in focus groups (12 MDs, 14 nurses, 5 RTs) and 22 participants in interviews (2 regional leaders, 7 community hospital leaders, 13 referral hospital leaders). In the simulations, there were 13 community hospital participants (6 MDs, 6 nurses, 1 RT) who formed 6 teams. Interviews and focus groups yielded 684 and 647 minutes of audio-recordings. The high-fidelity debrief recordings averaged 22 minutes (total=130 minutes) and virtual-patient debrief recordings averaged 31 minutes (total=186 minutes). Approximate cost for the interviews and focus groups was $13,560, for high-fidelity simulation debriefs was $4,030 and for virtual patient debriefs was $3,475. Fifteen of 20 total themes emerged from the simulation debriefs. Simulation-specific themes emerged, including fidelity and multiple roles of the simulation instructor. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary support for use of simulation debriefs as a NA method. Given current fiscal realities, the dual benefit of being educative and identifying needs is appealing.

%X Introduction: Rapid assessment of blood loss is vital in guiding intraoperative fluid management, but visual estimates by providers are demonstrably inaccurate. Recently, a mobile vision platform has been developed for photometric assessment of blood loss on sponges via an iPad interface [1]. Because the algorithmic analysis is performed on a remote server, the potential to use virtually any front-end device for imaging and display exists. One such device is Google Glass. As a wearable computing platform, Glass enables previously inaccessible levels of mobility and intuitive control through the use of its integrated display, camera, and speech recognition capabilities. As an egocentric vision system2, Glass also presents interesting considerations for diagnostic image analysis (e.g., repeatibility, completeness, background variability). In this pilot study, we assessed the stability of photometric blood loss measurement from images of lap sponges captured by the Glass platform. Methods: Synthetic whole blood (Laerdal, Inc. Stavanger, NO) was poured and dispersed onto an 18×18 surgical laparotomy sponge in a simulated operating rom environment. The user issued a vocal command to a Glass device, which initiated a 10s video recording of the sponge as it was held up by the user in an egocentric fashion. To vary background conditions, this procedure was repeated while facing a different direction. The captured videos were transmitted to a proprietary server where all 298 frames of each video were individually extracted, downsampled, and filtered to remove frames in which the sponge had not been fully raised into view. The two framesets were batch-processed using Feature Extraction Technology (FET, Gauss Surgical, Inc., Los Altos, USA), a novel image analysis platform, to measure Hb content from the image. The resulting prediction of sponge Hb mass (g) per frame was stored for analysis. Repeatability and stability of the measure was assessed across all image processing outputs from both framesets. Results: The mean +/- SD of Hb mass on the sponge was 1.3 +/- 0.1g in the first frameset (n = 204 extracted images) and 1.4 g +/- 0.2 g in the second frameset (253 images), sampled over two different backgrounds. Across both framesets, the mean +/- SD of Hb mass was 1.3 g +/-0.1g. The corresponding CV ratios were 4.5% (frameset 1), 11.7% (frameset 2), and 10.3% (combined), indicating low variability in the algorithm's measurement of Hb mass across variable background conditions and repeated measures. Conclusion: Wearable computing platforms have the potential to capture valuable intraoperative image data and augment user experience. The Glass platform demonstrated viability in imaging sponges for blood loss assessment with significant repeatibility and background invariance. Using Glass with Feature Extraction Technology may aid the user (e.g., circulating nurse) in their ability to rapidly count sponges and simultaneously assess surgical blood loss.

%X Objectives: Over the past four years, the Mater Children's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) has employed an average of 25 new nursing staff each year. Most of these staff do not have previous PICU experience. The PICU Education Team has devised a training strategy to prepare new staff to enter this challenging clinical area with confidence and competence to deliver safe clinical practice. Methods: Using a learner centred approach, new staff commence orientation with an individually facilitated program that includes self directed learning, problem based learning, experiential learning and inter professional learning. These strategies are achieved through the use of the structured transition program, eLearning, workshops, clinical facilitation and high fidelity insitu simulation. A pocket simulation centre located within PICU supports regular team based training and debriefing. The combination of these methods promotes and develops reflective learning practice. Results: At 12 months ofemployment staffmembers undergo a formal assessment where they are observed caring for a ventilated patient. This evaluation consistently demonstrates that new staff members have developed the necessary clinical knowledge, skills and communication to safely care for the critically ill patient in PICU. Feedback at their professional development planning session revealed that the variety oftraining strategies offered were comprehensive and beneficial. Conclusion: We believe the improved orientation strategy has been effective intraining new staff to safely and competently care for critically ill patients. We are confident this has improved patient safety, improved learning outcomes and reduced stress on new staffmembers.

%X Healthcare professional education in the last 10-15 years has witnessed a significant increase in the use of simulation technology for teaching and assessment. Multiple factors likely have contributed to this evolution, including: changes in healthcare delivery and academic environments that limit not only patient availability as learning opportunities, but also trainee work hours and time for clinical faculty to teach; worldwide attention focused on the problem of medical errors and the need to improve patient safety; and the paradigm shift to outcomes-based education with its requirements for evaluation and demonstration of competence. The use of simulators addresses many of these issues: they can be readily available at any time and can reproduce a wide variety of clinical conditions and situations on demand. In lieu of the customary 'see one, do one' approach, whereby novices carry out the practice required to master various techniques - including medication administration - on real patients (where the consequences of mistakes can be grave), simulation- based education allows trainees to hone their skills, including those needed to manage rare and/or critical situations, without risk of punishment or harm to patients. For the assessment of professional competence, simulators - by virtue of their fidelity, reproducibility, and programmability - provide a standardized testing experience, which is especially important when utilized for high-stakes determinations, such as specialty certification or licensing. Medical simulations, in general, aim to imitate real patients, anatomic regions, or clinical tasks, and/or to mirror the real life circumstances in which medical services are rendered. Our discussion here may use the term simulation, which in its broad sense includes any approximation of actual clinical situations (such as standardized patient [SP] encounters), but we will focus more narrowly on simulators, referring to particular simulation devices. These can take many forms and span the range from low- to high-fidelity, including part task trainers, virtual reality simulators, and computer-enhanced mannequins. Part task trainers consist of 3- D representations of body parts/regions with functional anatomy for teaching and evaluating particular skills, such as plastic arms for venipuncture or suturing. In most cases, the interface with the user is passive (i.e. the device is examined, or procedures are performed on it, with little more than rudimentary responses from the simulator). Although more sophisticated part task trainers may contain computerized or even virtual reality components, we nonetheless distinguish them from computerenhanced mannequins (CEMs) because the latter reproduce not only the anatomy, but also normal and pathophysiologic functions. For this reason, to the extent that pharmacology education has embraced use of these technologies, it has chiefly involved this last category of simulators. With CEMs the interface with the user is more often active or even interactive, such that simulator responses will vary according to user actions (for example, heart rate and blood pressure will change appropriately depending on the dose of a particular drug administered intravenously). Moreover, high-fidelity mannequins are commercially available that connect to actual anesthesia machines, and vital signs and other clinical parameters will vary appropriately as the concentration of anesthetic gases are adjusted or other medications are administered. The programming of these simulators obviously involves sophisticated computer algorithms and pharmaco-physiologic modeling, but when incorporated into hands-on activity with the mannequins in a simulation scenario, learning of these otherwise 'dry concepts' is no longer passive (as in the lecture hall), but becomes a highly interactive process. Moreover, the increased relevance of seeing these pharmacology principles 'come to life' in the context of (simulated) patient care enhances learner satisfaction and knowledge retention. This is a fine example of the re ent trend toward vertical curriculum integration: breaking down the traditional separation between the (earlier) basic science and (later) clinical phases of medical school training. Earlier attempts to increase interactivity of pharmacology education with 'wet lab' experiences using animals as patient substitutes faced challenges in terms of realism (imperfect modeling of human physiology and obvious differences in physical appearance) as well as ethical issues (animal welfare); the use of simulators largely circumvents these problems. As a result, these technologies are coming into greater use for pharmacology education not only in medical schools, but also across multiple healthcare professions (e.g. nursing and veterinary medicine) and at postgraduate and higher learner levels.

%X The current study compared the CathSim virtual reality simulator with simulated limbs for phlebotomy training. In the first experiment, medical students completed two 1-hour training sessions using 1 of the 2 methods. Afterward, the students' performance was assessed with both simulated limbs and genuine patients. The results showed that students trained with the simulated limbs achieved higher scores on both the posttest and the field test with actual patients than those trained on the CathSim system. In the second study, graduate students practiced with the CathSim system for 5 hours. The results showed a significant improvement in scores from pretest to posttest for these students. However, even after extended practice, their final scores did not differ from those of the medical students in the first experiment. Critical differences in design characteristics between the 2 systems may explain these findings. Although the authors observed a clear advantage for simulated limbs over the CathSim system, neither system faithfully represents all of steps needed to perform the procedure. Thus, training decisions may require that the unique advantages afforded by each system be considered. © Copyright 2006 by the Intravenous Nurses Society.

%X Patient education is crucial to guarantee that transplant recipients are capable of adequate self-management. Until recently, our education program to prepare lung transplant patients for discharge lacked a systematic approach, meaning that it was unclear whether all key information had been provided and whether the patient understood the information. A lack of coordination among the multidisciplinary team members also was apparent. (1) To map out a structured education program, outlining the content, process, and evaluation of education for patients before discharge after lung transplant; (2) to integrate this program into the patient's electronic file and pilot test this new form of education tracking. We used the conceptual framework of Lorig and colleagues, as well as the educational leaflets of the International Transplant Nurses Society, to generate the content of our education program. The interdisciplinary lung transplant team decided when and by whom each educational component should be provided, as well as the evaluation criteria. Next, information technology engineers integrated this educational program into the patient's electronic file. Nurses subsequently tested the program, and their feedback was integrated in the next version of the program. Health care providers experienced a higher level of uniformity and transparency. After using the education program, most patients indicated that they felt confident to go home. Our electronic educational platform is promising, yet further testing is necessary to evaluate whether patients indeed have sufficient knowledge and show adequate self-management skills in the long term after transplant.

%X Spirometry has become an indispensable tool in primary care to exclude, diagnose, and monitor chronic respiratory conditions, but the quality of spirometry tests in family practices is a reason for concern. Aim of this study was to investigate whether a combination of e-learning and bimonthly performance feedback would improve spirometry test quality in family practices in the course of 1 year. Our study was a cluster trial with 19 family practices allocated to intervention or control conditions through minimization. Intervention consisted of e-learning and bimonthly feedback reports to practice nurses. Control practices received only the joint baseline workshop. Spirometry quality was assessed by independent lung function technicians. Two outcomes were defined, with the difference between rates of tests with 2 acceptable and repeatable blows being the primary outcome and the difference between rates of tests with 2 acceptable blows being the secondary outcome. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for an adequate test in intervention group practices. We analyzed 1,135 tests. Rate of adequate tests was 33% in intervention and 30% in control group practices (OR = 1.3; P=.605). Adequacy of tests did not differ between groups but tended to increase with time: OR = 2.2 (P = .057) after 3 and OR = 2.0 (P = .086) in intervention group practices after 4 feedback reports. When ignoring test repeatability, these differences between the groups were slightly more pronounced: OR = 2.4 (P = .033) after 3 and OR=2.2 (P = .051) after 4 feedback reports. In the course of 1 year, we observed a small and late effect of e-learning and repeated feedback on the quality of spirometry as performed by family practice nurses. This intervention does not seem to compensate the lack of rigorous training and experience in performing spirometry tests in most practices.

%X Accumulating evidence suggests human patient simulation is an effective instructional technique. Simulated clinical experiences may be a reasonable substitute for direct care experiences. Educators and regulators need to know what mix of simulation and direct care promotes learning and how these experiences can be designed to help nursing students achieve essential outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to identify a model to promote development of clinical judgment among beginning nursing students. Principles related to types of learning and practice (blocked by type or interleaved) were used in exploring simulation and direct care design schema. Using a 50% interleaved simulation design schema, robust clinical judgment scores and positive perceptions of learning were identified among beginning students participating in a basic nursing concepts and skills course. Further study is warranted to determine whether this schema is effective in other nursing courses or with novice-level students from diverse health care disciplines. © SLACK Incorporated.

Activities include creating interactive pages on the social networking site Facebook, establishing a Facebook Beacon site and conducting social events to facilitate viral marketing of the campaign's message. The reach of these activities is measured using web metrics (number of people interacting with web materials) and the number of individuals photographed and 'tagged' in Social Action Advertisements (viral marketing). The campaign was implemented on 25/9/08 and will conclude on 30/6/09. To date 2,309/45 800 (5%) Canberra-based Facebook users aged 18 to 40 years have interacted with campaign materials. 146 young people 'tagged' their photos to create Social Action Advertisements. Canberra Facebook users average 114 friends, creating the potential for 16 644 'trusted referrals' to campaign materials on Facebook. The Beacon site has attracted 5,789 unique visitors. 8250 postcards were distributed, 27 000 copies of student publications featured the campaign; 112 000 animated advertisements were shown in shopping centres and 10,000 branded condom packs given away. Presentations were made at the ACT Public Health Forum, an ASHNA seminar and other youth and health forums. Materials were distributed to 402 GPs and 116 Practice Nurses. Several media outlets reported on the campaign, including the Nine Network's 60 Minutes program. Social and modern media enabled the Consider Chlamydia campaign to reach a large number of young women. The effect of the campaign on screening rates will be determined by analysing the rates of chlamydia testing before, during and after the campaign.

%X Purpose: In the St. Anna children hospital the apheresis procedure are carried out on the PICU. The team of the PICU exists of 15 nursing people and 2.5 doctors and the apheresis team consisted of one doctor at the beginning of our eductional ptrogram. We have examined how the educational program influenced the number of staff and the number of procedures performed in the last 17 years. Methods: The basis for the education of our operators is the QM handbook and JACIE manual from the stem cell transplantation unit in the St. Anna children hospital. To operate in our apheresis team as an operator the following qualification steps are prescribed: An examination for (1) pedriatic nursing (2) intensiv care and/or for apheresis care and (3) participation on advanced/national apheresis training (4) attendancy on a ERC training every 2 years (5) a positiv voting from the aphersis team (6) 10 apheresis procedures under survey. The theoretical training takes place once with a qualified mentor during apheresis procedure and with of internal educationals. It contains knowledge in haematology, transfusion medicine, technique of aphereses procedure (indications, risks, and troubleshooting), and specific issues regarding pediatics. In the practical part the employees receive a company enrolment on the machines, as well as all 2 years a recertification. The first 10 procedure are accompanied by a mentor, with the next aim of the independent realisation of an apheresis under supervision only. In the training we begin gradually with the procedures from the cell collection (autolog, allogen, stem cells, lymphocytes and monocytes) to the next step of the therapeutic apheresis (TPE, IA, RCE, . . .) The coures and success of the eduction is documented by a check list and an orientation talks. Results: After 17 years the ICU team is the same amount but in this team we have now a structured apheresis team with one doctor, three operators, and two apheresis nurses. We could increase with the education draught the number of our apheresis procedure with nearly constant personnel state during the last 17 years around five times. (see Fig. 1). Conclusion: This practical conversion of the operator's education guarantees a very uniform education of the apheresis care personnel for us. Therefor is this clear, structured and documented education. This offers an orientation, structure and course of her education for new team members. Also the orientation talks offer a platform around possible deficits clear to make and to compile solutions together and to make as a countermove present progress to the employee as a motivation obviously. In the course of the development of this training programme we have found out that the examination of the theory is not documented uniformly and enough. That is why we have sat down as an aim to develop a uniform multiple choice questionnaires to the knowledge examination. (Figure Presented).

%X As technological advances continue to expand connectivity and communication, the number of patients and nurses engaging in social media increases. Nurses play a significant role in identification, interpretation, and transmission of knowledge and information within healthcare. Social media is a platform that can assist nursing faculty in helping students to gain greater understanding of and/or skills in professional communication; health policy; patient privacy and ethics; and writing competencies. Although there are barriers to integration of social media within nursing education, there are quality resources available to assist faculty to integrate social media as a viable pedagogical method. This article discusses the background and significance of social media tools as pedagogy, and provides a brief review of literature. To assist nurse educators who may be using or considering social media tools, the article offers selected examples of sound and pedagogically functional use in course and program applications; consideration of privacy concerns and advantages and disadvantages; and tips for success.

%X Background: The dopamine precursor levodopa has shown some, albeit relatively weak, promise in treating cocaine dependence. This study sought to identify the most appropriate behavioral therapy platform for levodopa pharmacotherapy by evaluating its effect when administered in combination with behavioral platforms of varying intensities. Method: A total of 161 treatment-seeking cocaine dependent subjects received sustained release levodopa/carbidopa (400/100 mg bid, Sinemet) or placebo delivered in combination with Clinical Management (ClinMan); ClinMan + cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); or ClinMan + CBT + voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT) in a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (for medication condition) trial. Medication compliance was monitored with riboflavin (100 mg/capsule) and the Medication Event Monitoring System. Protocol compliance was addressed in weekly, 10-min nurse-delivered ClinMan sessions. Weekly, 1-h CBT sessions focused on coping skills training. VBRT (with escalating reinforcer value) provided cash-valued vouchers contingent on cocaine-negative urine toxicology results. Urine benzoylecgonine assays collected thrice-weekly were analyzed by intention-to-treat criteria using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Levodopa main effects were found on all outcome measures of cocaine use. Contrasts testing the levodopa-placebo difference within each behavioral platform found reliable effects, favoring levodopa, only in the VBRT platform. Levodopa treatment with vouchers produced higher proportions of cocaine-negative urines and longer periods of consecutive abstinence compared to other treatment combinations. Conclusion: This is the first study to find a significant treatment effect for levodopa and, in doing so, to demonstrate that the magnitude of this effect is dependent upon conditions of the behavioral therapy platform. The data support use of levodopa with abstinence-based reinforcement therapy as one efficacious combination in cocaine dependence disorder treatment. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X One of the outcomes of a training concept for physicians and nurses concerning pediatric emergencies at the Heidelberg University Hospital was that the work and procedures in childhood emergencies could be simplified by replacing the existing paper-based guidelines with a smartphone app. Since the project funds for this were already used up, a group of students from the master program "Medical Informatics" of Heidelberg and Heilbronn Universities took over the development of the app. Particular attention was given to the need for compatibility with the variety of devices (device size and screen resolution) and platform independence. The guidelines themselves were scripted in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS (responsive web design); managed by a container programmed in Sencha Touch. Even though the app is not yet available in the App-Store due to the limited timeframe, the students gained a great deal of valuable experience in developing platform independent software for mobile devices.

%X The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the perceived effectiveness and feasibility of using virtual reality (VR) as a distraction intervention for children, aged 10-17, receiving outpatient chemotherapy. Treatments for cancer are intensive and difficult to endure. Distraction interventions are effective because the individual concentrates on pleasant or interesting stimuli instead of focusing on unpleasant symptoms. VR is a computer-simulated technique allowing an individual to hear and feel stimuli that correspond with a visual image. Evaluation of the VR intervention demonstrated positive outcomes. Eighty-two percent of the children (n = 11) indicated the chemotherapy treatment with the VR was better than previous chemotherapy treatments. All subjects responded positively when asked if they would like to use the VR again. The intervention was easy to implement, did not require practice to be effective, and required minimal nursing time. Results from this pilot study suggest that VR as a distraction intervention has the potential to enhance positive clinical outcomes. This intervention warrants further investigation with both pediatric and adult populations.

%X The increase in heart failure (HF) rates throughout the developed and developing regions of the world poses enormous challenges for caregivers, researchers, and policymakers. Therefore, prevention of this global scourge deserves high priority. Identifying and preventing the well-recognized illnesses that lead to HF, including hypertension and coronary heart disease, should be paramount among the approaches to prevent HF. Aggressive implementation of evidence-based management of risk factors for coronary heart disease should be at the core of HF prevention strategies. Questions currently in need of attention include how to identify and treat patients with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (Stage B HF) and how to prevent its development. The relationship of chronic kidney disease to HF and control of chronic kidney disease in prevention of HF need further investigation. Currently, we have limited understanding of the pathophysiological basis of HF in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function and management techniques to prevent it. New developments in the field of biomarker identification have opened possibilities for the early detection of individuals at risk for developing HF (Stage A HF). Patient groups meriting special interest include the elderly, women, and ethnic/racial minorities.Future research ought to focus on obtaining a much better knowledge of genetics and HF, especially both genetic risk factors for development of HF and genetic markers as tools to guide prevention. Lastly, a national awareness campaign should be created and implemented to increase public awareness of HF and the importance of its prevention. Heightened public awareness will provide a platform for advocacy to create national research programs and healthcare policies dedicated to the prevention of HF. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

%X Purpose: Patient-centered evaluation is a critical but often overlooked component of intervention research. The Rural Breast Cancer Survivors (RBCS) Intervention is a survivorship education and support intervention designed for rural breast cancer survivors. Here, we describe evaluation of the RBCS Intervention from the participants’ experience. Methods: Three hundred sixty-four breast cancer survivors participating in the RBCS Intervention were asked to complete the RBCS Evaluation Survey that consisted of 6 quantitative statements and 12 qualitative questions via mail. Results: Two hundred twenty-one participants (61 %) returned the RBCS Evaluation Survey. All 221 completed the qualitative component, and 91 (25 %) completed the quantitative. Overall, participants indicated that the education materials were easy to understand and addressed their quality of life concerns. Majority (94 %) indicated that the survivorship information was helpful in making health decisions and communicating concerns to family (87 % strongly agree/agree) and oncology team (88 % strongly agree/agree). Only 66 % indicated that the survivorship educational materials were provided at an appropriate time after completion of primary breast cancer treatment. Qualitative data suggested that participants had positive perceptions and experiences and found the RBCS Intervention helpful. One-on-one interaction with the intervention nurses was the single most highly valued aspect. Conclusion: Overall, the RBCS Intervention was helpful. Education materials addressed quality of life concerns. Breast cancer survivors developed skills in communicating with their family and oncology team. Intervention nurses were identified as the most valuable aspect of the program. Suggestions include earlier timing of survivorship education and support, and adaptation using social media access to serve other rural survivors. Relevance: Patient-centered evaluations, using both quantitative and qualitative data, provide enriched understanding of evidence-based survivorship interventions and should be considered a standard for future work.

%X Background Akershus University Hospital is the largest acute care hospital in Norway. It employs 6.200 people to serve 460.000 inhabitants, of which 115.000 are children. Currently, our Department is experiencing an increased admission of critically ill children, which let physicians and nurses feel overwhelmed and insecure. Our project aimed to improve knowledge, communication and documentation to meet today's standards for quality of care. Methods Based on the Acute-Life-Threatening-Events-Recognition- Treatment (ALERTTM) courses, the Airway-Breathing- Circulation-Disability-Exposure (ABCDE) algorithm, and the Identify-Situation-B/////////ackground-Assessment-Recommendation (ISBAR) tool, we have developed an interactive platform for physician and nurses to improve clinical communication and to standardize assessment for intensive care patients. Furthermore, we have introduced the Brigthon Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) to detect children with the highest risk for cardio-respiratory failure. Results Our healthcare providers have benefited from this program. For example, they gained useful skills to create efficient work flows and improve team communication. For half an hour every other week, we play a scenario where 2 physicians and 2 nurses practice the ABCDE algorithm, ISBAR tool and the PEWS in a simulated patient. We have implemented training courses (Casetrening) to help them use the various assessment tools. Our main focus is to provide high quality of care, patient safety and efficient clinical operations. However, we understand that it takes an ongoing effort to introduce a systematic method in practice. Conclusion We have introduced a program for physicians and nurses to increase clinical competence and patient care with a high potential for further development.

%X Description: Nursing plays a crucial role in the improvement of end-oflife care. In an academic medical center effort must be made to prepare nursing staff to care for a diverse patient population, high acuity, psychosocial factors, intense family dynamics and the emotional response to death. It is an important part of nursing wellness and resilience to anticipate personal reactions and develop appropriate coping mechanisms when providing end-of-life care. This dynamic requires an innovative educational plan which addresses the intensity of the patient population as well as the organizational and nursing culture. Many challenges exist to ensure that dying individuals receive competent and compassionate care as they face the end-of-life. To meet these challenges, we have developed a teaching program to support the nursing staff in obtaining these skills. The initial group consisted of fifty registered nurses from one medical surgical unit. This nursing unit cares for the general inpatient hospice patients and has the highest number of end-oflife ''comfort care'' patients in the organization. The instructional model for end-of-life education starts with pre-education Health stream learning modules on palliative medicine, pain management, symptom management and end-of-life care. These foundational computer modules then continue into an engaging didactic classroom setting which further expands on these concepts. Additionally, self-care was introduced as a topic. In the last phase, the learners progressed to an interprofessional standard patient and family simulation training consisting of APPs, MDs, SW, chaplains, and nursing staff who were able to teach and share their experiences and expertise. Topics included communication, medication equivalency, and safety, ethics, pain and symptom management. The standard patient and family simulated case scenarios brought up memories and emotions for the trainees, who were overwhelmed at times by the remembrances of both peaceful and difficult deaths. The participants provided both articulate and extensive dialogue about their experiences and interactions with members of the team. The nurses had the opportunity to debrief and discuss their anxiety, fears and the witnessed pain and suffering of dying patients. Nurses recognized the cues sent and received between the nurse the standard simulated patient and family. In the post-survey nurses showed increased knowledge with this multitiered educational program. The surveys strongly suggested continued use of open discussion and standard patient simulation in further education. Incorporating this basic end-of-life course is just the beginning to improving care for they dying. This course will help to prepare nurses at all levels to be change agents within the prevailing health care culture. There were many nurses from this initial course who showed interest in becoming end-of-life champions. Teaching in this manner breaks down barriers and allows for a safe environment for learning as well as a culture of openness, curiosity, and commitment to evidence-based care for patients at the end of life.

%X Methods for the dissemination, understanding and implementation of clinical guidelines need to be examined for their effectiveness to help doctors integrate guidelines into practice. The objective of this randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive online Diabetes Needs Assessment Tool (DNAT) (which constructs an e-learning curriculum based on individually identified knowledge gaps), compared with self-directed e-learning of diabetes guidelines. Health professionals were randomised to a 4-month learning period and either given access to diabetes learning modules alone (control group) or DNAT plus learning modules (intervention group). Participants completed knowledge tests before and after learning (primary outcome), and surveys to assess the acceptability of the learning and changes to clinical practice (secondary outcomes). Sixty four percent (677/1054) of participants completed both knowledge tests. The proportion of nurses (5.4%) was too small for meaningful analysis so they were excluded. For the 650 doctors completing both tests, mean (SD) knowledge scores increased from 47.4% (12.6) to 66.8% (11.5) [intervention group (n = 321, 64%)] and 47.3% (12.9) to 67.8% (10.8) [control group (n = 329, 66%)], (ANCOVA p = 0.186). Both groups were satisfied with the usability and usefulness of the learning materials. Seventy seven percent (218/284) of the intervention group reported combining the DNAT with the recommended reading materials was "very useful"/"useful". The majority in both groups (184/287, 64.1% intervention group and 206/299, 68.9% control group) [95% CI for the difference (-2.8 to 12.4)] reported integrating the learning into their clinical practice. Both groups experienced a similar and significant improvement in knowledge. The learning materials were acceptable and participants incorporated the acquired knowledge into practice.

%X The virtual reality coronary angiography simulator "CATHI" (Catheter Instruction System, Mannheim, Germany) simulates coronary arteries with implemented vessel lesions in virtual patients. Like similar systems the software model runs on common PC systems, which are linked to the mechanical device for manual training. We combined the advantages of this skill trainer with the near to reality assembly of a cardiac catheterization laboratory (Cath-lab) by connecting it to a full scale simulator (HPS, METI, Sarasota, FL). We present two methods of synchronizing the heartbeat between both simulation devices. Method A-the hardware solution- uses the electrocardiogram- synchronization signal of the HPS as a pacemaker for CATHI's heartbeat. Method B, a more sophisticated software solution, uses a communication protocol between the HPS software and the CATHI system to realize bi-directional data exchange. In 14 identical courses we performed four different scenarios using the above described setup, all of which had to be undergone by the 143 participants (including nursing staff, experienced- and inexperienced cardiologists). The synchronization of the two systems contributed to a close to reality situation. Scenario control was accomplished via commercially available HPS-software. Tachycardic and bradycardic arrhythmias were predetermined by predefined scenarios of the HPS-software, the trainee's intervention resulting in realistic treatment outcomes. Using either method, the transmitted signals resulted in the same heartbeat in the CATHI-system, making the cardiologic interventions more difficult but more realistic. © 2008 Society for Simulation in Healthcare.

%X Human patient simulation in nursing education has become an accepted and expected form of pedagogy. Research on the use of human patient simulation to evaluate student performance, however, is still at an early stage. The vast majority of these sources report the unit of analysis as the nurse-patient dyad (one nurse-one patient) situated in an infrequently occurring, high-risk, or costly event such as a code blue, and the literature reveals little evidence on the efficacy of the use of simulation for the care of multiple patients. The teaching innovation, discussed herein, involving a simulation, used a leadership scenario of a routine day in an acute-care hospital unit. The aim of the project was to provide a high-fidelity simulation of the competing demands on a nurse's time and attention while caring for multiple patients. Working as a team, using principles of prioritization, delegation, scope of practice, and communication, senior baccalaureate nursing students assumed the various roles of interdisciplinary team members as they moved through staged sequences of changing patient and unit conditions. This was followed by debriefing session that prompted the students to identify their errors in judgment, including sending the wrong patient to the operating room, failing to rescue a patient, and failing to delegate critical tasks to other nursing team members.

%X Topic Significance & Study Purpose/Background/Rationale: Improvements in transfusion medicine, blood typing, and donor screening have reduced the likelihood of a reaction from administration of blood products. In an effort to prevent transfusion reactions, our current standard is to administer acetaminophen 650mg and diphenhydramine 25mg, 30 minutes before transfusions. This practice may unnecessarily place patients at increased risk for complications including falls, cognitive impairment, and hepatic toxicity. Methods, Intervention, & Analysis: P=Adult BMT/oncology patient; I=Does the prophylactic use of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine; C=versus no premedication; O=affect the incidence of blood transfusion reactions? The evidence based practice committee (EBPC) at a comprehensive cancer center in the Midwest conducted a literature review to determine if evidence supported the efficacy for reducing transfusion reactions with routine premedication utilizing acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. The search strategy included electronic searches of numerous resources including PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Medline, Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO), Ovid, and Scopus to gather established information. Findings & Interpretation: The results of one prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and two retrospective reviews were analyzed and failed to show any benefit to premedication prior to transfusion of blood products. Based on the evidence, the EBPC sought to obtain a baseline rate of transfusion reaction at their facility. Between January and April 2014, a retrospective review was conducted on 137 transfusion patients to determine the frequency of transfusion-related reactions. Four transfusion reactions were reported; all four patients had been premedicated prior to transfusion. Six patients did not receive any premedication; none of which had a transfusion-related reaction. Discussion & Implications: The chair of the EBPC presented these findings at BMTQI. Committee concerns included the possible increase in confounding febrile reactions that might lead to unnecessary admissions and febrile transfusion reaction work-ups. A compromise was reached with the BMTQI committee approving the elimination of Benadryl as a routine premedication. Next steps will include implementation of this new protocol with additional data collection on rate of transfusion reactions for the next three months. If results concur with reviewed evidence, this protocol change will be expanded across the facility and can be a platform for other centers who are still using premedication.

%X Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies. We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET's content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues. Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students' attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013. In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends. The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors).

%X Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a national epidemic. Excellent treatment algorithms and medications exist, yet the ability to achieve SEMDSA-specified glycaemic targets remains poor for a number of reasons, including heavy reliance on self-care, inappropriate systems, patient and doctor barriers to insulin initiation, and intensification and the requirement for data-driven therapy modification. Method: Four hundred and eighty insulinised type 2 diabetes mellitus patients volunteered to participate. After an initial structured faceto- face education session with a Doctor of Nursing Education (DNE), ongoing data-driven instruction on dose titration to reach SEMDSAdefined glycaemic targets and coaching on meal planning, exercise and insulin use were carried out via DNEs in a call centre operating on the Guidepost® software platform. Patients submitted structured self-monitoring of glucose readings to the platform via SMS. The frequency of structured testing and clinical interactions varied per patient. Results: The overall uptake and acceptability of the programme was high, with over 26 000 glucose readings submitted. Patient and doctor feedback was positive, with 88% retention over 18 weeks. Target range pre-meal blood glucose values between 4 and 7 mmol/l increased 62% from baseline to week 18, and the time spent in the hyperglycaemic (blood glucose > 11 mmol/l) and hypoglycaemic (≤ 3.9 mmol/l) ranges declined by 46% and 25%, respectively. Conclusion: A patient-centered diabetes care and education telemedicine programme in insulin-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, that utilises a combination of structured testing, SMS-based data input, periodic data-driven telephonic coaching and validated learning has a good uptake, is acceptable to patients and healthcare providers, and results in improved glycaemia.

%X Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common among older adults with dementia in long-term care (LTC) settings. Nonpharmacological interventions are safe and effective treatments for NPS although LTC staff have limited time to implement these activities. The use of volunteers may be one to increase utilization of these strategies in LTC. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of nonpharmacological interventions for NPS in LTC and designed a training program for volunteers to implement these strategies with older adults in a LTC home in Kingston. Volunteers were recruited using social media, online and print advertisements and trained in the Volunteers Adding Life in Dementia (VALID) program. Results: A total of 10 community volunteers were recruited and completed the VALID orientation and training in the first phase of the pilot study. Ten older adults with dementia and NPS were enrolled from LTC. Each LTC resident with dementia was provided with up to 3 - 30 minute visits per week and each volunteer provided 3 hours weekly as part of the VALID program. Initial results from the first 10 patients enrolled in the program suggest that the program has been beneficial for volunteers, older adults with dementia, and LTC nursing staff. Conclusion: The VALID program is a novel approach to providing enjoying activities for older adults with NPS in LTC. This program appears to be feasible and enjoyed by older adults with dementia and volunteers. The effect of the VALID program on NPS symptoms, nursing stress and volunteers will continue to be evaluated in this pilot project.

%X The Hampton University School of Nursing has implemented a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Distance Education Program that utilizes the Blackboard Learning System, which was designed to transform the Internet into a powerful environment for the educational experience. The Interne, however, may be a new learning environment for many nurses seeking a graduate degree. The Blackboard platform allows for synchronous, real-time activities such as chat rooms, and asynchronous, delayed, activities such as discussion boards and digital drop boxes that can be used for student-to-instructor and instructor-to-student document transfer. This article focuses on the skills and challenges of navigating a course on the Internet using Blackboard. Recommendations for improving the teaching-learning process using a Web-based environment are included.

%X Background-Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors. Methods-To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse-delivered, telephone-based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web-based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse-delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in-person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone-based, nurse-administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence-based therapies and improvement in health behaviors. Conclusion-If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web-based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

%X Objective: To examine the instructional effectiveness of a course for nurses wishing to learn flexible cystoscopy, using a virtual reality flexible cystoscopy simulator to measure the outcome. Subjects and methods: Fourteen urology nurse practitioners with no previous experience of cystoscopy were taught the basic techniques of flexible cystoscopy. They then had supervised group instruction during which they practised flexible cystoscopy on an inanimate latex model, and were taught how to handle the cystoscope, followed by unsupervised practice, including use of the virtual reality (VR) simulator (URO Mentor, Simbionix, Israel). They then undertook a cystoscopy task on the simulator: within the bladder there were 10 flags (numbered 1-10) at key positions. By visualizing and photographing each of the flags the subject would have visualized the entire bladder mucosa. The number of flags seen was thus used as a measure of how much of the bladder mucosa was examined. The VR simulator also measured the total procedure time. After a day of training the subjects were reassessed and the changes in performance evaluated. Subjects were also asked their opinion of the use of VR for flexible cystoscopy. Results: The median (range) time to complete the procedure before the course was 3.33 (2-5.5) min and the number of flags seen 7 (6-9). After the course, the median time decreased to 2.85 (1.5-4.42) min and the number of flags seen increased to 8 (6-9). The change in time was significant (P = 0.03) but the difference in the number of flags was not (P = 0.12). All 14 subjects enjoyed the use of VR for learning flexible cystoscopy: they all reported that they were more confident in handling a flexible cystoscope and in undertaking flexible cystoscopy. Conclusion: The virtual reality simulator was an effecctive tool for teaching flexible cystoscopy.

%X Objective: Data regarding health providers' personal lifestyle and the differential effect of a short-term personal lifestyle experience intervention program on health providers are limited. Methods: We conducted a controlled study aimed at changing personal attitudes toward lifestyle habits among 323 health professionals: 136 (42%) physicians, 140 (43%) dietitians, and 47 (15%) nurses and health promoters. In the intervention group (n = 209) individuals participated in a 2-d intensive self-experience workshop in an isolated location emphasizing healthy lifestyle and behavior-modifying techniques. Intervention and control groups were followed for 6 mo. Results: At baseline, avoidance of salt, trans-fatty acids, saturated fats, and processed meat was more frequent among dietitians (P < 0.05 versus physicians). The physicians reported a lower intake of olive/canola oil, nuts/almonds, dietary fibers, vegetables, and fruits (P < 0.05). Furthermore, physicians reported lower confidence in lifestyle primary prevention and felt less useful engaging in health-promotion activities (P < 0.05 versus other health professionals). After 6 mo, waist circumference decreased in the intervention group (-1.3 versus +1.8 cm in control group, P < 0.01). The effect was more prominent among physicians. A modest differential effect of the intervention program was shown in health-promotion activities. Conclusion: Approaches toward primary prevention can be improved by an intervention program focusing on personal changes of health care providers. Physicians who are less likely to personally adhere to and believe in lifestyle primary prevention are more likely to benefit from this platform. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

%X What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? A competent urologist should not only have effective technical skills, but also other attributes that would make him/her a complete surgeon. These include team-working, communication and decision-making skills. Although evidence for effectiveness of simulation exists for individual simulators, there is a paucity of evidence for utility and effectiveness of these simulators in training programmes that aims to combine technical and non-technical skills training. This article explains the process of development and validation of a centrally coordinated simulation program (Participants - South-East Region Specialist Registrars) under the umbrella of the British Association for Urological Surgeons (BAUS) and the London Deanery. This program incorporated training of both technical (synthetic, animal and virtual reality models) and non-technical skills (simulated operating theatres). Objectives To establish the feasibility and acceptability of a centralized, simulation-based training-programme. Simulation is increasingly establishing its role in urological training, with two areas that are relevant to urologists: (i) technical skills and (ii) non-technical skills. Materials and Methods For this London Deanery supported pilot Simulation and Technology enhanced Learning Initiative (STeLI) project, we developed a structured multimodal simulation training programme. The programme incorporated: (i) technical skills training using virtual-reality simulators (Uro-mentor and Perc-mentor [Symbionix, Cleveland, OH, USA], Procedicus MIST-Nephrectomy [Mentice, Gothenburg, Sweden] and SEP Robotic simulator [Sim Surgery, Oslo, Norway]); bench-top models (synthetic models for cystocopy, transurethral resection of the prostate, transurethral resection of bladder tumour, ureteroscopy); and a European (Aalborg, Denmark) wet-lab training facility; as well as (ii) non-technical skills/crisis resource management (CRM), using SimMan (Laerdal Medical Ltd, Orpington, UK) to teach team-working, decision-making and communication skills. The feasibility, acceptability and construct validity of these training modules were assessed using validated questionnaires, as well as global and procedure/task-specific rating scales. Results In total 33, three specialist registrars of different grades and five urological nurses participated in the present study. Construct-validity between junior and senior trainees was significant. Of the participants, 90% rated the training models as being realistic and easy to use. In total 95% of the participants recommended the use of simulation during surgical training, 95% approved the format of the teaching by the faculty and 90% rated the sessions as well organized. A significant number of trainees (60%) would like to have easy access to a simulation facility to allow more practice and enhancement of their skills. Conclusions A centralized simulation programme that provides training in both technical and non-technical skills is feasible. It is expected to improve the performance of future surgeons in a simulated environment and thus improve patient safety. © 2012 BJU International.

%X Objective: India an overview: (ISBMR / IOF The Asian audit Report : 2009). Increased life expectancy to 66 yrs. First DXA machine installed in 1997. Vit D Deficiency. make us prone to OP .( skin pigmentation, clothing habits & absence of vitamin D fortified foods). BMD normgrams are in the final stages of development. DXA testing is confined to mostly urban areas. No waiting usually. But poor standardization, inaccurate technique & variations in reporting needs to be addressed systematically on a national scale. Most drugs are available in generic & branded forms. general awareness is below optimal. Models of Care: Multiple step and pronged approach has been designed and adapted in a few multi specialty Tertiary care hospitals in Bangalore (South India). The steps include but are not limited to the following: Screening: Identifing patients at risk using the 1 min IOF questionnaire and a peripheral Bone density testing (forearm as a part of Routine health check packages in individuals over 45 years (women) and 50 years men) with a risk factor. Case finding: If the findings show a low BMD at forearm, or and in patients who are at risk per 1-min IOF questionnaire or if there is any other clinical reason to test further then they are subjected to a complete bone density evaluation. Other Indications for BMD testing (ISCD Official Position 2007) which include the following: Women aged 65 and older Postmenopausal women under age 65 with risk factors for fracture. Women during the menopausal transition with clinical risk factors for fracture, such as low body weight, prior fracture, or high-risk medication use. Men aged 70 and older. Men under age 70 with clinical risk factors for fracture. Adults with a fragility fracture. Adults with a disease or condition associated with low bone mass or bone loss. Adults taking medications asso- ciated with low bone mass or bone loss. Anyone being considered for pharmacologic therapy. Anyone being treated, to monitor treatment effect. Anyone not receiving therapy in whom evidence of bone loss would lead to treatment. Women discontinuing estrogen should be considered for bone density testing according to the indications listed above. All BMD reports are read by a trained radiologist/nuclear medicine physician eliminating any artifacts and technical errors. If abnormal or osteoporotic or risk estimation using Frax & Encore (GE). Patients with Fx Risk >3 % at hip & 20 % at any major site are referred through the Osteoporosis Clinic. Fig 1. : Clinical pathway to screen, diagnose and manage osteoporosis. Osteoporosis clinic are centers structured to triage efficiently the management and treatment strategy on a given patient and work in the pattern of matrix optimizing the quality of care a patient with osteoporosis needs at multiple levels as follows: Acute care: Specialties like Orthopedics, OBGYN, Emergency Room, Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic Surgery, who see Patients with acute fractures, hip replacements (pre op work up) get a consult or referral to Osteoporosis Clinic. Chronic care: Specialties like Radiologists, Rheumatologists, OBGYN, Geriatrics who see patients with vertebral fractures, low back pain etc. also refer the patients to the Osteoporosis Clinic at some point of time in their management. Subspecialty referral system: All women in the perimenopausal age group get referred to a OBGYN. If the Z Material and Methods: Awareness Building Activities : Public health approach: emphasizes nutrition, exercise & sunlight exposure beginning childhood so as to achive a better peak mass via multiple newsletters & educational brouchures, media coverage (TV appearances, radio talk shows, guest speaker at various events). Clinical based approach: through programs of awareness, education and training, advocacy and Research to Fight Osteoporosis campaigning “Break Barriers not Bones”. - Series of CME Seminars for consultant physicians (orthopaedic surgeons, gynaecologists endocrinologists), registrars, junior doctors & nurses. - Multiple Screening Camps, “Osteoporosis Symposium”, Bangal re -2008. - Quarterly Bangalore Bone Club Meet - - Multispeciality panel discussions, IOF Certification Courses, Nationwide Webcast Hosting, etc. score is low, or secondary osteoporosis is suspected they get referred to a pediatrics or Endocrinologist.

%X Aims and objectives: Due to dietary habits of high spice content and simultaneous use of tobacco/alcohol, there is high incidence of colorectal cancer at young age in Asian populations. GI cancer most common malignancy in rural India. Since no scientifically observed data available till now, our 10 year old cancer NGO initiated this population based study in rural/tribal India. We aimed to collect data on this issue and correlate incidence of GI cancer with age. Methods: The colorectal database was searched for all cancer patients from civil and rural cottage hospitals in three districts covering 24 villages from 2001 to 2009. Patients selected were below the age of 45 years who underwent a either chemo or surgery/ radiation therapy in city specialized hospitals 7 returned to native villages for palliative care, follow-up. Our NGO volunteers collected this data prospectively for demographics, tumor stage, type of therapy received, morbidity and mortality. Results: incidence of colorectal cancer is 82% among all cancer cases. 63% males 37% females. Age group of 35-45 most vulnerable. 27% patients underwent curative colorectal resection, 38% has received chemotherapy with surgery/radiation for cancer. Shockingly a very high percentage of patients [71%] discontinued cancer therapy midway due to high unaffordable cost and poor access to drugs in rural India. Out of these 81% patients also mentioned inadequate patient education as major factor towards development of depression/low-QOL. commonest sites for cancer were rectum and sigmoid colon. 41% has metastasis. In last four years mortality rate is 64%. Conclusion: Colorectal cancer in young patients is very high. Dietary, cultural habits increase incidence. Poor access to newer chemotherapeutic techniques/drugs is most sensitive issues. Lack of qualified oncologists and nurses for palliative care increase mortality rates. Our Indian cancer NGO has taken initiative on this front by forming education module for nurses and rural physicians. Our project has been awaiting guidance/funding from government agencies for implementation to serve poor rural/ tribal populations. Recommendations: Our approach is very practical for developing Asian/African nations. We need a strong platform like 12th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer, Barcelona to show our work to researchers/activists from developed world. Our project structure and its functioning will be shown graphically at Barcelona congress. WHO/ESMO need to formulate policy on this burning-issue at Satellite sessions. ESMO like organizations must propagate specific recommendations/policies to provide subsidized chemo drugs in developing nations to overcome these barriers. Economics of Cancer-therapeutics must be high on agenda of such specialized and focused cancer-conference of ESMO.

%X Background: Patient Advocacy Issue : Trained nursing care for lung cancer sufferers is a dream by patients community. Trained nursing care facilities available only in few city hospitals in India. Especially cancer sufferers who return to villages in rural parts of India after taking chemotherapy/ surgery in city hospitals need this assistance. NGO's can play key role in providing Trained nursing care . Current status: Very little nursing research has been conducted within lung cancer patients in Asia. Even national cancer registry doenot provide scientific information on this crucial issue. Oncologists need to propose increase research activity of nurse specialists working with patients with lung cancer. Here module of training must be devised suitable to Asian hospital care setup. Due to lack of resources for Training nurses, this issue has been neglected. Methods: Our Indian cancer NGO palliative care team plans to mobilize training resources from local Health-centers. In phase I of our project 6 tertiary care hospitals and two NGOs will be included. Primary Training imparted to nurses by Tamexperts invited from city hospitals. This Team will have social worker & nurse trainer & oncologists. Local traditional faith-healers & community leaders involved for more community acceptance/ participation. Aim to provide physical-comfort to patient, improve relationship with family members for terminal lung cancer disease Results: Our NGO proposed plan will present our findings/need & ways to overcome obstacles in providing nursing care. Survey questionnaire will be sent to Team members asking them to identify important areas for nursing research in lung cancer care. Trainee nurses will be asked to suggest possible research. The findings of this survey will be presented. Plan about findings may be used to generate nursing research studies will also be discussed. We present our NGO's proposed Nursing-Training-Module [NTM] project finding in printed chart-format at WCLC-2011 conference, Amsterdam. We need strong platform like IASLC-2011-conference to show our findings to researchers/activists from developed world and get their guidance on this difficult issue. Government hospitals in collaboration with NGO-clinics must carry out supportive-care-programmes with NGOcounselors to bring down incidence of frailty/ depression in thoracic cancer patients. Conclusion: Our Indian cancer NGO has taken initiative on this front by forming education module for nurses and rural physicians. Our project has been awaiting further guidance/funding for implementation to serve poor rural/tribal geriatric lung cancer populations If resources like fellowship/ training-grants are made available to oncology nurses, then NGO's can perform good job of providing economical home based nursing care for Lung & other cancer sufferers in remote areas of India.

%X INTRODUCTION: Crisis management is acknowledged as key to ensuring patient safety in operating room (OR) practice. Interprofessional education aims to teach different professions how to work effectively together. In interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE), debriefing can be challenging, as participants may feel shy and intimidated about reflecting upon their performance in front of peers from other professions. This study aims to evaluate IPSE crisis resource management training according to the Kirkpatrick model. METHODS: Teams consisting of one anesthesia resident/fellow, one surgical resident/fellow and one circulating OR nurse, underwent 2 different simulated scenarios with one video-assisted, expert instructor-lead team debriefing in between. The crisis scenarios used a hybrid simulation, combining a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer and a high-fidelity computer enhanced mannikin in a realistic operating room environment. Immediately after the session participants evaluated the program using an anonymous questionnaire, rating their experience. The questionnaire approached level 1 (Learners' views on the learning experience) and 2a (modification of attitudes and perceptions) according to the modified Kirkpatrick model. RESULTS: Eighteen teams (54 individuals) each participated in two scenarios and one expert instructor-lead debriefing for a total of 36 scenarios and 18 debriefings. All participants, but one nurse, evaluated the training session. CONCLUSIONS: IPSE for peroperative crisis resource management training was feasible and very well received by the 3 professions. Expert instructor-lead team debriefing didn't appear to be a barrier to the implementation of routine IPSE crisis resource management training. Further studies should investigate the impact of such programs on higher Kirkpatrick levels.

%X Quality in health care services is neither a simple nor an apolitical issue. Quality is a complex concept and how it is defined and measured has important consequences for services. The definition and measurement of service quality in health care has slipped from professional toward managerial control. Professionals such as nurses have an absolute concept of quality which is a part of their value system and based upon their training and experience. Managerial concepts of quality may be influenced by other organizational concerns such as the pursuit of efficiency. This paper outlines quality assurance systems in mental health nursing and the wider quality debate and argues that there may well be a trade-off between quality of service and efficiency. The moves toward outcome measures and performance indicators are also discussed and the argument forwarded that such a focus serves to exclude users and cloaks serious issues in service delivery. The argument of this paper is that evaluation of service quality needs to include users, and this could provide them with a platform for enhanced involvement in service planning.

%X Aims To develop and pilot a reproducible curriculum for nurses with limited or no sexual and reproductive health care (SRH) experience to become competent dual-trained practitioners. The model used supernumerary training posts and clinical training and assessment adapted from that used to train doctors for the Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare in the UK. Background There is currently no standard SRH nurse training in the UK. Nurses undertake various university-based qualifications supported by clinical sessions, and employers can be reluctant to sponsor these because of the cost and the time required. Methods Two nurses were employed on a 6-month programme consisting of five parts: (1) the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) e-learning programme, in conjunction with e-Learning for Healthcare; (2) the FSRH 'Course of 5'; (3) structured clinical training; (4) visits to other relevant services; and (5) clinical supervision and mentoring. Assessment was by a portfolio of evidence; signed competences; reflections from clinical sessions; and outcomes of visits to services. The project was evaluated by means of questionnaires and interviews with trainees and staff. Conclusions The project demonstrated that by using a model similar to that used for basic SRH medical training it is possible to train nurses in core holistic SRH care within the workplace. Many SRH services are reporting severe difficulties in the recruitment of nurses trained in SRH, and this practice-based training would allow services and providers to invest in training to build up the workforce they require.

%X Objective: The project aimed to develop and pilot a curriculum for nurse training based on the model used to train doctors in the UK for the Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (DFSRH). This covers routine contraception, early pregnancy assessment and referral, and STI diagnosis and management in men and women. There is currently no standardised SRH nurse training in the UK and nurses undertake a university- based qualification supported by clinical sessions which employers are reluctant to sponsor because of the cost and time required. Many SRH services are reporting severe difficulties in the recruitment of nurses trained in SRH. The project aimed to demonstrate that services can employ nurses with limited SRH skills in supernumerary 'training posts'and support them to gain the required skills to work independently providing Level 1 holistic SRH care. Design and methods: The curriculum was agreed, and a programme of visits and clinical placements planned. Two nurses with limited sexual health experience were employed into a six-month training post at the Margaret Pyke and Mortimer Market Centres in London, which together are one of the largest providers of SRH services in the UK. Each nurse was allocated two Nurse Specialists as clinical assessors, one for Genito-Urinary Medicine and one for Contraception competences. In addition, a Nurse Specialist acted as a mentor for the theoretical part of the programme and as an external reviewer for progress and evaluation of the project. A steering group of nurses and doctors oversaw the project. The training programme consisted of five parts; (i) The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) e-learning programme, eSRH; (ii) The FSRH course of Five; (iii) Structured clinical training; (iv) Visits to other relevant services; and (v) Clinical supervision and mentoring. Assessment was by a portfolio of evidence demonstrating; successful completion of the e-learning and course of five; signed competences; reflections from clinical sessions and objectives and outcomes of visits to services. Results: Both nurses successfully completed the programme within the six-month time frame and impressed colleagues with their competence and confidence as valuable members of the SRH team. The programme was highly evaluated and both have been employed within the service as integrated SRH nurses. Conclusions: The project showed that in using a model similar to that used for SRH medical training it is possible to train nurses in holistic SRH care within the workplace.

%X The aim of this study was to describe registered nurses' experiences with an e-learning education program (ELEP) conducted at a 776-bed teaching medical center in Taipei. The study was completed in three stages: planning, implementation, and evaluation. Nurses who were registered were randomly assigned either to the ELEP or traditional in-classroom program (TICP). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Forty-two nurses participated (22 in the ELEP and 20 in the TICP). Scores for participants were all > 70 points (out of 100) for both programs. Of the five courses, only teaching and learning and communication showed significant statistical difference between the two groups (p = .001). Nearly all participants (97.6%) felt satisfied with their program (both ELEP and TICP). All nurses passed the nursing care skill tests. Findings should help guide efforts to popularize e-learning education in Taiwan and help create alternative learning methods for future continuing nursing education programs.

%X Background: Final body management is a complex process requiring coordination among hospital departments, medical examiner (ME), funeral home, gift of life (GoL), and legal next-of-kin (NoK). Commonly a paper form documents and tracks body management, and was supplemented by a Microsoft ® Access database. However, limitations included entry duplication, illegible information, lack of instant verification, and no real-time updates or archival verification of body status. Design: A web based e-BDF application was created by our Application Development Technology Team (ADTT), with collaboration by pathology, nursing, GoL, security, and ME. It was written in C# on the .NET 2.0 platform, with data stored on a Microsoft ® SQL server. Users were assigned various designations. Application entry includes; death notifications, body delivery status/pick-up, autopsy status, and archived information. The e-BDF is initiated by entering the deceased MRN by a registered nurse (RN), under death notification. The e-BDF is divided into six tabs documenting patient personal information, legal NoK, autopsy, GoL, ME, and final checklist. Each tab offers guidance with real time help plus phone contact. An autopsy request requires a physician to discuss/obtain permission from the legal NoK, and document the reason. A preliminary e-BDF can be generated, facilitating body transport to the morgue. Later, a completed form is printed with signatures, by RN, physician, and NoK. The record is locked and archived with a history log. Each subsequent step is also documented, including morgue delivery, autopsy completion, and release by security. A hospital-wide training and annual recertification is required for users. Results: The system has been in place for one year with the following benefits: eliminates paper forms, data entry duplication, and multiple hands off, reduction in data entry time by 50%, single system archiving, expedites GoL, ME, and funeral home processing, and 24/7 real-time access and updates. Furthermore, incomplete forms and error rates have almost become non-existent. Conclusions: The e-BDF web-based application has significantly improved work flow with enhanced patient service, safety, and security. Furthermore, interdepartmental communication is improved with increased compliance to hospital policies for autopsy request and correct documentation of NoK. We continue to monitor and update the system as feedback is received.

%X An Electronic Body Management Form (e-BDF) was created in 2010 to deal with complex end-of-life issues. Our prior paper form supplemented by a Microsoft Access database tracking system had several drawbacks including incompleteness, erroneous forms, time delays, and lack of real-time updates. Our experience relates to autopsy requests, data entry, and clinician education. e-BDF was developed by our Information Technology Team with input from pathology and clinical entities. e-BDF is written in C# on the .NET 2.0 platform with data stored on a Microsoft® SQL server. The form is initiated by the nurse, and includes six tabs; patient information, legal next-of-kin (NoK), autopsy, Gift of Life (GoL), Medical Examiner (ME), and final checklist. Each tab offers step-by-step guidance with real time help. A physician request, NoK permission, and reason for autopsy are mandatory. Once the completed form is signed by nurse, physician, and NoK, the record is locked and archived. Each subsequent step including morgue delivery, autopsy completion, and security release is tracked. Hospital-wide training and annual recertification is implemented. Our autopsy rate has dropped from 64 in 2010 to 35 and 33, in 2011 and 2012 respectively. This decline is attributed to proper case evaluation for ME and valid indications for an autopsy request. We anticipate an increase in autopsy numbers as physicians are mandated to discuss the need for autopsy with families. Our nursing staff, annually surveyed, have endorsed e-BDF as it eliminates data duplication, multiple hand-offs, and redundant archiving, while providing real time information to expedite GoL, ME, and funeral home processing. Furthermore, the final checklist halts the process if information is missing, negating incomplete forms. The e-BDF also facilitates real-time guidance for clinicians. Meanwhile, our collaboration with nursing, GoL, ME, hospital security, and funeral homes has significantly improved patient service, safety, and security.

%X Background: In NHSBT Blood Donation, the reduction of donor adverse events is a key strategic target. Since 2008, under new clinical leadership, BD Nursing has developed a strategy to achieve this target and taken ownership for improving the safety and overall experience of blood donors. Aims: It has been an exciting and challenging journey to lead our registered nurses away from a task-orientated operational role to achieve the vision of nurses as advocates for donors, fully accountable for their safety and dignified care. The first strategic step was to create a new nursing management line, quite distinct from the operational function. In order to communicate the vision with the 350 nurses who work at our blood donation venues, the new nurse leadership team hosted several Development Days. At these interactive events, nurses were encouraged to re-engage with their professional code and recognise the need for a change in their role in order to maximise nurses' contribution to the donation experience and use their professional knowledge to benefit donors and the organisation. Methods: The need for reporting nurse sensitive outcomes led to the development of an automated nursing dashboard, providing a level of detail which was previously unknown. This new reporting tool made it possible to implement a robust and challenging performance management framework with clear measures of success. The number of faints, bruises, re-bleeds, deferrals by category and nurse sensitive complaints are now made visible on heat maps and nurses themselves are able to identify and investigate trends, escalating concerns for problem-solving and best practice for sharing. Results: All nurses have participated in the first of a series of e-learning study modules, covering basic physiology, building to evidence based adverse event prevention and good management. A detailed donation pathway, “Points of Care”, which describes adverse event prevention strategies and compassionate care for vulnerable donors, has been implemented and nurses now actively participate at team planning meetings to ensure that sessions are planned to deliver the Points of Care recommendations and that safety concerns are addressed before the session takes place. Cultural change in BD nursing is evidenced by these examples of nurse-led initiatives. - In the last year, 38 nurses have been trained in-house as Clinical Audit Champions and over 100 as Dignity Champions and they will play a key role in embedding the donor care standards and measuring effectiveness. - A new post-donation arm dressing protocol has been implemented resulting in a two thirds reduction in re-bleeds. - Pre-session education of vulnerable donors to prepare them for giving blood is in progress. - BD nurses have provided a cost-effective flu vaccination programme for staff across the whole of NHSBT for the last 2 years. Summary: There are fewer nurses in the directorate now than there were in 2008 but their impact is greater as a result of them taking responsibility for the high quality care they were trained to deliver. Nurses are now doing the right thing.

%X Program/Project Purpose: While global health placements are recognized to be a rich learning experience for students while they are on placement, there is also a rich learning experience to be had upon their return. Additionally, global health placements often generate ethical, social and emotional challenges for students upon their return. The importance of pre-departure training has been recognized, however the importance of supporting students upon their return from global health experiences has received little attention, despite the challenges faced by students. Re-integration learning and challenges may be enhanced through academic supervision and support. Aim: To share experiences with the introduction of re-entry workshops (REW) for students in healthcare disciplines. Structure/Method/Design: Students within a Global Health Studies (GHS) concentration of a MSc. in nursing program work with vulnerable populations, both at home and abroad, These students were offered REW in addition to the usual pre-departure workshop and ongoing support while on placement. Participating students spent 3.5 months in a global health partnership site (Africa, SE-Asia, Caribbean, South America, and Canadian aboriginal community), completing both clinical and research components. The REW consisted of one session/month for three months. Each session lasted 3 hours and was facilitated by graduates of the GHS concentration. Outcomes & Evaluation: The REW highlighted many challenges that students experienced in their return home. The sessions offered an opportunity for students to share positive aspects of their experience as well as many challenges experienced while on placement and since their return, in a respectful, non-judgmental environment. Prominent themes include: Disillusionment with humanitarian work Difficult transition when returning to structured life of school in Canada Challenge of being the “GHS” students, difficulty re-integrating in peer groups within classroom setting The ever-present concern about entering the workforce after graduation Social media, and the impacts (both positive and negative) of maintaining contact with friends and colleagues from GHS placement Lobster analogy to help conceptualize feelings of vulnerability when returning to Canada (Growing a new shell ie. Integrating their new experience, they remain vulnerable until the new shell hardens) Pressure of wearing the “University hat”, representing not only the university, but also Canada Importance of re-integrating coping mechanisms when returning from placement, ex. extra-curricular activities, physical activity, entertainment Risk of PTSD, signs and symptoms, and where to seek assistance Through the experience of facilitating these re-entry workshops several strategies were noted as supporting students: meeting together as a group functioned as a support network normalizing and sharing personal experiences alleviated some of the emotional challenges Going Forward: Providing re-entry support to students in healthcare disciplines upon their return from global health settings is crucial in encouraging a smoother re-integration and is useful in detecting mental health issues that require intervention/support.

%X Background: An elearning tool: eHIV-STI was developed by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH), the Royal Colleges of Physicians (RCP) and e-Learning for Healthcare. The first sessions went live in February 2010 and the project was completed in December 2011 with 141 sessions. eHIV-STI covers the knowledge component of the UK Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) training curriculum, from introductory to advanced STI and HIV knowledge required for practise as a specialist. It also acts a refresher for established consultants and has been approved by the RCP for external CPD, supporting revalidation. It is available free to all clinical staff in the NHS. Introductory sessions have been embedded in STI training for non specialists, and for GUM trainees, since 2012, sessions are used to complement national specialist courses, delivering some knowledge in advance by allowing the face to face sessions to deal with more complex issues. Methods: Using reports generated within the learning management system we undertook detailed analysis of usage of the tool since its introduction, by clinician type, sessions accessed, and evaluation of sessions, as well as collating more specific feedback from trainees using it as an adjunct to training courses. Results: The number of registered users has risen steadily since 2010 to 10217 individual users accessing sessions 104857 times by the end of 2012. The majority of GUM trainees and consultants are registered users, but additionally it is used extensively across the health service including 2341 nurses, 1122 newly qualified doctors and 1259 general practitioners. Evaluation of the material ranges from 4.3 to 4.6 out of 5 for content, presentation, interactivity, and self assessment. Conclusion: eHIV-STI has rapidly become a very well used and evaluated learning tool for clinicians working in the fields of sexual health and HIV and in allied areas.

Methods: Nurses of the experimental group (n=67) and control group (n=56) attended the training courses for consolidating and developing core competence of psychiatric nurses from June to October, 2013.The Nursing Department of Mental Health Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine cooperated with Department of Nursing Science of University of Turku, Finland to provide the e-learning courses. Nurses of the experimental group attended five-month training courses in addition to regular hospital nursing training. Competency Inventory for Registered Nurse (CIRN) was adopted to evaluate the core competence of nurses before and after training. Results: The differences of the overall score of CIRN and values of factors (except professional development) of the experimental group before and after training were statistically significant (P<0.01). The differences of the overall score of CIRN and values of factors (except clinical nursing and professional development) between the experimental group and control group after training were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: The e-learning based international cooperative training has good effects on developing the core competence of psychiatric nurses and facilitates international cooperation and communication of psychiatric nursing continuing education.

%X OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and test a Partnership Development Process Assessment (PDPA) scale for content and construct validity and internal consistency reliability. This is needed to document and evaluate community health partnership development processes between public health nurses and community-based organizations in Japan. DESIGN: The study was conducted in three phases. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted to generate items for a new scale. Thirty items were generated and reviewed by an expert panel for content validity and item refinement. A national postal survey of public health nurses was conducted to determine the scale's internal structure, evaluate its reliability, and explore its construct and criterion validity. MEASURES: Validity and reliability testing of the PDPA scale using a content validity index and analysis of correlations with an existing scale were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six items were selected and grouped into four factors: activities to share roles to manage community health issues, platform activities to support partnerships, activities to evaluate partnership practices, and activities to share information regarding community health issues. After factor analysis, 23 items were retained. CONCLUSION: The PDPA scale is a valid and reliable instrument for public health nurses to assess partnership development activities.

%X BACKGROUND: The use of simulations has been considered as opportunities for students to enhance their critical thinking (CT), but previous studies were limited because they did not provide in-depth information on the working dynamics of simulation or on the effects of the number of simulation exposures on CT. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of an integrated pediatric nursing simulation used in a nursing practicum on students' CT abilities and identified the effects of differing numbers of simulation exposures on CT in a multi-site environment. DESIGN: The study used a multi-site, pre-test, post-test design. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A total of 237 nursing students at three universities enrolled in a pediatric practicum participated in this study from February to December 2013. METHODS: All three schools used the same simulation courseware, including the same simulation scenarios, evaluation tools, and simulation equipment. The courseware incorporated high-fidelity simulators and standardized patients. Students at school A completed one simulation session, whereas students at schools B and C completed two and three simulation sessions, respectively. Yoon's Critical Thinking Disposition tool (2008) was used to measure students' CT abilities. RESULTS: The gains in students' CT scores varied according to their numbers of exposures to the simulation courseware. With a single exposure, there were no statistically significant gains in CT, whereas three exposures to the courseware produced significant gains in CT. In seven subcategories of critical thinking, three exposures to the simulation courseware produced CT gains in the prudence and intellectual eagerness subcategories, and the overall simulation experience produced CT gains in the prudence, systematicity, healthy skepticism, and intellectual eagerness subcategories. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation courseware may produce positive learning outcomes for prudence in nursing education. In addition, the findings from the multi-site comparative study may contribute to greater understanding of how patient simulation experiences impact students' CT abilities.

%X UNLABELLED: Human patient simulation (HPS) is becoming a popular teaching method in nursing education globally and is believed to enhance both knowledge and critical thinking. OBJECTIVE: While there is evidence that HPS improves knowledge, there is no objective nursing data to support HPS impact on critical thinking. Therefore, we studied knowledge and critical thinking before and after HPS in prelicensure nursing students and attempted to identify the predictors of higher critical thinking scores. METHODS: Using a one-group, quasi-experimental, pre-test post-test design, 154 prelicensure nursing students (age 25.7± 6.7; gender=87.7% female) from 3 schools were studied at the same point in their curriculum using a high-fidelity simulation. Pre- and post-HPS assessments of knowledge, critical thinking, and self-efficacy were done as well as assessments for demographics and learning style. RESULTS: There was a mean improvement in knowledge scores of 6.5 points (P<0.001), showing evidence of learning. However, there was no statistically significant change in the critical thinking scores. A logistic regression with 10 covariates revealed three variables to be predictors of higher critical thinking scores: greater "age" (P=0.01), baseline "knowledge" (P=0.04) and a low self-efficacy score ("not at all confident") in "baseline self-efficacy in managing a patient's fluid levels" (P=.05). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that gains in knowledge with HPS do not equate to changes in critical thinking. It does expose the variables of older age, higher baseline knowledge and low self-efficacy in "managing a patient's fluid levels" as being predictive of higher critical thinking ability. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of repeated or sequential simulations (dosing) and timing after the HPS experience on critical thinking gains.

%X INTRODUCTION: Human patient simulation (HPS) is a widely used method of teaching in nursing education. While it is believed that a student's learning style impacts knowledge gains in HPS, there is little evidence to support this. This study sought to determine the impact of learning style on knowledge gains after a heart failure (HF) simulation experience in pre-licensure nursing students. METHODS: A convenience sample of four cohorts of prelicensure nursing students (n=161) were recruited from three Baccalaureate Schools of Nursing at the same point in their curriculum (age 25.7±6.6 years; gender=85.5% female) and participated in HPS using a HF simulation on a high-fidelity manikin. Learning style was assessed by the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and pre- and post-HPS knowledge measured by parallel, validated, knowledge tests. The LSI identifies 4 learning styles, (Assimilating Diverging, Accommodating, and Converging). In some cases, learners present a balanced learning profile-an emphasis of all four equally. Statistical analysis consisted of t-tests and ANOVA. RESULTS: HF knowledge scores post-HPS compared to pre-HPS scores revealed a mean improvement of 7 points (p<0.001) showing evidence of learning. Within group score increases between the pre-test and post-test were seen for the Assimilating (66.68±20.87 to 83.35±12.59; p=0.07), Diverging (61.95±11.08 to 69.86±12.33; p<0.01) and balanced profiles (64.4±12.45 to 71.8±10.14; p<0.01), but not for Converging or Accommodating profiles (73% of sample). Post-hoc paired t-tests revealed a large effect size for the Assimilators (0.91) and moderate effect sizes for both the Divergers and balanced profiles (0.67 and 0.65, respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that knowledge gains occur with HPS and provide evidence that HPS is an effective teaching methodology for nursing students identifying with most types of learning styles.

%X We created e-learning materials for psychiatric nursing as part of a project aimed at developing problem-solving ability in student nurses. The system consists of applying three functional study modules, namely, "understanding a case", "analysis", and "evaluation", to simulated patient cases. Many students find it difficult to visualize nursing situations in the field of psychiatric nursing. These materials make maximum use of the imaging features of computers to help students visualize the actual situation.

%X Introduction: Cure2Children foundation (C2C) collaborated with the Asiri Central Hospital (ACH) in Colombo, Sri Lanka to set up country's first Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit in June, 2014. Among many other challenges, one of the major challenges was to train nurses in a start up BMT unit to understand and competently provide care to BMT patients. Nursing education is generally inadequate in low and middle income countries. But as evidenced by several recent studies, the successful treatment of children with cancer highly depends on the provision of specialised nursing care that requires advanced knowledge and clinical skills. Keeping this in mind, C2C implemented blended learning education model to train local nurses in the new BMT unit at ACH. Blended learning is a combination of different interactive teaching methods which include internet-based learning coupled with traditional face-to-face lectures. The aim of this experience is to highlight the advantages of blended learning in maximising the ability of new nurses to improve their self confidence and advanced knowledge in a new clinical speciality such as BMT. Method: Six nurses were assigned to work in the BMT unit at ACH. All six nurses participated in the education program in a blended learning environment. This comprised of 2 weeks of interactive face-to-face lectures, e-learning activities, and 6 weeks of clinical supervision by BMT specialist nurse and physician. Education topics were BMT specific such as central line management, chemotherapy administration, infection prevention and control, family education, quality management and data management. Results: At the end of the education program the evaluation data was collected from the assessment test results after the course which consisted of scenarios and multiple choice questions (N=75) relevant to BMT nursing care prepared by BMT nursing and medical coordinator. All 6 nurses completed the assessment in C2C database (BMT plus). On average nurses score was 66% with the highest score 80% and lowest 51%. Nurses reported that the knowledge gained through the course was fully transferable to their daily practice and boosted their confidence in clinical decision making. The BMT unit at ACH has so far performed 4 allogeneic matched related transplants for thalassemia major with a 100% success rate. Conclusion: This experience demonstrates that blended learning positively impact the orientation of new nurses and offers a cost effective alternative to residential learning methods in which nurses from developing country travel to developed country which is rarely feasible. This approach also makes training more flexible with potential to be delivered in a variety of settings without extensive disruption to work schedule. Moreover, this experience may help organisation focusing on international outreach in deciding and planning future education for nurses in start up centres.

%X A team of nurses trained and dedicated to the insertion and maintenance of PICC can reduce costs, optimize the time of the nursing staff, reduce bloodstream infection rates and reduce complications related to the usage of a PICC line. This study is an experience report. After the initial process, seven nurses were selected, and all have achieved an average score of more than eight in e-learning training and practical training with dolls and pigs. During the period from July 22, 2011 to December 31, 2011 were 103 PICC placements were requested, however, 23 were contraindicated, 78 were successfully inserted and 25 were procedure failures. At this early stage, the number of contraindications reached 25 % due to the limitation of the conventional technique in performing venipuncture successfully. At the end of the sixth month we noticed a significant increase in requests, reaching 28 requests in December 2011 versus 4 in July of the same year. Planning has become critical to project success. We started developing the institutional protocol, choosing the best device with the technique that offers our customers greater safety and quality. An institutional training was also carried out as this, was a new infusion therapy device in the institution, with different dates and times for all employees and promoted to all clinical staff. The result of this process was the addition of a new device that can be used with different types of treatments, bringing more safety and comfort with low rates of complications related to PICC.

%X Brazil is the fifth largest country by area in the world, and has a great social inequality and serious difficulties in securing physicians in areas with little infrastructure, located far from major centres. For 2014, it is estimated that 576 000 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in Brazil, out of which 188 000 will be skin cancer [Gomes da Silva JA, Ministério da Saude, Instituto Nacional de Câncer. Estimativa 2014: Incidência de Câncer no Brasil. Available at: http://www.inca.gov.br/ estimativa/2014/estimativa-24042014.pdf (last accessed 20 May 2014)]. In 2004, a tertiary hospital located in the state of São Paulo started a skin cancer screening programme by way of prevention mobile units (PMUs) in remote regions of the country (Mauad EC, Silva TB, Latorre MR et al. Opportunistic Screening for skin cancer using a mobile unit in Brazil. BMC Dermatol 2011; 11: 12). The goal of this study was to demonstrate the preliminary results of using a mobile unit as a tool for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer in several poor regions of Brazil. These mobile units travelled through some Brazilian states providing specialized medical care for a population who had great difficulty in gaining access to this type of care. The PMU, built on the platform of a 10-m-long articulated van truck, is equipped with an outpatient room and small surgical centre, having a daily operating capacity of 40 patients affected by skin cancer, including minor surgeries and cryotherapy. Every city visited by the PMU had a local nurse, who was responsible for performing a triage of the patients to be seen. These nurses undergo annual training with the PMU staff. The results showed that in the last 5 years (2009-2013) 23 220 patients were seen, of whom 5222 underwent surgical procedures and 4500 (86 2%) had positive anatomopathological results for pathological skin cancer. Out of all positive cases, 98 5% were nonmelanoma skin cancer and 1 5% were melanomas. Most lesions (93 7%) were diagnosed at clinical stage 0 and 1 (Union for International Cancer Control). Thus, the work performed in the PMU has proved to be effective for screening, early diagnosis and treatment of malignant skin tumours in remote regions of Brazil.

%X Background The role of the acute stroke nurse is increasing in importance with regard to the process of delivering thrombolysis and in the day-to-day management of the stroke patient's hospital admission. Established in 2012, the national ASNEN aims to support education and collaboration amongst Australian acute stroke nurses. Unrestricted educational grants were received from Boehringer Ingelheim Pty Ltd and Stroke Society of Australasia (SSA) to support initiatives. Methods During 2012-13 the 10-member ASNEN Steering Committee met 14 times via teleconference, webinar, and face-to-face meetings. 1.5 hour workshops were held during the 2013 SSA and 2013 SmartStrokes Annual Scientific Meetings (ASMs) in Darwin and Brisbane, with a $200 travel grant offered to nurses attending the SSA Workshop. A national webinar, “The changing face of acute stroke care”, was held during the 2013 Stroke Week, with support from Boehringer Ingelheim Pty Ltd, the SSA, and the National Stroke Foundation. The ASNEN website was developed and made functional. Trialling of NETSMART Junior, an online stroke nurse education platform, in the Australian context was undertaken. Results 40 nurses attended the SSA ASM workshop, while 80 attended the SmartStrokes ASM workshop. 21 $200 travel grants were paid to stroke nurses attending the SSA ASM. 55 separate log-ins were utilised for the national webinar with over 200 attendees in total. 150 of these attendees were added to ASNEN database. Feedback from the workshops and webinar was overwhelmingly positive, both for the content and for the ASNEN to continue as an ongoing entity. Conclusions The first full year of the ASNEN's establishment has shown that this initiative was needed. From attendance numbers and feedback from workshop's and webinars, it has been shown that an educational gap is being addressed. Further development of the ASNEN website shall see acute stroke nurse interaction and education made increasingly more accessible and streamlined.

%X Despite the criticality of nurse rostering practices, there is a surprising lack of attention paid to this managerial activity both in practice and in the health-service management literature. This paper reports the results of an inductive, empirical study of rostering practices in the UK National Health Service with a view to developing a shared understanding of roster planning processes and of what constitutes rostering effectiveness. A survey of rostering practices in 50 wards, followed by five in-depth, longitudinal case studies, revealed the complexity of rostering activities, and identified the main design parameters, which were used to specify rostering systems and to prepare periodic rosters. Rostering activities were perceived to directly impact upon service delivery, resource utilization and nurse retention. A number of poor rostering practices were identified, which could lead to dysfunctional behaviour. This analysis points to a clear managerial imperative to improve local competencies in roster planning and control, recognizing their strategic significance in contributing to hospital effectiveness. A 'Strategic Roster Planning and Control (SRPC)' model is proposed, which may provide a framework for evaluating rostering effectiveness, and a platform for the sharing of best practice, in order to stimulate organizational learning and achieve nationwide improvements in hospital performance. © 2008 Royal Society of Medicine Press.

%X Background: At our education institution, Medical Imaging, nursing, chiropractic and mental health professionals, came together to create a virtual learning experience in Second Life. While simulation learning is not new, having been widely adopted in a range of disciplines such as architecture, business and medicine (Bloomfield, 2008; More & Burrow, 2008; Wiecha et al. 2010), the concept of three-dimensional (3D) avatar simulation is a new learning and teaching strategy for our four disciplines. The study aims to: 1) investigate the use of a 3D simulated environment as a learning platform for health science students to develop effective communication skills with patients; and 2) promote interdisciplinary learning and understanding amongst healthcare students. Methods: To achieve the first objective, the module was offered in four separate components but linked together via a single patient journey - the journey of a patient who was experiencing difficulty in breast feeding her baby. The patient was first seen by the Lactation Consultant, who then referred the patient to the Chiropractic and Mental Health clinics and the Medical Imaging department. Students from each discipline role played the interactions that occur between the healthcare practitioner and patient. To promote interdisciplinary understanding and learning, students were required to participate in blog discussions designed to engage them on issues such as professional roles and responsibilities, and the dynamics of healthcare teams. Students were also required to observe and reflect on the role plays from other disciplines. Results In summary, the preliminary findings from this 2011 study confirm our 2010 pilot study (Sim et al. 2011) where students found avatar learning to be highly effective in assisting them to develop empathy for patients. Another major benefit is the increased interdisciplinary understanding our students have learned from blog discussions. While our students reported Second Life learning to be fun, interactive and stimulating, a majority has identified technological problems they encountered to be extremely frustrating and prevented them from engaging in deeper learning. These findings were consistent with the case studies reported by Bloustien and Wood (2011). Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest several strategies that need to be addressed to mitigate some of the negative experiences and maximize the affordances of such unique learning environments. This presentation will demonstrate the potential of 3D simulated learning environments for engaging learners while also highlighting the challenges and strategies educators need to adopt to maximize the benefits for learning.

%X Introduction Insufficient skills in drug dose calculation may increase the risk for medication errors. Nursing students and trained nurses, as well as medical students and physicians, ascertain that this is a difficult subject.1 Different didactic methods are available for training purposes, and e-learning is increasingly used in health professions' education.2 Learning flexibility and cost considerations make E-learning an interesting alternative to ordinary classroom teaching for nurses in working situation. The aim was to compare these didactic methods in drug dose calculation. Materials & Methods Nurses from hospitals and community healthcare were invited to participate in a course in drug dose calculation, and randomized to either two days e-learning or one day classroom teaching combined with one day self study with text book. Before and after the course the nurses underwent a multiple choice test in drug dose calculation consisting of 14 tasks with four alternative answers (score 0-14), and asked how certain they were in each answer (score 0-3). High risk of error was defined as being certain that incorrect answer was correct. Demographical, educational and work related information were recorded. The results are given as mean (SD). Results Sixteen males and 167 females participated in the trial. Age and working experience were 42.0 (9.5) and 12.3 (9.5) years, respectively. Total score improved from 11.1 (2.0) to 11.8 (2.0) (p<0.001), and the difference in improvement in favour of the classroom group was 0.3 (ns, p = 0.35). Classroom teaching was significantly superior to e-learning among participants with low score (<9) at inclusion (p = 0.02) (post-hoc analysis). Mean certainty score increased from 2.0(0.6) (=relatively certain) to 2.2(0.6), p<0.001, with no difference between the groups. Mean no. of answers with high risk of error increased from 1 (range 0-6) to 1.2 (range 0-7) of the 14 tasks (ns, p = 0.13). Factors associated with high score after training were: high score at inclusion, working in hospital and postgraduate specialization. Discussion & Conclusion The prior knowledge as well as the learning outcome were judged as unsatisfactory, and were without significant differences between the didactic approaches. The possibility for individual advice in the classroom could explain the benefit of classroom teaching for nurses with insufficient prior knowledge, and the short course (2 days) might explain the overall low learning outcome. Some individuals showed high risk of error both before and after course. To improve the skills among nurses in drug dose calculation it seems necessary to individualize the didactic methods, and reconsider the content and regularity of the courses. Regular recertification of nurses should be considered.

%X The Chief Nursing Officer's recent review of mental health nursing called for the widespread involvement of mental health service users in the education of mental health nurses. This paper describes an innovative project that involved mental health service users in the education of pre-registration mental health nursing students through an online discussion forum that blended e-learning with enquiry-based learning (EBL). The findings of an evaluation are presented, drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the project was a success with students and service users engaging in online discussions on a range of issues. EBL presentations demonstrated understanding of the service user experience and students reflected on implications for clinical practice. All participants would take part again and recommend the online forum to others. Analysis of activity data revealed different levels and styles of student involvement. Limitations in communication skills appeared to limit student participation, alongside logistical difficulties, whereas the service users eagerly utilised the forum. Potential implications for healthcare education are discussed and recommendations made for developments in user-led e-learning and further research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X E-learning involves the transfer of skills and knowledge via technology so that learners can access meaningful and authentic educational materials. While learner engagement is important, in the context of healthcare education, pedagogy must not be sacrificed for edu-tainment style instructional design. Consequently, health professional educators need to be competent in the use of current web-based educational technologies so that learners are able to access relevant and engaging e-learning materials without restriction. The increasing popularity of asynchronous e-learning programs developed for use outside of formal education institutions has made this need more relevant. In these contexts, educators must balance design and functionality to deliver relevant, cost-effective, sustainable, and accessible programs that overcome scheduling and geographic barriers for learners. This paper presents 10 guiding design principles and their application in the development of an e-learning program for general practice nurses focused on behavior change. Consideration of these principles will assist educators to develop high quality, pedagogically sound, engaging, and interactive e-learning resources.

%X Knowledge and skill acquisition related to vascular access are traditionally individual institutional educational initiatives. Australia currently has no national evidence based education programme for renal nurses. A survey of Australian and New Zealand Nephrology Educators' conducted in 2009, identified the need for more effective and consistent delivery of clinical education for nurses using innovative, web-based approaches supporting the tenets of e-learning methodologies. This paper discusses the development, implementation and proposed evaluation of a peer reviewed Australasian e-learning programme on buttonhole cannulation. It will further highlight the benefits of inter-organisational partnerships and how these partnerships can facilitate positive change in teaching and learning practices. This project has unique characteristics that collectively provide value, distinction and innovation to nurses, patients and renal departments. As the e-learning programme was founded on a platform of evidence-based practice it is therefore easily transferable to an international context. © 2011 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care Association.

%X Summary: Training is an essential component of HAIs, wher IT can play a major role. The objective was to develop an e learning continuous education programme for knowledge and skill based competency building in infection control. An interview was conducted and an on line e learning module was developed by a team. It improved the participation of HCWs in training. The competency, knowledge, practices and updating of recent advances was impressive. Process, outcome indicators improved and it proved to be cost effective. Introduction: Training with IT aid would be the call of the day. Objectives: Develop an e learning continuous education programme in infection control. Methods: An interview was conducted to understand the impact of continuous education class room sessions, Pilot study was conducted. Team was included towards programing and deveopment. Every staff will get a user id and a password. An article with 10 MCQs, was released by the inservice administrator, open for the staff for the period of two weeks. They can attempt MCQs and grade them simultaneously and do simlulation training. Results: 1344 nursing staff, 48% of the staff were able to attend the class room session. 38% of the lectures were missed. Important topics were missed by the staff. Skill based learning was appreciated more. 88% of staff felt that e-learning improved their knowledge, skills and practice. 76% felt it allows flexibility in attending the sessions. 91% of the staff have started attending. Quality indicators in infection control and nursing, staff's knowledge and skills had improved from 43% to 87%. Hand washing compliance improved from 47% to 78% in the hospital after institution of e learning and continuous reminders. Cost towards training has reduced from Rs 7 lacs per annum to 1.5 lacs per annum. Conclusion: There is a remarkable improvement in knowledge, competency and skills. Attendance, process, outcome and cost showed improvement.

%X Background: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) consists of the biochemical triad of ketonaemia, hyperglycaemia and acidaemia. DKAremains a significant clinical problem in spite of improvements in diabetes care. Method: This was a retrospective audit looking at the acute management of DKA in patients admitted to Scunthorpe General Hospital over a 12-month period. Results: Twenty-seven patients were audited. Fifteen patients (56 per cent) were females. The average age was 35 years. 59 per cent of patients had previous admission withDKAand 26 per cent hadDKAin the previous 12 months. In our cohort poor compliance with insulin therapy was the leading cause of DKA constituting 47 per cent of patients. The majority of patients (67 per cent) spent less than 3 h in A & E prior to transfer to the medical admission unit. 44 per cent of patients received intravenous fluids within 30min of admission and 52 per cent received insulin within 60min; only 48 per cent had adequate potassium monitoring. 74 per cent of patients stayed less than 5 days, and only 78 per cent of patients were reviewed by the diabetes team prior to discharge. Conclusions: Management ofDKA in our hospital is still suboptimal despite the regular conventional staff training and dissemination of guidelines.We recommend an alternative mode of education to front- line medical and nursing staff using compulsory e-learning modules with one face to face taught session. In additionwe proposeamonthly review by the diabetes team for management of all patients admitted withDKAduring this period,who have the responsibility to account for any training or facilities gaps identified.

%X Objectives: To assess the efficacy of an exercise program on a whole-body vibration platform (WBV) in improving body balance and muscle performance and preventing falls in institutionalized elderly people. Design/Setting/Participants: A multicentre randomized parallel assessor-blinded clinical trial was conducted in elderly persons living in nursing homes. Interventions: Participants were randomized to an exercise program performed either on a whole body vibratory platform (WBV plus exercise group) or on a stationary surface (exercise group). The exercise program for both groups consisted of static and dynamic exercises (balance and strength training over a 6-week training period of 3 sessions per week). The frequency applied on the vibratory platform was 30 to 35Hz and amplitude was 2 to 4mm. Measurements: The primary outcome measurement was static/dynamic body balance. Secondary outcomes were muscle strength and number of falls. Efficacy was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. The effects of the intervention were evaluated using the t test, Mann-Whitney test, or chi-square test, depending on the type of outcome. Follow-up measurements were collected 6weeks and 6months after randomization. Results: A total of 159 participants from 10 centers were included: 81 in the WBV plus exercise group and 78 in the control group. Mean age was 82years, and 67.29% were women. The Tinetti test score showed a significant overall improvement in both groups (P<.001). No significant differences were found between groups at week 6 (P=890) or month 6 (P=718). The Timed Up and Go test did not improve (P=599) in either group over time, and no significant differences were found between groups at week 6 (P=757) or month 6 (P=959). Muscle performance results from the 5 Sit-To-Stand tests improved significantly across time (P=001), but no statistically significant differences were found between groups at week 6 (P=709) or month 6 (P=841). A total of 57 falls (35.8%) were recorded during the follow-up period, with no differences between groups (P=406). Conclusion: Exercise program on a vibratory platform provides benefits similar to those with exercise program on a stationary surface in relation to body balance, gait, functional mobility, and muscle strength in institutionalized elderly people. Longer studies in larger samples are needed to assess falls.

%X Institutionalized older persons have a poor functional capacity. Including physical exercise in their routine activities decreases their frailty and improves their quality of life. Whole-body vibration (WBV) training is a type of exercise that seems beneficial in frail older persons to improve their functional mobility, but the evidence is inconclusive. This trial will compare the results of exercise with WBV and exercise without WBV in improving body balance, muscle performance and fall prevention in institutionalized older persons. An open, multicentre and parallel randomized clinical trial with blinded assessment. 160 nursing home residents aged over 65 years and of both sexes will be identified to participate in the study. Participants will be centrally randomised and allocated to interventions (vibration or exercise group) by telephone. The vibration group will perform static/dynamic exercises (balance and resistance training) on a vibratory platform (Frequency: 30-35 Hz; Amplitude: 2-4 mm) over a six-week training period (3 sessions/week). The exercise group will perform the same exercise protocol but without a vibration stimuli platform. The primary outcome measure is the static/dynamic body balance. Secondary outcomes are muscle strength and, number of new falls. Follow-up measurements will be collected at 6 weeks and at 6 months after randomization. Efficacy will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis and 'per protocol'. The effects of the intervention will be evaluated using the "t" test, Mann-Witney test, or Chi-square test, depending on the type of outcome. The final analysis will be performed 6 weeks and 6 months after randomization. This study will help to clarify whether WBV training improves body balance, gait mobility and muscle strength in frail older persons living in nursing homes. As far as we know, this will be the first study to evaluate the efficacy of WBV for the prevention of falls. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01375790.

%X Impairment of vision is associated with a loss of function in activities of daily living. Avoidance of physical activity and consequent reduced functional capacity is common in older people with visual impairment and an important risk factor for falls. Indeed, the rate of falls and fractures is higher in older people with visual impairment than age-matched visually normal older people. Depression and anxiety is common in older people with vision impairment and leads to further restriction of activity, reduced social contact and reduced quality of life. Possible mechanisms to reduce activity restriction and therefore improve mobility and activity include environmental and behavioural interventions delivered by a number of health professionals, including occupational therapists. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of environmental and behavioural interventions in reducing activity limitation and improving quality of life amongst visually impaired older people. We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to November 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2012), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (January 1937 to November 2012), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to November 2012), OT Seeker (inception to November 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 November 2012. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (Q-RCTs) that compared environmental interventions, behavioural interventions or both, versus control (placebo control or no intervention or usual care), and trials comparing different types of environmental or behavioural interventions, in older people (aged 60 and over) with irreversible visual impairment living independently or in residential settings. To be eligible for inclusion the primary aim of studies must be reducing physical activity limitation and must include a measure of physical activity. Secondary outcome measures included falls, fear of falling, quality of life. Two authors independently read abstracts retrieved by the search to identify eligibility and study quality. We contacted study authors for additional information. Our searches found no RCTs or Q-RCTs that met the eligibility criteria for this review. We are unable to reach any conclusion about the effectiveness of environmental or behavioural interventions for reducing physical activity limitation in community-dwelling visually impaired older people, as no eligible studies were found. However a number of studies reviewed included only the secondary outcome measures of this review. Although behavioural interventions delivered by occupational therapists have been shown to reduce the rate of falls, we are unable to conclude if this is due to reduced activity restriction (increased mobility) or reduced activity (lessening exposure to risk). There are inconclusive and conflicting results from trials evaluating the effectiveness of behavioural and environmental interventions aimed at improving quality of life. Further research is necessary (such as ongoing Dutch and UK trials considering the effectiveness of orientation and mobility training on activity restriction, physical activity, falls, fear of falling and quality of life in older adults with low vision, and the effect of an occupational therapist delivering home safety modification, coping strategies and exercise with older people with low vision) before any conclusions can be reached.

%X Background: Patients with bleeding disorders in rural and remote areas face well-known challenges to timely and appropriate emergency management. We identified common scenarios in these areas resulting in avoidable transfers to our tertiary centre and developed an innovative program to close this gap in service. Aims: Our aim was to create a local platform of care to support patients living in rural and remote locations. It included providing professional health care education and support, routine supply of clotting factor concentrate, community awareness to facilitate local treatment by enabling local care partnerships through enhanced lines of interagency communication. Methods: Four rural areas with a high demand for our services or a large population of patients were identified as pilot sites. In consultation with key local stakeholders, we formed a multidisciplinary outreach team to develop and trial the program consisting of education and community information sessions, onsite in-services for medical, nursing and allied health care professionals with ongoing patient communication and program evaluation. Results: One pilot site has reached the final stage. The local General Practitioners facilitate acute care coordination. Education of the hospital staff has been successfully completed with new policies and procedures implemented. Since implementation of the program at this site there have been five recorded bleeds requiring intervention, three of which were successfully treated locally. Two required transfer for specialist intervention however received factor prior to transfer. The three remaining locations are well on track and initial activities have commenced. Local supply of coagulation factor has commenced in all sites. Conclusion: Rural and remote treatment can be successful. Overall the program not only benefits the patients and their families, but also provides local health care professionals with the required resources, leading to reduced hospital admissions and its associated cost of treatment.

%X Introduction: The core competencies of professionalism and interpersonal and communication skills (PICS) have proven the most difficult to teach, measure and evaluate. Despite guidelines that we have in our existing toolbox, education of emergency medicine residents and students in these areas remains challenging and nebulous. Residents not adequately trained in PICS may be unprepared and may perform poorly on patient satisfaction surveys (PSS) when starting their emergency medicine careers. The education of PICS is a difficult task. Just the mention of these topics is enough to prompt a deep sigh and eye rolling response from many of our learners. Project Professionalism (PP) is a «resident-friendly and resident-approved» curriculum. It has been developed with significant resident input and participation. Resident volunteers were solicited through e-mail, with all interested respondents welcomed to participate. Representatives from all PGY levels are included. Residents participated in selection of topics, and development and delivery of workshops. The primary audience for this curriculum is emergency medicine residents. Medical students and off-service residents rotating through the ED will be a secondary audience for some aspects of the training. Objectives: To provide emergency medicine learners with PICS training with 3 primary goals in mind: 1) to improve communication with patients and their families, 2) to improve interactions and professional relationships with colleagues from other services, 3) to prepare residents for high achievement on measures of PICS, particularly PSS. Methods: This is a series of lectures, small group and role-playing exercises. The modules will be presented in a longitudinal fashion throughout the 4 years of residency. Each PGY level will receive one hour of focused instruction pertinent to their roles and responsibilities at that particular PGY level. All PGY levels and rotating medical students will receive quarterly sessions during weekly didactic conference. Topics include roles and responsibilities, communication, ethnic and cultural sensitivity, mutual respect for all team members, social media, leading by example, teaching tools and techniques, patient satisfaction, competent consultations, delivering difficult news, challenging patients, and dealing with difficult people. Learners will receive 360-degree evaluations during their ED rotations from patients, peers, nurses, students, and ancillary staff. Conclusion: PP is a structured curriculum filling the void in education of PICS. Considerable resident involvement makes this curriculum palatable and successful. This curriculum is highly transferrable, and deserves a place in the every emergency medicine educator's toolbox.

%X Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) programme on the performance of nurses in the recognition of child abuse in a simulated case in the Emergency Department (ED). Design: Blinded, randomised controlled trial using preand postintervention design. Setting: The ED of a University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Participants: 38 ED nurses were included, 25 nurses were analysed. Intervention: Half of the participants followed a 2-h e-learning programme focused on the recognition of child abuse, the others acted as a control group. Main outcome measurements: Individual performance during a case-simulated parent interview to detect child abuse and self-reported self-efficacy for the detection of child abuse. Performance on the simulation was scored by an expert panel using a standardised assessment form which was designed to score quantity and quality of the questions posed by the nurse (minimum score 0; maximum score 114). Results: During post-test, nurses in the intervention group performed significantly better during the simulation than the control group, (89 vs 71, 95% CI 2.9 to 33.3), and reported higher self-efficacy (502 vs 447, 95% CI -25.4 to 134.7). Performance in detecting child abuse correlated positively with the self-efficacy score (Spearman correlation 0.387, p value 0.056). Comparing post- and pretest results separately for the intervention and the control group showed a significant increase in performance in the intervention group. Conclusion: E-learning improved the performance in case simulations and the self-efficacy of the nurses in the ED in the detection of child abuse. Wider implementation of the e-learning programme to improve the first step in the detection of child abuse is recommended. Trial registration: Protocol registration system of clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00844571.

%X BACKGROUND: An accurate handover of clinical information is of great importance to continuity and safety of care. If clinically relevant information is not shared accurately and in a timely manner it may lead to adverse events, delays in treatment and diagnosis, inappropriate treatment and omission of care. During the last decade the call for interventions to improve handovers has increased. These interventions aim to reduce the risk of miscommunication, misunderstanding and the omission of critical information. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve hospital nursing handover, specifically:to identify which nursing handover style(s) are associated with improved outcomes for patients in the hospital setting and which nursing handover style(s) are associated with improved nursing process outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies: Cochrane EPOC Group specialised register (to 19 September 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to 1 March 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 March 2013) OvidSP, EMBASE (1947 to 1 March 2013) OvidSP, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1980 to 1 March 2013) EbscoHost and ISI Web of Knowledge (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index) (to 9 July 2012). The Database of Abstracts of Reviews (DARE) was searched for related reviews. We screened the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/ and Current Controlled Trials www.controlled-trials.com/mrct and we conducted a search of grey literature web sites. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs or cluster-RCTs) evaluating any nursing handover style between nurses in a hospital setting with the aim of preventing adverse events or optimising the transfer of accurate essential information required for continuity of care, or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 2178 citations, 28 of which were considered potentially relevant. After independent review of the full text of these studies, no eligible studies were identified for inclusion in this review due to the absence of studies with a randomised controlled study design. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence available to support conclusions about the effectiveness of nursing handover styles for ensuring continuity of information in hospitalised patients because we found no studies that fulfilled the methodological criteria for this review. As a consequence, uncertainty about the most effective practice remains. Research efforts should focus on strengthening the evidence abut the effectiveness of nursing handover styles using well designed, rigorous studies. According to current knowledge, the following guiding principles can be applied when redesigning the nursing handover process: face-to-face communication, structured documentation, patient involvement and use of IT technology to support the process.

%X We implemented a community telehealth project in the three towns in the Darling Downs area of Queensland over a 2-year period starting in July 2012. The purpose of the project was to generate telehealth activity in hospitals, general practice and selected residential aged care facilities. Telehealth education and training was provided to clinicians in the three towns and a community awareness campaign was delivered using advertisements in newspapers, messages in social media and presentations at community events. A total of 55 stakeholders were engaged with during 61 site visits to health care facilities during the first two years of the project. During the study period, telehealth activity in Queensland increased in the hospital sector by 39% and in the non-hospital sector by 99%. In the Darling Downs region, telehealth activity in the hospital sector increased by 104%, compared to 28% in the rest of Queensland. However, in the non-hospital sector, the increase in telehealth activity in the Darling Downs region was similar to the rest of Queensland. Telehealth services established and/or facilitated by the project included specialist geriatric ward rounds in Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles for patients in the local hospitals and nursing homes; and ad-hoc teleconsultations for children and adults living in these communities, with specialists at Toowoomba and hospitals in Brisbane. An increase in telehealth implies better access to a range of clinical services, which may result in improved clinical outcomes for patients.

%X PURPOSE OF STUDY: The purpose of this quality improvement study was to evaluate the impact of a novel educational intervention on nurse case managers' (NCMs') perceived role ambiguity, role conflict, and use of nursing competencies. Specific aims were to apply the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Synergy Model for Patient Care to determine the use of the model's nurse competencies in acute care case management, to pilot test the feasibility of using widely available basic computer technologies to facilitate NCMs' orientation in acute care settings, and to establish the foundation for future work in developing an evidence-based orientation program for new NCMs based on a nursing conceptual framework. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Two acute care community hospitals in northeastern Ohio, both part of a large national hospital corporation. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: The sample consisted of NCMs who were actively employed in 1 of 2 acute care hospitals and voluntarily agreed to participate in this quality improvement study. Data on perceived role conflict and role ambiguity, perceived use of nurse competencies in bedside nursing and in case management, demographics, and evaluative feedback were collected using Google Docs. The intervention consisted of a series of four self-paced computer-based learning modules that provided participants with an introduction to acute care nursing case management based on the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Synergy Model. RESULTS: Four of the 6 role ambiguity subscale item scores revealed reductions in role ambiguity after the educational intervention. A statistically significant decrease in one role conflict item was observed. Participants rated the use of all nurse competencies as higher in case management than in bedside nursing practice; the variance between the two further increased after the intervention. Statistically significant differences in the use of clinical judgment, advocacy/moral agency, and caring practices were identified. Participants reported that the educational content would be valuable for new NCMs transitioning from bedside clinical practice. The addition of case studies or clinical scenarios illustrating each nurse competency was suggested. Testing of the Synergy Model-based education modules with novice case managers actively transitioning from the bedside to a case management role will be the next step in the development of this program. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: : The use of widely available computer technologies to deliver introductory case management orientation content is feasible, although conversion to a web-based platform is recommended. Evidence-based strategies to prepare NCMs for expanded competency in clinical judgment, advocacy/moral agency, and caring practices are needed.

%X Context Age-related hearing loss can impair patient-provider communication about symptom management, goals of care, and end-of-life decision-making. Objectives To determine whether hospice and palliative care providers screen for or received training about hearing loss, believe it impacts patient care, and use strategies to optimize communication. Methods This was a national survey of hospice and palliative care providers conducted via email and social media. Survey questions were pilot tested with multidisciplinary providers in San Francisco. Results Of 510 responses (55% age 50+ years, 65% female, 64% in practice 5+ years, 57% practiced hospital-based palliative care, 45% hospice), 315 were physicians, 50 nurses, 48 nurse practitioners, 58 social workers, and 39 chaplains. Ninety-one percent reported that hearing loss has some or great impact on the quality of care for older adults. Eighty-eight percent recalled a situation where hearing loss created a communication problem with a patient and 56% a communication problem with a caregiver. Eighty-seven percent of physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners reported not screening for hearing loss. Although 61% felt comfortable with their communication skills for patients with hearing loss, only 21% reported having received formal training in its management, 31% were unfamiliar with resources for patients with hearing loss, and 38% had never heard of a pocket talker amplification device. Conclusion Hospice and palliative medicine providers believe age-related hearing loss impacts care yet most do not screen. Although they feel they are managing well, few have formal training. Knowledge about management approaches and resources is suboptimal.

%X Objective: In the United States, it is estimated that 1 in 400 individuals will harbor a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 genes. Among those affected with breast cancer, approximately 5%-10% can be associated with a hereditary component. In addition, approximately 1 in 440 individuals will have a predisposition to early-age colon, uterine, gastric, and ovarian cancer associated with Lynch syndrome and polyposis (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, and MYH genes). Benefit has been demonstrated for both oncology and unaffected patients through detection of mutations with impact on surgical, surveillance, and chemoprevention options. The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient and sustainable practice-based model to integrate assessment and testing for hereditary cancer within a 179-physician multispecialty group. Methods: In June 2012, our breast surgery program implemented a simple process to identify and screen patients for hereditary cancer using a sustainable workflow with the following components: • A hereditary cancer risk assessment (HCRA) questionnaire was created and evaluated based on NCCN guidelines for HBOC, Lynch and polyposis syndromes • HCRA forms were given out to all incoming surgery, mammography, and oncology/hematology patients. • HCRA forms were reviewed by trained nurses; patients with history that met NCCN criteria were offered risk assessment and hereditary cancer testing when appropriate. • All patients were provided with pre-test risk assessment and informed consent. • Test results were reviewed by physician and a detailed patient-specific management plan was communicated to the patient and primary physician. • Upon presenting results, consultation with a certified community-based genetic counselor was offered to patients. Preparation prior to process implementation included observation of patient flow, training on hereditary cancer syndromes, and commitment to continued process improvement. Results: In the 18 months prior to implementation, 4 patients received testing and 1 was positive for a deleterious mutation. Postimplementation revealed a 6.5% positive rate for deleterious mutations (see following figure), which is consistent with rates seen in other studies. The systematic nature of this process allows a platform for ongoing quality improvement. (Figur Presented) Conclusion: Comprehensive screening with a systematic process for evaluating hereditary cancers identified high-risk patients in a large multispecialty clinic. In the first 16 months of this process we were able to provide personalized cancer risk management to 471 patients. Screening patients in Surgery, Oncology and Mammography resulted in a 6.5% positive rate, which will also impact management of blood relatives.

%X Purpose: The purpose of this research study was to determine attitudes towards human patient simulation (HPS) as a learning modality. A secondary purpose was to determine competence in clinical reasoning skills of physical therapy (PT) students as applied to an orthopedic patient case involving total joint replacement. Relevance: There is a paucity of literature on the effects of educational methods employing HPS use inPT. It is important to critically evaluate the use of HPS in educational experiences in PT curriculums. Description: Students (n = 8) enrolled in an orthopedic PT course participated in a case scenario utilizing a human patient simulator. Information regarding the participant's preferred learning style was collected prior to the learning experience. Students worked in groups of 4 assuming different roles (PT clinician, PT tech, Nurse, PT student) during the simulation. The case involved presentation of a patient following total hip replacement with signs and symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Students were able to interact with the human simulator via microphone. Instructors were able to remotely control the human simulator and were able to see and hear the simulation as it occurred in real time and review the experience after it occurred by the use of videotape. A Likert scale survey assessing attitudes towards orthopedic patient management and clinical decision making in the acute care setting was collected immediately prior to and after the learning experience. Participants also completed a short qualitative survey after the experience. Evaluation: The majority of participants preferred an active (50%) learning style, liked learning facts (sensing 88%), and preferred information presented and sequentially (87%) and visually (100%). Overall, participant confidence in managing a patient with an orthopedic impairment improved from 50% to 88% (Strongly agree/agree). Confidence in management of patients with total hip replacement improved from 50% to 100%. Both prior to and following the experience, one hundred percent of participants strongly agreed that practice with HPS would benefit their learning. Qualitative themes identified were that participants would have liked more and repeated HPS experiences throughout the semester; that HPS would improve readiness for clinical education, and that HPS would assist in identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses. This learning experience highlighted poor clinical decision making skills by the students. All of the participants failed to recognize the absence of anticoagulant therapy; 50% missed the early warning signs of DVT and chose to proceed with mobilization. However, these participants were able to make appropriate clinical decisions once the HPS progressed to a pulmonary embolus. Conclusions: Human patient simulation is a useful tool for improving confidence in orthopedic acute care management across learning styles. HPS may also be used to identify areas for improvement in clinical performance and clinical decision making which is vital for management of patients in the acute care setting. Implications: HPS assists students in translating classroom knowledge and increasing confidence in clinical practice. It allows complex patient situations that require high levels of knowledge and interpretive skills to be utilized, while limiting risk to patients in the acute care setting.

%X The inaugural EndoLive UK held in the International Convention Centre (ICC) Birmingham on the 12-13 March 2015 was a watershed moment for UK endoscopy and for the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). The event provided the perfect platform to demonstrate how the UK is delivering some of the highest quality endoscopic practice, training and research in the world. Organised by UK endoscopy experts and supported by internationally renowned endoscopists such as Professors Paul Fockens, Douglas Rex and Peter Siersema, EndoLive UK pushed back the boundaries of innovation and interaction during a 'Live Endoscopy' event. Frontline Gastroenterology supported the event with a special edition of this journal dedicated to Endoscopic Practice in April 2015. With over 500 people from around the globe attending this first event, the aim of highlighting the very best of UK endoscopy on a national and international stage was achieved. Furthermore, the educational content of the course was developed to be accessible and appropriate to a variety of clinicians with different levels of experience - endoscopy trainees, nurses, General practitioner (GP) endoscopists, gastroenterologists and surgeons. This article reviews this event and its many highlights and successes.

%X The use of high-fidelity human patient simulation (HPS) is increasing in nursing education, yet little is known about its use in community health. This study examined an HPS home care experience to determine effects on three outcomes (student satisfaction, self-confidence, and learning). In addition, design characteristics of the simulation and demographic characteristics of students were examined for correlation with these outcomes. Senior baccalaureate students took part in the experience. Results indicated that students were very satisfied with the experience and felt it increased their confidence in providing care in the home, although learning outcomes were not high. Although no demographic characteristics were found to be correlated with outcomes, five design characteristics of a simulation were moderately correlated with the outcomes of satisfaction and self-confidence, especially support. It is recommended that nurse educators design HPS home care simulation experiences that provide student support prior to their first home care visit. © The Author(s) 2011.

%X Introduction: The success of transplant programmes is determined by the attitude towards donation[1],[2]. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and the attitude of healthcare staff and lay people regarding transplantation. Materials and Methods: The results of previous investigations carried out with the same method were compared. The knowledge and the attitude of lay people (European Donation Day 2012; n=257) concerning transplantation and brain death were compared to those of students of Semmelweis University Faculty of Health Sciences (BSc, MSc, ambulance care assistants; n=111), congress of anaesthesiologist assistants and intensive care nurses (AITSZME 2013; n=98), and emergency care nurses (2015; n=78). The date were analysed with SPSS 20.0. Results and Discussion: There was a higher percent of male and elder participants in the lay group (42.8% vs. 15%; p=0.000; 36.3 vs. 45.1 years; p=0.000). Compared to lay people, professionals were able to define brain death in a higher percentage (86.1% vs. 71.2%; p=0.000), but no difference was found regarding the acceptance of brain death: 41.5% accepted the fact without reservation that the brain-dead is identical with death, 44.5% with reservation, while the others refused it. Although 71.0% of the healthcare staff and 59.1% of the lay people (p=0.004) were familiar with the legal requirement of the strong version of presumed consent principle, a significant number of the healthcare staff (84.1% vs. 66.9%; p=0.000) supported the everyday practice demanding family consent. More young people (p=0.028; OR: 1.027), women (p=0.049; OR: 2.060), and lay people (p=0.004; OR: 3.273) were willing to donate their own organs, while the donation of their relatives' organs was supported in a higher percentage by lay people (p=0.000; OR: 3.235), participants familiar with the relevant legislation (p=0.020; OR: 1.715), and participants accepting brain death (p=0.000; OR: 2.545). A higher percent of the lay people gained information about donation in newspapers (40.6% vs. 21.8%; p=0.000), on internet (48.6% vs. 33.7%; p=0.000), and on television (65.8% vs. 40%; p=0.000), whereas 70.2% of the healthcare staff were informed about it in the medical care system (70.2% vs. 28.8%, p=0.000). Only a limited number of the participants were provided information by leaflets (9.0%) and patients associations (15.7%). Conclusions: Although the surveys cannot be considered representative, they draw the attention to that fact that professionals have a more profound acquaintance of transplantation proceedings, but this knowledge does not influence the acceptance of brain death and the attitude towards donation in a positive way. While society can be reached through social media, the healthcare professionals' attitude can be changed only with targeted training. To determine the most effective educational methods for enhancing donation representative and comprehensive inquiries are needed.

The Golden Minute
%X Background: The Golden Minute®, the first minute following birth of a newborn, is a critical period for establishing ventilation after delivery, as emphasized in the Helping Babies Breathe® and other resuscitation training programs. Previous studies have reinforced training through observers' evaluation of this time period; although observation is useful for research, it may not be a sustainable method to support resuscitation practice in low-resource settings where few birth attendants are available. In order to reinforce resuscitation within The Golden Minute®, we sought to develop a simple mobile delivery-room timer on an Android cell phone platform for birth attendants to use at the time of delivery. Methods: We developed and evaluated a mobile delivery room timer to document the time interval from birth to the initiation of newborn crying/spontaneous respiration or bag and mask ventilation in a convenience sample of women who delivered in five hospitals in Karnataka, India. The mobile delivery room timer is an Android cell phone-based application that recorded key events including crowning, delivery, and crying/spontaneous respiration or bag and mask ventilation. The mobile delivery room timer recorded the birth attendant verbally indicating the time of crowning, birth-(defined as when the entire baby was delivered), crying/spontaneous respiration or bag and mask ventilation. The mobile delivery room timer results were validated in a subsample by a trained observer (nurse) who independently recorded the time between delivery and initiation of crying/spontaneous respiration or bag and mask ventilation. Results: Of the total 4,597 deliveries, 2,107 (46 %) were timed; a sample (n = 438) of these deliveries was also observed by a trained nurse. There was high concordance between the mobile delivery room timer and observed time elapsed between birth and crying/spontaneous respiration or ventilation (correlation =0.94, p < 0.0001). The majority of neonates in both groups cried/breathed spontaneously or received bag and mask ventilation by 1 min (430/438 by the timer vs. 433/438 for observer). Conclusions: We demonstrated that a simple mobile delivery room timer application was feasible to use during delivery and provided valid observations of the time to crying/spontaneous respiration or bag and mask ventilation. This type of tool may be useful in reinforcing neonatal resuscitation training and the need to ensure spontaneous or assisted ventilation by The Golden Minute®.

%X In the context of the current epidemics of obesity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, the prevalence and consequences of both OSA and CSA are likely to increase. Numerous hurdles face the cardiovascular community in the development of consensus regarding best practice. One objective of this document is to help develop the platform from which, in collaboration with specialists in sleep medicine and related disciplines, such consensus may emerge. Challenges to be met include 1) the general absence of any structured sleep medicine education in cardiovascular training programs; 2) the logistic and economic obstacles to diagnosing and treating sleep apnea; 3) widespread comorbidities, including obesity, that obscure clearer understanding of any independent cardiovascular consequence of sleep apnea per se; 4) treatment options that are varied, predominantly device based, and not easily tolerated, particularly in patients with CSA; and 5) the absence of robust longitudinal interventional studies addressing whether treating sleep apnea confers any tangible benefit in terms of cardiovascular events. We also remain uncertain about what in the apneic patient facilitates cardiovascular disease and its progression. There is no clear evidence as to the best measurement for quantifying the severity of sleep apnea. Is it the frequency of apneas, the severity of desaturation, the overall burden of nocturnal hypoxemia, the arousals, sleep deprivation, or a combination of these and perhaps other characteristics that are key in promoting heart and blood vessel damage? In addition, we do not know the threshold of severity of apnea that we should treat and whether the thresholds for therapy are different in people with cardiovascular disease compared with those who are otherwise healthy. Recognition that a multidisciplinary strategy is critical to appropriate evaluation of sleep-related disease (416) and heightened interaction between specialists in cardiovascular and sleep medicine hold promise for future improved and integrated patient care. In the meantime, the relative lack of definitive outcomes data to guide clinical practice necessitates a highly individualized approach to evaluation and management of those patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea. There will likely be continued rapid evolution in interpretation, dissemination, and implementation of mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic data. Evidence of activation of cardiovascular disease mechanisms by sleep apnea and evidence of sleep apnea as an independent etiologic factor in cardiovascular disease should serve as catalysts for definitive intervention studies. Important next steps in understanding and treating SDB as a means of preventing and mitigating cardiac and vascular disease should include further characterizing fundamental disease mechanisms, identifying economical and better-tolerated therapeutic options, confirming whether therapy attenuates cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and defining appropriate therapeutic targets and cost-effective benefits of such therapy. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc, and the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

%X A technological platform (MediGuide) has been recently introduced for non-fluoroscopic catheter tracking. In several studies, we have demonstrated that the application of this non-fluoroscopic catheter visualization system (NFCV) reduces fluoroscopy time and dose by 90-95% in a variety of electrophysiology (EP) procedures. This can be of relevance not only to the patients, but also to the nurses and physicians working in the EP lab. Furthermore, in a subset of indications such as supraventricular tachycardias, NFCV enables a fully non-fluoroscopic procedure and allows the lab staff to work without wearing lead aprons. With this protocol, we demonstrate that even complex procedures such as ablations of atrial fibrillation, that are typically associated with fluoroscopy times of >30 min in conventional settings, can safely be performed with a reduction of >90% in fluoroscopy exposure by the additional use of NFCV.

%X Background and aim: Podcasts have become popular e-learning resources in medical education. We carried out departmental audits and identified areas for improvement. Video podcasts were created to demonstrate how to improve aspects of care in our paediatric emergency department (PED), where best practice guidelines were not adequately followed, and to highlight areas where improvement was most needed. We conducted a survey of paediatric nursing staff mainly working in the PED in order to gain a better understanding of how well video podcasts as a potential tool for continuing education would be perceived. Methods: Three video podcasts, each 3-4 min long, on management of wheeze, management of acute gastroenteritis and guidance on correct positioning and analgesia use for paediatric lumbar punctures were shown to a random sample of paediatric nurses mainly in the PED, but also other paediatric areas. Devices used to demonstrate podcasts included smart phones, tablets and notebooks. A questionnaire for feedback was given to participants afterwards. Results: 42 questionnaires were completed. Only about a third had used podcasts before. More than half found the duration of the podcast ideal. Over 90% found the podcasts helpful. 92% agreed and strongly agreed that podcasts could play an important tool in continuing education and 84% would like to see more paediatric teaching podcasts. 89% stated they learned something from the podcasts, which would change their practice. Discussion: We demonstrated that the use of podcasts in the PED could play an important and helpful teaching role in keeping medical staff up to date. Podcasts were well perceived. The PED is a busy environment and patient needs naturally take priority over teaching schedules. Being able to be used on an individual basis away from team teaching sessions is another advantage of podcasts.

%X Nurses in the Stem Cell Transplantation Clinic (SCT) and the Apheresis Center of a large cancer center participated in the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) RN satisfaction survey. Although scores for Decision-Making, defined as the “opportunity to participate in administrative decision- making” and Autonomy, defined as “freedom in the workplace to make important decisions” were comparable to other institutions, nurse leaders were surprised they were not higher. Because nurses in the clinic work very independently and participate in developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) and meet regularly with the multidisciplinary team, the results were unexpected. In an effort to gain greater understanding of nurses' perceptions and opinions, quarterly autonomy rounds were established. The intent of the rounds with leaders was to provide a platform to discuss practice and operational issues that were satisfiers and dissatisfies. Bringing leaders of both areas and staff together was also a venue for resolving issues, refining processes and surfacing other concerns. Through autonomy rounds, issues such as repeated double and triple booking of appointments, resulting in long waits for the patients, and nurses feeling “caught in the middle”, began to surface and could be addressed. The outcome of this ongoing process has been positive. The Chairman and Medical Directors of both units have asked the nurses to participate with multidisciplinary teams to develop best practices. Nurses will also be involved in tracking variances of SOPs, trending them, providing that feedback to the team, and participating in necessary revisions. Leaders are looking forward to the next NDNQI Nurse Satisfaction survey results as another measure of expected success of the process.

%X More depictive than in- or outpatients, people with a neuromuscular condition have to be considered as 'revolving door' patients: one time in, one time out. Several times a year the patient with a neuromuscular condition has regular contacts with the rehabilitation hospital for multidisciplinary consultation or/and hospitalization (emergency or check-up), but also with the local team at home: general practitioner, physiotherapist, nurse. The patient clearly expects both teams to develop active communication and to make a functional network centered on him. In order to permanently share information, results and control, we can work in two parallel directions Hospital - patient at home: the patient leaves the hospital with the necessary technical equipment, e.g. ventilator for home-based ventilation, wheelchair, Percussionaire and Cough Assist for respiratory management, etc. The family will have been trained to use and control the techniques (e.g. alarms). The hospital team (e.g. occupational therapist and physiotherapist) regularly calls home visits for evaluation of patient's life (technical) conditions. On the other hand, the patient can contact the specialized team 24 hours a day in hospital and can be hospitalized at any time if needed. Hospital - local team: relationship between the hospital and the local team (general practitioner, physiotherapist, nurse) always turns out to patient's advantage: the local team can at any time liaise with the hospital team about specificities of the neuromuscular conditions and/or therapies. This can be achieved by personal contacts and by teaching sessions and/or e-learning techniques. Cost-benefit analysis of this approach is underway.

%X Objectives: The Choosing Wisely initiative, started by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Foundation in 2012, encourages the practice of evidencebased medicine in selection of diagnostic tests and treatment options. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of an educational initiative designed to enhance emergency provider knowledge surrounding ten initiatives chosen by the study team akin to those from the Choosing Wisely campaign and relevant to the practice of emergency medicine. Methods: This was a prospective, three-phase educational intervention study developed to assess the impact an educational campaign would have on emergency medicine provider practices in regards to ten clinical scenarios where diagnostic testing and treatment with medications may be safely avoided. The first phase consisted of administration of a 30-question, multiple-choice test based on ten initiatives designed by the study team to be akin to the initiatives adopted by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) for the Choosing Wisely campaign. All emergency medicine providers including residents, attendings and nurse practitioners at an urban academic center were identified and given the test. Following the pretest period, an educational program was deployed each subsequent week focusing on 2 of the 10 initiatives. This program consisted of lectures and presentations as well as emails and social media notifications. The third phase began after the 5-week education phase where the study subjects who completed the first phase test were given the same test. The questions were scored and the post-test results were compared with their corresponding pretest. Of the 30 questions presented to the emergency medicine providers, one question was thrown out due to disagreement on the most appropriate answer. There were six questions that had more than one correct answer, but distinct incorrect answers. Statistical analysis of the data was performed including derivation of the mean, standard deviation, and calculation of the paired t-test. Results: There were 57 completed pretests and 41 completed post-tests. Data from the 41 subjects who completed both the pre-and post-test were included in the analysis. All of the completed post-tests were matched with their corresponding pretest using de-identified subject numbers. The data were further analyzed based on experience level (attending providers, resident physicians, and nurse practitioners) and the results are demonstrated in the table below. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that an educational campaign designed to introduce practitioners to choosing wisely initiatives is able to statistically change provider knowledge on a pre/post testing format; however, this effect was largely due to the change in score of only one test group, resident physicians. Additional study is needed to assess the impact of the educational initiative using actual provider practice patterns in the clinical area.

%X The paper describes the implementation and acceptance of e-learning in a hospital environment using off-the-shelf technology. Twenty-eight nurses participated in a pilot study that was designed to support an electronic course on advanced electrocardiogram interpretation. The paper presents the procedure and the technologies used to support the e-learning activities. As a follow up of the pilot study, a survey was built and distributed amongst the caregivers of the hospital (N=203). The paper concludes first that the content of the course, a socially structured e-learning environment, as well as the available technologies are important factors to a successful implementation of an e-learning project. Secondly, the paper concludes that the acceptance of such a system to learn is widely supported amongst nurses but seems less convincing to paramedics and physicians. E-learning cannot be perceived as a substitute of a traditional face-to-face education, but when the e-learning environment is socially well structured, it becomes an efficient support to education in the hospital context.

%X The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive outlook on nursing education reforms enacted in Western Europe in the last three decades. Specifically, this analysis aimed to describe major trends in the implementation processes of nursing education reforms and the current academic status of nursing programs across Western Europe. A critical analysis of the scientific literature and policy documents was conducted. The results indicate that two major phases of reform were initiated in nursing education over the last three decades. The first phase was geared at creating a unified European platform of solid preregistration programs. The second phase was predominantly geared at integrating nursing programs into higher education institutions. In contrast to the first stage of reform, which yielded unity, the second phase resulted in a notable variation among existing structures, levels of education, duration of studies, and the titles (degrees) awarded. As a result, Western Europe today represents a myriad of arrangements for preregistration nursing programs. Nursing has viewed these reforms in the education system as vital in promoting the profession and crucial for responding to the reforming health care system. This research indicates that nursing goals have only been partially obtained. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Historically, the instructional method of choice has been traditional lecture or face-to-face education; however, changes in the health care environment, including resource constraints, have necessitated examination of this practice. A descriptive pre-/posttest method was used to determine the effectiveness of alternative teaching modalities on nurses' knowledge and confidence in electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation. A convenience sample of 135 nurses was recruited in an integrated health care system in the Southeastern United States. Nurses attended an instructor-led course, an online learning (e-learning) platform with no study time or 1 week of study time, or an e-learning platform coupled with a 2-hour post-course instructor-facilitated debriefing with no study time or 1 week of study time. Instruments included a confidence scale, an online EKG test, and a course evaluation. Statistically significant differences in knowledge and confidence were found for individual groups after nurses participated in the intervention. Statistically significant differences were found in pre-knowledge and post-confidence when groups were compared. Organizations that use various instructional methods to educate nurses in EKG interpretation can use different teaching modalities without negatively affecting nurses' knowledge or confidence in this skill.

%X Background: The multidisciplinary staff at a large, comprehensive children's hospital and newly opened women's and fetal center recognized an opportunity to enhance nursing knowledge base in the care of complex cardiac patients and their families. Annually, the hospital sees over 17,000 patients with cardiac disease. Method: As a result of a NICU & CVICU collaborative, bedside education rounds were initiated. Weekly rounds were intentionally developed as a supportive, non-threatening platform for informal dialogue amongst disciplines. Results: Initial results and informal feedback from staff was mixed. Rounds were not announced and some NICU staff initially felt intimidated while other front-line staff enthusiastically engaged in discussions and described them as thought provoking. The participating CVICU physician and Clinical Nurse Specialist occasionally experienced unreceptive NICU staff. Conclusion: The structure of multidisciplinary education rounds for the cardiac population has been established. Future plans include placing anatomical diagrams at the bedside to enhance pre and post-operative understanding. Additionally, an upcoming extension of rounds will include neonates in the CVICU to focus on nutrition and developmental care.

%X Despite the ongoing nursing shortage, nurse educators are responsible for preparing students to practice in highly complex health care systems. As nurse educators explore new learning strategies to support an increase in student admissions, they must also evaluate the impact of these strategies on the quality of the educational experience. The study reported here evaluated the impact of scenario-based, high-fidelity patient simulation used to increase student admissions in an associate degree and baccalaureate nursing program in north-central Texas upon students' sense of their own clinical competence, graduating grade point average (GPA), and performance on standardized exit examinations. These are measures commonly used by nurse educators as metrics of success.

%X The overall aim of this study was to explore current remote symptom support training programs provided to nurses in ambulatory oncology programs across Canada, using a survey-methods environmental scan. Of 36 delivered invitations, 28 programs responded (77.8%) representing 10 provinces. Of 25 programs that offer telephone symptom support, 17 provide symptom support training, seven do not, and one did not say. Seven programs shared training materials with the investigators and elements of training included: symptom management guidelines (n = 6), telephone triage process/principles (n = 5), competent telephone practices (n = 4), documentation (n = 4), professional standards (n = 3), role-play (n = 3), communication skills/etiquette (n = 3), and monitoring quality (n = 1). Formats included: presentations (n = 3), paper-based resources (n = 3), or e-learning modules (n = 1). No training programs were rigorously evaluated. Training in telephone nursing symptom support across oncology programs is variable. Opportunities exist to identify core competencies and evaluate if training programs enhance delivery of remote cancer symptom support.

%X A Royal College-backed National Early Warning System (NEWS) has been proposed, to standardise the assessment of acute-illness severity in the NHS.1 Coupled with any such scoring system, a graded response strategy is required in response to a changing patient condition.2 Effective local implementation presents organisational, cultural, and resource challenges, and the impact on an individual Trust or hospital site is not yet fully understood. A systematic, phased rollout of NEWS was implemented at a large acute hospital where care bundle and other standardised service improvements had already taken place.3 Baseline notes audit revealed poor recording of physiological observations, inadequate use of the existing modified early warning score (MEWS) and poor escalation of deterioration. Hospital wide audit of observations charts confirmed poor compliance with MEWS and poor understanding of the existing graded response strategy. A multidisciplinary implementation group including Trust heads of nursing, clinical leads from all acute specialities and intensive care, site management, and resuscitation services, was convened to supervise an integrated implementation involving many aspects of the acute care system. An observation and escalation policy was implemented at ward level, with Board support. A recognised Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation (SBAR) reporting tool was adopted and implemented. Intensive face to face training, a Royal College of Physicians e-learning package,4 hospital- wide screensavers, and medical training and governance sessions were fully utilised to introduce the system to all users. A medical emergency team (MET) system was implemented using existing on-call resources and with defined membership and responsibilities within and out of hours, and hospital communications systems were modified to provide rapid MET activation at appropriate NEWS levels. A trial period of four weeks on three acute medical wards resulted in widespread acceptance and use of NEWS, and an extended pilot phase took place for a further five months after which NEWS was rolled out to three surgical wards. After a further six months NEWs was implemented hospital-wide. Referral to outreach increased by 397% from a mean of 36.6 per month to a mean of 182 per month over a period of 12 months. One ward showed a drop from 13 to five cardiac arrests over one year, but there was no overall impact on cardiac arrest rate across all areas. A multi-layered implementation of NEWS including structured response systems and communication tools, results in widespread acceptance and uptake. NEWS implementation substantially increases referrals to Outreach, with resource implications. There was insufficient data to show impact on cardiac arrests.

%X Anticoagulants are one of the classes of drugs most frequently identified as causing harm and admission to hospital. The successful management of the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy can reduce the chance of patients being harmed in the future. The National Patient Safety Agency's anticoagulant safety alert in 2007; (National Patient Safety Agency (2007a) Patient Safety Alert, Actions that make anticoagulant therapy safer. London, NPSA) highlighted the need for all staff caring for patients receiving anticoagulant therapy to have the necessary work competencies. It was stressed that any gaps in staff competency was to be addressed through training to ensure that all staff can safely undertake their duties. The Anticoagulant team at the West Suffolk Hospital recognised the need for further staff training and were able to include an e- learning session within the annual mandatory Trust training days. The team submitted PowerPoint presentations and multiply choice questions for qualified nurses and consultants. An 80% pass mark is required and the staff participating are informed immediately of any questions incorrectly answered and given a chance to resubmit their answers. Managers are informed of unsuccessful participants who are given the chance to retake the failed session The e-learning sessions have now been in use for 12 months and formal evaluation has found that most staff found the format informative and helpful. The contents of the presentations have now been changed to ensure that staff do not repeat the same session twice. Although increasing staff awareness at the West Suffolk Hospital will not result in complete prevention of harm to patients due adverse effects of anticoagulant therapy, this area of the NPSA alert continues to be a priority for the anticoagulant team who are now developing an e-learning package for Foundation Year doctors.

%X Background and Purpose: The University Hospitals Neurological Institute (UHNI) Neuroscience Nursing Practice Center (NNPC) was approached by nursing leaders within the healthcare system to develop a standardized neurological nursing assessment that would target non-neuroscience nurses. As hospitals develop subspecialty services, nurses become increasingly uncomfortable caring for patients with unfamiliar diagnoses; however, 7-15% of all strokes occur in hospitalized patients, most of whom are post-surgical or post-procedural. The NIH Stroke Scale is used in many stroke units, but as a primary measure of ischemic stroke severity, is limited in its capacity to assess subtle deficits or assess patients with other neurologic emergencies. Methods: Neuroscience nurses and nurse educators were identified representing community and tertiary care within an 11 hospital health system. The group met multiple times over 6 months and determined that the program required the identification of learning needs, a curriculum and educators, and a mechanism for the education to reach all targeted nurses. Results: Learning needs varied considerably across the health system hospitals. Learning objectives were developed to incorporate these needs. A power point presentation was generated to teach a basic neurological assessment with a focus on stroke; this included the NIHSS. A Neuro-Education Ambassador Program was offered to nurse managers within the health system and participants were identified from the hospitals to attend a regional Train the Trainer retreat. These retreats include an interactive demonstration of how to complete the NIHSS as an added assessment tool. The participants are provided the core presentation along with speaker notes and these Neuro-Education Ambassadors then disseminate the standardized neurological nursing assessment to their system hospitals. Conclusions: The standardized neurological nursing assessment and the Neuro-Education Ambassador Program were enthusiastically supported by health system nurse leaders. A pre and post retreat test was developed to measure the effectiveness of this program in improving stroke awareness and increasing confidence in the performance of a neurological assessment among non-neuroscience nurses. Future goals of the UHNI-NNPC are to use this infrastructure to develop standardized nursing documentation in an electronic medical record within the healthcare system.

%X Introduction: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies physical impairment caused by stroke. Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians must be competent to perform the NIHSS as scale cut points are utilized to identify patients with acute ischemic stroke who may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Simulation is a teaching method that integrates imitation of real life scenarios into educational exercises. This study discerned if standardized patient simulation can be adopted into an educational exercise aimed at training EM residents to adequately perform the NIHSS. Methods: This preliminary study was completed with EM residents, in various years of training, from a single academic center. All residents attended a lecture on performance of the NIHSS. Each resident then performed the NIHSS on 2 patients with chronic, fixed neurological deficits. Residents were observed by a NIHSS certified healthcare professional who gave immediate feedback on examination technique. Data was analyzed with basic statistics using means and standard deviations (± SD). Results: Twenty eight EM residents, 7 NIHSS certified healthcare professionals (1 Neurologist, 5 Neurology residents, 1 nurse), and 7 patients participated in the trial. Mean certifier NIHSS score of patients was 2.7 (SD ±1.6). Resident score exactly correlated with certifier score in 11/56 examinations (20%), was within ±2 points of the certifier score in 28 examinations (50%), and within ±3 or 4 in 17 examinations (30%). Average time to complete one patient examination was 5 minutes 36 seconds (SD ±1 min 3 sec). In a post exercise survey, all residents rated this training experience as being beneficial to their medical training. Conclusions: An educational format incorporating didactic and return demonstration aimed at training a large group of EM residents to competently perform the NIHSS is practical. Immediate feedback on examination technique and a relatively short time to complete the educational exercise are advantages of this format compared to on-line training modules often used to educate physicians. Further refinement of this exercise is necessary before it can be used for the purpose of NIHSS certification.

%X Advances in computerized and imaging technology permit both students and doctors to depict the anatomy of the human pelvis more realistically than with previous methods. Further refinements outline fine pelvic structures, such as the nerve plexus, which may as a result be spared during major pelvic surgery, thus preserving the function of the bladder neck and urethra. Dynamic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, coupled with three-dimensional depiction of the lower urinary tract and its adjacent structures, enable visualization of the whole lower urinary tract and the pelvic floor musculature in both continent and incontinent women. In patients with a reconstructed lower urinary tract computer-assisted image processing shows the postoperatively altered topographical anatomy. This may be clinically useful for interpretation of unexpected findings with conventional imaging modalities, postoperative morbidity, and surgical planning of a lower abdominal reoperation. Examples of our own work regarding the innervation of female pelvic organs, dynamic depiction of the bladder and pelvic floor musculature during straining in normal and incontinent women, and the situation of female patients after undergoing an anterior pelvic exenteration with subsequent orthotopic neobladder procedure, are given. In addition, the data of these patients have been compiled for virtual reality endoscopy, which is useful for patient consent and for teaching residents, students and nurses.

BACKGROUND: A form of social networking, Twitter is considered a useful means of communication, particularly with millennials. This method was chosen based on current literature exploring the characteristics of millennial students. METHOD: Ahern's Model of Adolescent Resilience served as the theoretical framework. Participants were 70 junior-level baccalaureate nursing students, ages 19-23, at two state-supported universities. RESULTS: Twitter was found to be a convenient, cost-effective, and enjoyable means of intervention delivery for the researcher. Participants in the experimental and control groups expressed positive feelings about the use of Twitter. CONCLUSION: The findings contribute to future efforts to use social media in nursing research and education to increase faculty-student engagement, promote critical reflection, provide social support, reinforce course content, and increase the sense of community.

%X Background: A key activity of the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority (The Authority) 2009 health reform was employing specialist donation staff (SDS) dedicated to improving organ and tissue donation processes in hospitals. Southern Health (SH), which is Victoria's largest health service, has experienced a threefold increase in Organ donation since the implementation. Alternative methods of education delivery have eventuated to meet staff need. The paper reports on the development of an E Learning Portal to deliver interactive and accessible education to all staff involved in the organ and tissue donation process. Method: SDS utilised a strong knowledge base, and linked with an external IT consultant to place clinical knowledge in a usable interactive format. Four modules were proposed by the SDS. The first was the National Clinical (GIVE) trigger. This module was launched in February 2012 The GIVE Trigger is used in all Emergency Departments and Intensive Care units to identify potential donors. This was subsequently followed by the second module, Eye and Tissue donation, which was launched in October 2012. This module was designed for all medical and nursing staff. Results: Over 700 SH staff have completed the online modules. Organ and tissue donation recognition, approach and consent rates are at an all-time high for the organisation which can be partly attributed to an increased awareness and understanding formed from the E Learning portal. Conclusion: Due to the success of the E Learning Portal in SH, Donatelife Victoria has engaged with the SDS to launch the GIVE Trigger module across the jurisdiction. The eye and tissue module is also being adapted and made available to all hospitals across the state. E learning activities are now strategic activities at a National Level.

%X Within Scottish hospitals transfusion education is mandatory for all staff involved in the process of transfusion. Currently two modes of delivery exist, face-to-face and e-learning. The researcher, a transfusion practitioner, wished to evaluate the perceptions of registered nurses within her local children's hospital to the transfusion education available.The aim of the evaluation was to ascertain whether there were perceived benefits, whether expectations were met and whether nurses perceived that there were any barriers to undertaking the education. Both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained by means of a questionnaire; all registered nurses in the hospital were invited to participate.The study indicates a high level of compliance with mandatory transfusion education and suggests both satisfaction and perceived benefits with transfusion education among those who responded. Some barriers were highlighted, but it was noted that these were not exclusive to transfusion education and in the current challenging environment with conflicting priorities on time, resolution may be complex.

%X Program/Project Purpose: Long standing underinvestment in nursing and midwifery education continues to limit the ability to train sufficient number of nurses and midwives with the appropriate clinical skills to meet population health needs. When HIV positive patients seek care in Africa, they will in all likelihood get treated by a nurse. They will also have their babies delivered by, their children immunized from, and their common as well as uncommon ailments, whether diarrhea, pneumonia, tuberculosis, malaria, cholera or Ebola, treated by a nurse. Increased investment is required to address the need for more nurses, training them better, and ensuring they have the necessary support to remain at the front lines, caring for the most vulnerable. Structure/Method/Design: In 2009, ICAP at Columbia University began implementation of the PEPFAR funded Global Nurse Capacity Building Program (GNCBP), which consists of two subprojects, Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) and General Nursing (GN). GNCBP aims to improve population health by fostering individuals, institutions, and networks to expand, enhance, and sustain the nursing and midwifery workforce by achieving three objectives: (1) Improve the quantity, quality, and relevance of nurses and midwives to address essential population-based health care needs, including HIV and other life-threatening conditions; (2) Identify, evaluate and disseminate innovative human resource for health models and practices that are generalizable for national scaleup of nursing and midwifery education; and (3) Build local and regional partnerships to provide technical and capacity building support for nursing and midwifery policy, regulatory and faculty development, curricula reform, continuing professional development and retention, and high impact nursing leadership. ICAP works collaboratively with relevant ministries, nursing bodies and education institutions to build local capacity and country ownership in the 13 countries where GNCBP is implemented. Outcomes & Evaluation: To date, efforts to equip nurses and midwives with the clinical skills needed to meet population health needs, have led to over 10,000 pre-service nurses enrolled in 19 NEPI-supported nursing schools, 9 simulation skills labs and 4 model wards established, 15 curricula newly developed or revised to be competency-based and up-to-date, 43 faculty enrolled in higher education at the Masters and PhD level, and national standards for nursing education implemented. Tools developed include a “Campus to Clinic” mentorship guide for HIV care, a clinical simulation training program, a webinar series on curriculum development, and an e-learning module on the Option B+ approach to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. South to south exchanges have fostered regional dialogue and experience sharing. Going Forward: Continued advocacy for and investment in nursing education and training are required to ensure that enough nurses are fit to practice and purpose.

%X Background The COME-ON study is a cluster-controlled trial in 63 nursing homes in Belgium which aims to optimize the appropriateness of prescribing for nursing home residents. The core intervention consists of interdisciplinary case conferences supported by training and local concertation. An interdisciplinary case conference is a discussion between physician, pharmacist and nurse about the medication schedule of an individual resident. The objective of these meetings is to identify drug-related problems (DRPs) and to obtain consensus on the interventions that will be implemented. Purpose The purpose was to develop a user-friendly, comprehensive and reliable tool to classify and electronically register DRPs and interventions. Method The first draft of this DRP classification tool was based on literature (adapted from Basger et al. (2015) and on the PCNE classification V6.2). This draft was tested by experienced researchers and community pharmacists. Panel members were asked to categorize clinical cases according to our DRP classification tool. These results were compared to check for inter-rater reliability and content validity. Using several rounds of validation adjustments were made to obtain consensus on the final version. Findings The final version of the DRP classification tool includes categories for the type of DRP, the cause of DRP and for the planned intervention. As in existing tools, the type of problem can be categorized as potential or as actual. Causes can be classified as related to drug selection (a), drug form or route (b), dose selection (c), treatment duration (d), drug use (e), not-documented discrepancies in the medication list (f), monitoring (g), unavoidable side effect (h) and other (i). Some of these main categories consist of sub-items. The final tool contains 20 items to classify the causes of DRPs and 17 items to categorize the interventions. To support the implementation of this classification tool, training was provided to all health care professionals involved in the COME-ON study. Therefore, a narrative PowerPoint and exercises were incorporated in an e-learning program. Moreover, the classification was applied during on-site training sessions using clinical cases. Conclusion The final DRP classification tool can be considered as a reliable and valid tool that is based on existing classification systems, which allows comparison between studies. The strength of our tool is that it is adapted to the nursing home setting and to interdisciplinary case conferences. Belgian nursing homes (of the intervention group) involved in the COME-ON study are currently performing these interdisciplinary case conferences and hence reporting drug-related problems and planned interventions.

%X There is an increasing role for heart failure (HF) nurses with extended clinical expertise and delegated responsibilities in many European countries. Further, many nurses seek an academic accreditation for their experience, skills and knowledge. Objectives: To describe the experiences of implementing a European curriculum for clinical expertise in HF nursing that was developed by the Heart Failure Association and the Council for Cardiovascular Nurses and Allied Professionals of the European Society of Cardiology. Methods: Data on implementation were collected from 5 educational programmes in 4 countries: Sweden, Norway, Germany (2) and Spain. Data collection included number of attendees, modes and methods of teaching, assessment of clinical and theoretical competencies and course evaluations. Results: Both in Norway and Sweden 25 nurses underwent the programme. In Germany, 8 courses were held including 74 nurses. In Spain, 84 nurses are currently involved in an online course. The course extent varies between 200-400 hours in total. In Norway the course is part of a post graduate specialization in cardiovascular nursing on a master degree level. In Sweden the course can be part of a master degree. The clinical learning methods were supervised consultations, practical opportunities for skill acquisition, case presentations and multidisciplinary group work. The theory based were tutorials, lectures, seminars and self-tuition. Sweden used a web-based tool for the anatomy/physiology sections. In Spain, the whole course is given online allowing the students to connect to the platform at their convenience. This also applies to the teachers from different geographical areas in Spain thus allowing to operate on lower cost. In one of the German sites an evidence-based telephone-monitoring is taught as part of postdischarge management. Examinations consist of individual written (often multiple choice) and oral exams, group exams and case presentation. Course evaluations were consistently high, and students perceived that the syllabus sufficiently covered the HF area and was relevant for clinical practice. Conclusions: The challenges of implementing the curriculum for HF nursing in Europe were met. Entry requirements for the nurses, the organisation of the training, requirements and role of educational supervisor and training centers as well as a regular update on the content are important areas for ongoing improvement. Further, it is important that the specialised HF nurses contribute to health care and that their new education is a career opportunity to more advanced tasks and responsibilities.

%X Objective: While research has examined stigma and negative attitudes towards those identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, less is known about the experience of transgender (TG) individuals, especially in healthcare settings. The Attitudes Towards Transgendered Individuals Scale (ATTI) is a 20-item measure assessing TGrelated stigma, separate from discrimination or violence, in the general population. The ATTI has demonstrated reliability and validity when used with emergency (EM) clinicians. Therefore, we sought to evaluate EM clinician (physician, nurse, and advanced practice provider) attitudes towards TG individuals. Methods: EM clinician attitudes towards TG individuals were evaluated using the ATTI and a demographic survey. Participants completed the 20-item instrument in an anonymous fashion using an electronic platform. Results: 73 clinicians participated; 36 (52.9%) identified as medical providers while 32 (47.1%) identified as nurses or other provider types. 56% of participants (n=38) were female and most (n=60, 88%) identified as heterosexual. The mean ATTI score for the group was 85.3 (SD 11.404, 95% CI: 82.5-88.1), where higher scores indicate more positive attitudes towards TG persons. Differences in ATTI scores were noted based upon clinician role with non-medical providers (nurses and others) scoring higher than their medical colleagues (90.1 vs. 80.9, mean difference 9.2, 95% CI: 4.1-14.4, p < 0.001). Those who indicated that they personally know someone who identifies as TG also scored higher on the ATTI (91.0 vs. 81.5, mean difference 9.5, 95% CI: 4.2-14.8, p < 0.001). In addition, ATTI scores for women were higher than for men (89.5 vs. 80.2, mean difference -9.3, 95% CI: -14.4-4.1, p < 0.001). No differences in ATTI scores were noted across age groups (F=0.430, p=0.732). Conclusions: Findings suggest that in this setting, EM clinicians possess generally positive attitudes towards TG individuals, with ATTI scores higher than those previously reported in the general population. In addition, differences in mean ATTI score were noted based upon professional role, gender, and prior experience with TG people. These findings provide a baseline for assessing the effect of interventions focused on improving EM clinicians' TG cultural competence and may also be useful in addressing barriers to seeking EM care faced by members of the TG community.

%X Background: Clinically meaningful quality measures have been identified as a catalyst for healthcare improvement and better patient outcomes. Amidst rapidly changing quality reporting and re-imbursement schema, eligible providers struggle to choose a portfolio of measures across multiple registries that will demonstrate the value of their practice to consumers and payers. It is critical that a roadmap to quality improvement be evident to registry users. Utilizing the Model for Improvement developed by the Associates in Process Improvement and adapted to health care by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a framework to guide performance improvement was developed and incorporated into an oncology specific QCDR for PQRS reporting. Methods: Fourteen patient-centered quality measures with a focus on cancer related symptom assessment and intervention were piloted and tested in 40 practices and incorporated into the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS)/CE City QCDR. Six measures focus on the active treatment phase of cancer care and eight on breast cancer survivorship. The registry platform was designed with capabilities for tracking of data over time, goal setting, benchmarking, and providing suggested performance improvement (PI) activities. A technical expert panel (TEP) was convened to develop a model to guide PI activities to address QCDR identified practice gaps. Results: A quality improvement framework was developed to help QCDR subscribers answer the question “How Do I Improve” and was incorporated into the ONS/CE City QCDR platform. This framework provides the subscriber with the education and training necessary to improve care through use of quality improvement tools and implementation strategies aimed at practice change. Conclusions: It is essential that measures be incorporated into an infrastructure that provides opportunities for the assessment and improvement of care quality provided by practices. The QCDR can act as a means to drive performance improvement along with supporting quality measurement for PQRS and Meaningful Use reporting. The “How Do I Improve” Framework developed as part of the ONS/CE City QCDR platform provides a model to accomplish this goal.

%X Objectives: We introduce "Mobile Nurse" (MN) - an emerging platform for the practice of ubiquitous medicine. Methods: By implementing in a dynamic setting of daily life the patient care traditionally provided by the clinical nurses on duty, MN aims at integral data collection and shortening the response time to the patient. MN is also capable of intelligent interaction with the patient and is able to learn from the patient's behavior and disease sign evaluation for improved personalized treatment. Results: In this paper, we outline the most essential concepts around the hardware, software and methodological designs of MN. We provide an example of the implementation, and elaborate on the possible future impact on medical practice and biomedical science research. Conclusions: The main innovation of MN, setting it apart from current tele-medicine systems, is the ability to integrate the patient's signs and symptoms on site, providing medical professionals with powerful tools to elucidate disease mechanisms, to make proper diagnoses and to prescribe treatment. © 2007 Schattauer GmbH.

%X Background. More than 85% of pediatric cancer cases and 95% of deaths occur in resource-poor countries that use less than 5% of the world's health resources. In the developed world, approximately 81% of children with cancer can be cured. Models applicable in the most resource-poor settings are needed to address global inequities in pediatric cancer treatment. Procedure. Between 2006 and 2011, a cohort of children received cancer therapy using a new approach in rural Rwanda. Children were managed by a team of a Rwandan generalist doctor, Rwandan nurse case manager, Rwanda-based US-trained pediatrician, and US-based pediatric oncologist. Biopsies and staging studies were obtained in-country. Pathologic diagnoses were made at US or European laboratories. Rwanda-based clinicians and the pediatric oncologist jointly generated treatment plans by telephone and email. Results. Treatment was provided to 24 patients. Diagnoses included lymphomas (n = 10), sarcomas (n = 9), leukemias (n = 2), and other malignancies (n = 3). Standard chemotherapy regimens included CHOP, ABVD, VA, COP/COMP, and actino-VAC. Thirteen patients were in remission at the completion of data collection. Two succumbed to treatment complications and nine had progressive disease. There were no patients who abandoned treatment. The mean overall survival was 31 months and mean disease-free survival was 18 months. Conclusions. These data suggest that chemotherapy can be administered with curative intent to a subset of cancer patients in this setting. This approach provides a platform for pediatric cancer care models, relying on local physicians collaborating with remote specialist consultants to deliver subspecialty care in resource-poor settings.

%X In the developed world approximately 80% of children with lymphoma can be cured. As global health initiatives have broadened to address noncommunicable diseases the approach to cancer care for children in resource poor settings becomes of increasing concern. Traditional models of tertiary care provision will not be applicable as there is not an adequate number of existing pediatricians subspecializing in oncology to provide for the world's children. At Rwinkwavu, a Partners In Health (PIH) supported government district hospital in rural Rwanda, a small cohort of children with lymphoma have received therapy over the past 4 years using a unique approach to care delivery. Each case is managed by a team consisting of a Rwandan physician with no specialty training, a Rwandan nurse coordinator focused on oncology patients, a Rwanda-based US trained pediatrician and a US- based pediatric oncologist. Biopsies and radiologic staging studies were obtained in Rwanda but all pathologic diagnoses were made at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching hospital, through a formal arrangement. A treatment plan for each patient was formulated with the consulting pediatric oncologist and a road map was generated. Chemotherapy was administered by nurses in the Rwinkwavu pediatric ward under the daily supervision of the local generalist and with the support of the pediatrician. Blood counts and broad spectrum antibiotics were available but blood cultures could not be performed. If radiation therapy was required patients were transported to Uganda for the treatments. Ten patients aged 3-15 (median age 9.5 years) have been treated using this approach. 5 (50%) have completed therapy - Hodgkin's Disease (HD) n =2, HIV-associated large cell lymphoma (HIV LCL) n =2, Burkitt's Lymphoma (BL) n=1. They received either CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone), n=3 or ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine), n=1; 1 patient with Stage 1 Lymphocyte Predominant HD is being observed without adjuvant therapy after complete surgical excision. All 5 have no evidence of disease recurrence 4 months - 4 years following completion of therapy (median = 14 months). 2 patients are currently on therapy (recurrent HD, HIV LCL) and are in remission. 2 patients succumbed to treatment complications (HD- died from cardiomyopathy, BL- died from transverse myelopathy) and 1 patient (BL) died of progressive disease while receiving chemotherapy. We can not determine the number of pediatric patients with lymphoma who died before a diagnosis was made or before receiving appropriate therapy. In the developing world lymphoma is one of the most common oncologic diseases in children. These data suggest that chemotherapy can be administered with curative intent to a subset of these patients in the setting of a confirmed pathological diagnosis. This approach provides a platform for models of care that rely on local physicians acting in concert with trained consultants from the developed countries to deliver subspeciality care in resource poor settings.

%X BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome among adolescents has not been effectively addressed by current campus-based health promotions. Using the Internet in these promotions may help health professionals achieve better healthcare management. PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the design requirements of an e-health management platform from the subjective perspective of adolescent girls who were at a high risk of metabolic syndrome. The findings may provide a reference for designing nursing interventions that more effectively promote healthly lifestyle habits to adolescents. METHODS: This qualitative study employed a snowball approach and used a semi-structured interview guide to collect data. A total of 20 Taiwanese adolescent females who were at a high risk of metabolic syndrome, aged 16-20 years, able to speak Mandarin or Taiwanese, and willing to participate and to have their sessions tape-recorded were enrolled as participants and engaged individually in in-depth interviews. The constant comparative method was used to inductively analyze the interview data. RESULTS: Five main themes related to the e-health management platform emerged from the data. These themes included: an attractive and user-friendly website interface, access to reliable information and resources, provision of tailored health information, access to peer support, and self-monitoring and learning tools. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings highlight the key design needs of an e-Health management platform from the perspective of adolescent girls who are at a high risk of metabolic syndrome. The identified themes may be addressed in future revisions / developments of these platforms in order to better address the needs of this vulnerable population and to effectively reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome. The authors hope that the results of the present study may be used to provide better healthcare and support for adolescent girls with metabolic syndrome.

%X PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop an e-Learning program about medication for nurses to enhance nurses' medication performance ability and to analyze learners' responses after studying with this program. METHOD: For the development of the e-Learning program, the NBISD(Network Based Instructional Systems Design) model, suggested by Jung(1999) was applied as a basic model and the instruction design theory of Gagne & Briggs(1979) and ARCS theory of Keller(1983) were applied. After the operation of this program for one month to 34 new nurses, learners' responses were analyzed. RESULT: Learners' knowledge of medication was greatly improved after this program. In addition learners' satisfaction with the overall education program, help in field applicability, ease of screen shift and exploration, and tutor activities were high and the contents were regarded suitable for e-Learning. Many things were advantageous such as easy accessibility, easy understandability with pictures and flash animation, practical cases and feedback from a tutor. Provision of a supplementary handout and improvement of a tight time schedule were pointed out as things to be improved. CONCLUSION: This e-Learning program can be used effectively for medication education for registered nurses, student nurses, and new nurses.

%X Background and Context: The provision of optimal cancer care is complex and involves a range of multidisciplinary health professionals and settings. The widely distributed and heterogeneous nature of the cancer workforce in Australia presents particular challenges to professional learning and development. Cancer Australia's national cancer control agency, through Cancer Learning, provides online, accessible and evidence-based resources and learning activities for health professionals Aim: To support the uptake of best practice cancer care by health professionals through providing accessible and evidence-based online learning and development resources. Strategy/Tactics: A national multi-phase project led by Cancer Australia and involving a collaboration of stakeholders in cancer care, has informed the development of an online hub, Cancer Learning. An iterative action based research approach has allowed for ongoing evaluation and improvements to Cancer Learning. Programme/Policy Process: Cancer Australia has supported Cancer Learning since its development in 2007. During 2013-2014, Cancer Learning was redeveloped through a rigorous process of user research to incorporate evidence based e-learning packages in priority areas of cancer care, including multidisciplinary care, supportive care and nursing education (including in specific tumour types). Resources are jointly developed with leading multidisciplinary experts in cancer care and delivered through dynamic online platforms. Outcomes/What was learned: Evaluations have been positive and site usage continues to grow, with over 2,600 registered users and over 4,500 unique users each month. Cancer Learning has achieved Health on the Net status, certifying the site's content as quality and reliable and has been endorsed by various Australian peak cancer care bodies. Collaborative partnerships have reduced duplication, standardised approaches and enhanced uptake of quality evidence-based learning and development. This national initiative highlights the important role that online initiatives can play in supporting the professional learning and development of all health professionals involved in cancer care, regardless of geographical location.

%X Introduction One can observe rapid changes in education and in particular education delivery over the past few years. This is being driven by information technology development, an expanding knowledge base and short product cycles amongst other things. All this adds an extra pressure to academia and higher education settings overall as reflecting and incorporating contemporary developments in the “traditional” curriculum does not happen as fast as one would expect. The same can be said about employers who face same difficulties when upgrading their employees‟ skills and knowledge in a timely, effective, and economical manner. Employees often find it difficult to interrupt their careers for further education; lifelong learners always seek for flexibility to accommodate their learning needs in relation to their personal circumstances. In response to these circumstances, the importance of distance learning, e-based learning, flexible learning etc., has risen. IT solutions and new learning technologies have enabled a wider choice of systems to deliver education in other ways than gathering students/learners in the same classroom or in the same physical space. Applications in Health Care Education We have performed a literature search using key words “e-learning”, “distance education”, “pharmacy”, “pharmacists”, “health care”, and “continuing professional development”. There is already a plethora of e-learning opportunities for pharmacy education (delivery and learning modalities), which vary between courses, modules, teaching tutorials, information resources to continuing professional development (1-7).We have looked at the applications of e-based learning in different healthcare related professions, such as medicine, radiology, nursing etc. Development of web-based and related emergent technologies has provided a valuable support for healthcare-related teaching and continuing professional education. In the case of Radiology (8-11), integration of different sources of information such as videos, images, text and sound has reduced barriers of paper-based teaching materials as modern diagnostic imagining increasingly uses digital images. E-based learning applications offer the bridge between education and training. These applications challenge the traditional model of education/training delivery and offer a new vision for established providers. Technology-enabled learning and knowledge can be effectively implemented into pharmacy practice and undergraduate education to support safe and effective performance of practitioners and improve learning outcomes of students. Technology is a cornerstone of e-based learning; however, the quality of these applications is more important than capabilities of the technology (12). Further research certainly needs to be done to find the best ways to deliver education in the context of available tools and concepts of educational thinking. We can conclude that existing technologies and ready-to-use tools are better in many cases, as developing a new software tool is a time and finance consuming activity which does not guarantee better quality. To look at existing and easy to manage solutions is a priority, rather than creating new and expensive tools. In this case the costs of e-based learning can be reduced. Running the literature search we have observed an increasing interest in the use of latest generation Web-based collaboration ware (Web 2.0 tools), such as wikis, blogs and podcasts in e-based learning applications. Growing numbers of publications in relation to application of these tools (13-24) in health care education is also observed. However, there is little published evidence about Web 2.0 tool applications in general pharmacy education or continued professional development of pharmacists. Increasing interest in Web 2.0 tools is in relation to features that enable information sharing and collaboration. In addition, they are relatively easy to use as one needs minimal technical skill, which allows more focus on information and collaborative tasks wit fe er delivery obstacles (25). In conclusion, the use of wikis, blogs and podcasts complement, improve and add collaboration possibilities to web-based medical/health education and continuing professional development. Wikis are used as information and knowledge source as the case of Wikipedia as well as it also enables collaboration in virtual interest groups working with the project or share the learning experience in virtual learning settings. There are already several successful health-related applications of wikis, such as Ganfyd, an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts (26), and Flu Wiki, which helps local public health communities to stay vigilant and prepared for possible influenza pandemics (25, 27). One of the more recent wiki applications is The Medpedia (28). This is a long term, worldwide project for sharing and advancing knowledge about health and medicine among medical professionals and the general public. It is developed in association with several well known medical schools and other leading global health organisations. Joint efforts - new ways A consortium has been formed between the European Pharmaceutical Students‟ Association (EPSA), European Self-Medication Industries (AESGP), European Association of Faculties of Pharmacy (EAFP), The London School of Pharmacy and Competency Development and Evaluation Group (CoDEG) (29) to conduct a pilot project „Self-medication Related Competencies for European Pharmacy Students and Pharmacists‟. The Project aims to develop a unique collaborative platform comprising knowledge and expertise together with self-assessment and learning resource for European pharmacy students and practitioners. Basic components 1. Creating, collecting and sharing knowledge and expertise resources from various faculties, organisations, institutions etc. Power point presentations, adobe flash applications, lecture material (audio, video, textbooks, etc.) that are embedded in media wiki. 2. Patient cases. Virtual patient counselling applications created by experts in core areas. Written in adobe flash. 3. European Developmental Framework. To communicate expected level of competence for foundation level of practice. A tool for self-assessment of one‟s competence and to operationalise CPD. 4. A pool of self-assessment questions related to learning outcomes and learning resources, which will link self-assessment of competence, knowledge and access to expertise. Written in adobe flash. Expectations This research will contribute to the development of a European Developmental Framework, based on a pilot validation exercise of the General Level Framework (GLF) (29) in a European practice context. The GLF supports the development of pharmacists as safe and effective general level practitioners. It is a backbone for the self-evaluation of students and practitioners. Other basic components are developed in parallel. An online knowledge and expertise resource is linked to the self-assessment, initially focusing on cardiovascular disease risk. There is an expectation to make continuing professional development for practitioners effective and structured and provide useful supporting tools. The project will provide a forum for individuals and groups to be recognised for their areas of expertise within topic-driven community of practice, and hence provide a useful context for wiki-driven Discussion Boards for emerging issues.

%X Introduction: The Irish National Dementia Strategy, published in December 2014, included “Better awareness and understanding” and “Training and education” as two of its six priority action areas. It was stated that the health services would engage with relevant professional and academic organisations to encourage and facilitate the provision of dementia-specific training, including continuous professional development, to relevant occupational and professional groups, including peer-led support and education for GPs, and to staff of nursing homes. The College of Psychiatrists of Ireland (CPsychI) is the responsible body in Ireland for postgraduate education and training in psychiatry and sought to develop appropriate educational initiatives to meet the targets described in the strategy and the wider needs for education in the area of psychogeriatrics. Methods: CPsychI engaged with other postgraduate medical training bodies including the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland to develop cost-effective educational initiatives aimed at multidisciplinary education and training. Results: E-modules were developed initially to address delirium and dementia with a later expansion to other areas of psychogeriatrics. It was possible to build on existing materials and to develop interactive materials in a number of formats with with built-in options for assessment. These were found to be both relevant and effective for multidisciplinary audiences. Conclusions: E-modules may be developed as a cost-effective methodology for education and training of multidisciplary healthcare workers in dementia care and related topics in psychogeriatrics. The presentation will demonstrate the range of materials developed, the built-in assessments, acceptability and relevance to healthcare workers from varied professional backgrounds.

%X Background: In May 2012, NHS Diabetes launched an Insulin Safety Resource Pack. The purpose of the campaign was to increase participation in the NHS Diabetes Safe Use of Insulin e-learning module amongst front-line hospital staff. Insulin Safety Resource Packs were posted to 164 acute trusts in England. Aims: The key aims of the evaluation were to gather feedback on (1) the initial impressions of the poster; (2) what the trust staff did with the poster and contents of the pack; (3) whether the poster or pack influenced people to join the e-learning module; (4) how the poster could be improved. Method: A 15-item online survey was developed and emailed to the 164 trusts. In addition, web statistics were obtained from NHS Diabetes and VirtualCollege, the course provider. Results: Data were received from 43 (26%) trusts. Respondents were diabetes specialist nurse (49%), senior diabetes specialist nurse (19%), lead diabetes specialist nurse (9%) and hospital consultants (16% ). Over 70% displayed the posters or cascaded the packs to other staff (61.5%). Ward and staff areas were the most common sites for posters to be displayed. Web statistics showed a steady increase in registrations and course completions since the launch of the Insulin Safety Resource Pack, from just under 51,000 completions in April 2012 to 62,000 in October 2012. Conclusions: Survey data suggest that the pack was well received. Respondents found the contents of the pack to be very relevant to their clinical work and patient safety, while the design of the poster was highly valued, being described as eye-catching, clear and attractive.

%X Numerous advances in technology during the past decade require that nurses not only be knowledgeable in nursing science but that they also become educated in information technology (IT). Perioperative IT has the potential to improve the quality of health care, reduce costs, decrease medication administration errors, reduce time spent on paperwork, increase management efficacy, and allow affordable access to health care. Nursing knowledge is needed for designing, implementing, and updating software, including an electronic health record (EHR). With the support of EHR data, nurses will be able to develop best practices for patient care and support research for evidence-based practice. When a standardized terminology, such as the Perioperative Nursing Data Set, is incorporated into an EHR, consistent documentation can be shared among systems. With advances in technology, perioperative nursing roles are expanding in relation to IT requirements and nurses are pursuing additional education. In addition to traditional methods, e-learning is an effective way to provide ongoing technological education. © 2010 AORN, Inc.

%X Introduction Despite advances in HRM and pH monitoring there is wide variation in technique and technology while reporting is often subjective and open to interpretation. This study assesses current practice around the world. Methods Through an on-line platform (Qualtrics LLC), a survey was distributed to unselected oesophageal units through international NGM societies. Questions explored infrastructure, technology, analysis and reporting. Results are presented as % of the total or mean±SD. Results 91 of 102 responses from 29 countries were analysable.( Table) 43 High (HVC) and 48 Low Volume Centres (LVC) were defined as more and less than 500 referrals/year. HVC employ more staff than LVC (p = 0.02) with more clinicians (3.0±1.0 vs. 2.6±1.2;p = 0.05), physiologists (1.6 ±1.1 vs. 2.0±1.3;p = 0.07) and nurses (3.3±1.2 vs. 2.4 ±1.1;p < 0.001). Most units (63/91;69%) stop medication. 18 (20%) use <12 sensor manometry, 75 (82%) >26 sensor HRM and 53 (58%) use HRM-Impedance (some had several systems). Adjunctive testing is increasingly incorporated.(Table) To define pathology, Chicago Classification is used in 65 (71%) units. 60% comment on the upper sphincter. In the presence of a hiatus hernia analysis of oesophago-gastric junction morphology varies widely (p=NS). 64% proceed with pH-monitoring despite ≥Grade B oesophagitis. If intolerant of the catheter, 45% refer for catheterfree monitoring and 16.5% for barium; 14% do nothing further. HVC are more likely to employ catheter-free systems than LVC (47% vs. 17%;p < 0.001). Of 86 (95%) units with Impedance-pH (Imp-pH), studies are performed on acid suppression in 54% with oesophagitis/ Barrett's. Overall, 8% perform all Imp-pH studies on therapy, 9% never do. Dietary modification (acid avoidance) is always recommended in 48%. Meals/snacks are not analysed in 91% units with standard pH and 84% with Imp-pH. Overall 17% do not exclude meals with either. 75% manually analyse every Imp-reflux event while 59% only target symptoms. For symptom-association, 30% units pool symptoms while 74% analyse each separately. Therapy advice is included in 49% HVC and 31% LVC (p = 0.044); 40% overall. [TABLE PRESENTED] Conclusion There is marked heterogeneity in methodology, interpretation and presentation of HRM and pH studies around the world. This survey sets the background from which agreement of standard operating procedures can begin.

%X The School of Health Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (SHS) is planning to expand its contribution to produce more graduate nurses by offering a nursing degree through e-learning. After three years of using e-learning by four lecturers in seven nursing courses, we conducted a study to get the lecturers feedback and to compare the students' preference and their actual experiences in e-learning. Lecturers' feedback were collected based on six open-ended questions. Feedback from all the 36 final year nursing students were collected using Constructivist On-line Learning Environment Survey (COLLES)--the Student Experience/Preferred Form. Results show that lecturers and students have positive perception on e-learning. They perceive e-learning as a powerful and effective tool for expanding nursing education to meet the demand for a labour force that is knowledgeable, highly skilled and equipped with positive values. We believe blended learning is the most suitable approach to implement e-learning and social constructivism theory provides the dynamic view of learning. To increase success in e-learning implementation for the nursing programme, lecturers should be educated regarding proper instructional design so that their content delivery blends well with the technology and pedagogy.

%X BACKGROUND: Keratoconus is a condition of the eye that affects approximately 1 in 2000 people. The disease leads to a gradual increase in corneal curvature and decrease in visual acuity with consequent impact on quality of life. Collagen cross-linking (CXL) with ultraviolet A (UVA) light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a relatively new treatment that has been reported to slow or halt the progression of the disease in its early stages. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence that CXL is an effective and safe treatment for halting the progression of keratoconus compared to no treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2014), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2014), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 August 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where CXL with UVA light and riboflavin was used to treat people with keratoconus and was compared to no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were two indicators of progression at 12 months: increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 dioptres (D) or more and deterioration in uncorrected visual acuity of more than 0.2 logMAR. MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs conducted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that enrolled a total of 225 eyes and analysed 219 eyes. The total number of people enrolled was not clear in two of the studies. Only adults were enrolled into these studies. Out of the eyes analysed, 119 had CXL (all using the epithelium-off technique) and 100 served as controls. One of these studies only reported comparative data on review outcomes. All three studies were at high risk for performance bias (lack of masking), detection bias (only one trial attempted to mask outcome assessment), and attrition bias (incomplete follow-up). It was not possible to pool data due to differences in measuring and reporting outcomes. We identified a further three unpublished trials that potentially had enrolled a total of 195 participants.There was limited evidence on the risk of progression. Analysis of the first few participants followed up to one year in one study suggested that eyes given CXL were less likely to have an increase in maximum keratometry of 1.5 D or more at 12 months compared to eyes given no treatment, but the confidence intervals (CI) were wide and compatible with no effect or more progression in the CXL group (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.00, 19 eyes). The same study reported the number of eyes with an increase of 2 D or more at 36 months in the whole cohort with a RR of 0.03 favouring CXL (95% CI 0.00 to 0.43, 94 eyes). Another study reported "progression" at 18 months using a different definition; people receiving CXL were less likely to progress, but again the effect was uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.61, 44 eyes). We judged this to be very low-quality evidence due to the risk of bias of included studies, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias but noted that the size of the potential effect was large.On average, treated eyes had a less steep cornea (approximately 2 D less steep) (mean difference (MD) -1.92, 95% CI -2.54 to -1.30, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low-quality evidence) and better uncorrected visual acuity (approximately 2 lines or 10 letters better) (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.09, 94 eyes, 1 RCT, very low-quality evidence) at 12 months. None of the studies reported loss of 0.2 logMAR acuity. The data on corneal thickness were inconsistent. There were no data available on quality of life or costs. Adverse effects were not uncommon but mostly transient and of low clinical significance. In one trial, 3 out of 12 participants treated with CXL had an adverse effect including corneal oedema, anterior chamber inflammation, and recurrent corneal erosions. In one trial at 3 years 3 out of 50 participants experienced adverse events including mild diffuse corneal oedema and paracentral infiltrate, peripheral corneal vascularisation, and subepithelial infiltrates and anterior chamber inflammation. No adverse effects were reported in the control groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the use of CXL in the management of keratoconus is limited due the lack of properly conducted RCTs.

%X Aims: The increasing number of academic medical departments and consecutively slowly increasing number of collaborating general practices require new methods when seeking for promising strategies to cooperate in research, teaching and continuing education. Methods: Therefore the University of Heidelberg, Department of General Practice and Health Sevices Research established a new event of continuing medical education on the campus integrating a number of major elements in order to offer a strong independent partner in research, teaching and CME to a large number of GPs in the region: the "Tag der Allgemeinmedizin" presents information to collaborating and teaching general practices on current research projects and teaching issues and also offers interactive workshops for all interested GPs, practice nurses and the whole practice team in an attractive non-sponsored environment enabling an exchange of experiences among colleagues. Topics such as treatment of chronic wounds, geriatric assessment and evidence based medicine or training modules in spirometric measurement often derive from quality circles. Mainly general practitioners act as instructors or moderators. Results: Evaluation of the first four events revealed high acceptance scores not only in high number of participants (N = 987) but also in good rating of the 80 workshops (average 1.8 on a 6 point - LIKERT scale). Conclusion: This makes a considerable effort worthwhile for the future: the bonding between general practices and university department increases; a win-win situation on both sides. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

%X Under the current nursing education system in Taiwan, a fair and objective evaluation of group health teaching competency has been lacking for a long time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish a competency-based group health teaching performance examination model for baccalaureate graduates. Action research was the main research methodology used in this study. The research consisted of two phases. In the first phase, a development committee was established. Based on routine discussions, literature reviews and realistic cases, a draft examination model with quasi-clinical situation model content and procedure was developed. Examination Facility Preparations, Simulated Scenarios and Client Recruitments, Examination Result Evaluation (evaluated by teachers) and Learning Guidelines were also prepared. This draft was reviewed twice for expert opinion, a pilot test was done and both the draft and pilot testing were reviewed again before the draft was finalized. The second phase involved refining the examination model by actually practicing the completed draft examination model in a simulated group-teaching setting in order to examine the model's reliability and validity. Fifteen people were involved in this experiment: three nursing personnel each having at least two years' clinical and teaching experience; three nursing students who did not have actual clinical experience and had not taken the course of teaching principles; three senior teachers; and six virtual patients. The responses from the nursing personnel, nursing students, teachers, and virtual patients who participated in the testing were gathered and integrated to refine the model. The model has content, expert and discriminative validity. The reliability of the model was proven by the high consistency in administration and scoring of the model by clinical examiners. This examination model is not only applicable for the proof of students' credit point exemption, but also as an alternative option for examining nursing personnel in traditional nursing education and practice.

%X This paper describes the development and evaluation of a critical care e-learning scenario for student nurses. At present, there are insufficient opportunities in the United Kingdom (UK) for student nurses to experience clinical placements where their skills in care of the critically-ill can be developed. There is therefore a need for new learning materials that help learners recognise the signs of clinical deterioration and rehearse the management of critically-ill patients. One way of meeting this need is by using electronic care scenarios. Several electronic care scenarios have been developed at Swansea University as part of the eWARD project. This article describes the design and evaluation of a critical care scenario that follows the care of a road casualty (John Macadam) after admission to an intensive care unit. The scenario was designed by an advisory team comprising a clinical lecturer and e-learning specialists. After using the scenario, 144 nursing students completed a Web-based questionnaire that collected demographic and attitudinal data for analysis using SPSS. Nursing students had a strongly positive attitude to the scenario with median scores in excess of 20 compared to maxima of 25 for scales measuring ease-of-use, interactivity, realism and confidence. None of the demographic data collected had a significant effect on these attitudes. The positive attitude of student nurses to this scenario strongly supports its use to help learners to (1) acquire knowledge and awareness when real life placements in these settings are not available and (2) extend their knowledge after coming across similar situations in practice.

%X Introduction.- Prevention of falls is an important health problem. Whole body vibration training of high intensity and low amplitude induces a gain in balance and muscle strength. The present study sought to examine whether such a whole body vibration training of low intensity and high amplitude, more adapted to frail persons, may reduce the incidence of falls in nursing homes. Methods.- One hundred and fifteen women and 39 men living in nursing homes (85.0±6.8 years) able to walk and with no contraindication to whole body vibration (WVB) were randomized into a group performing exercises on a vibrating platform (1.5 Hz to 2.4 Hz; amplitude: 30mm) or a group performing the same exercises on non-vibrating platform. Exercises consisted in squat movements with different stance widths and durations (3×30 s to 9×40 s), three times a week (20 minutes per session). Falls were recorded prospectively for the 6-month program. Results.- Subjects ofWBVgroup were followed for an average of 4.4 monthand 4.9 in the control group (P = 0.13). Subjects ofWBVgroup experienced 0.11 fall by month, comparatively to 0.17 in the control group (P = 0.38). The risk of falling was not significantly different between the WBV and the control groups (0.09 vs 0.12 faller by month, respectively) (P = 0.36). Conclusion.- A 6-month physical activity program using a low frequency and high amplitude vibrating platform does not reduce significantly neither the incidence of falls nor the risk of falling in frail older adults living in nursing homes, compared to the same program without any vibration.

%X OBJECTIVES: Replacement of Peripheral Venous Catheter (PVC) is sometimes required prematurely due to extravasation, catheter damage, complications such as phlebitis. We evaluated the clinical and economic benefits of an integrated closed intravenous catheter system (CICS) with pre-attached stabilization platform and extension tube (Catheter A) which may reduce the occurrence of unscheduled catheter replacement. METHODS: A prospective, open, quasi-random, and controlled study was conducted to compare Catheter A and a conventional PVC (Catheter B) in a 286-bed general hospital in Japan. Patients requiring PVCs for 72 hours or more were enrolled and assigned to either Catheter A Group (Group A) or Catheter B Group (Group B). Both catheters were secured with the same procedure and regularly observed until removal. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the replacement rates for both catheters for 72 hours was calculated, and the cost difference between the groups was obtained using product prices and average nursing fees published by the government. RESULTS: There were 358 patients evaluated: 193 in Group A and 165 in Group B. One hundred forty three patients in Group A and 109 patients in Group B required catheter replacement because of extravasation, catheter damage, complications, or scheduled catheter removal. The remaining 106 patients from both groups had catheters removed for unexpected reasons such as earlier end of therapy and self-withdrawal. Excluding those 106 patients, there was a significant difference in the catheter survival curves between Group A and B (p0.01, log-rank test). The total cost of catheter replacement for 72-hour use was 393 yen for Group A and 704 yen for Group B. CONCLUSIONS: The cost difference between two catheters can be offset by savings generated from a lower event rate. Along with total cost benefits, the use of CICS is considered to provide improved safety to patients through decreased complications.

%X Singapore General Hospital (SGH) pioneered e-learning systems in Singapore as a knowledge management initiative for nurses. This paradigm shift in nursing education is a proactive step taken to address the increasing sophistication of healthcare systems, expanding demand and perennial shortage of nursing talent. E-learning has been a success at SGH, through providing systematic sharing of knowledge and capture of experience, through both formal and informal online channels. It also made training more effective and less costly. Formal methods of knowledge sharing comprise online learning through interactive training modules and slides presentation with narration, while informal learning comprises of peer group discussion and journal review. Both elements have been essential in making e-learning a success and in creating a lifelong learning culture in SGH.

%X Project Description: The Danish ABC Dementia; new e-learning close knit to practice for professional caregivers. Background The Danish Dementia Research Centre has chosen to focus on the development of electronic forms of dissemination and learning materials.By using electronic media,we offer a new and different way to disseminate knowledge and provide training. We found that educational materials targeted dementia nurses, social and health assistants and other health care professionals are much needed. In particular, educational materials which could provide skills and tools, readily applicable for professional carers in their daily work.ABCDementia was developed as a web-based basic course for nursing and care staff. It consists of 10 modules with different themes: types of dementia, brain function, other conditions with similar symptoms, challenging behavior, care, communication, family caregivers, environmental issues, activities and legal issues. It offers new learning methods, such as letting the user visit a virtual nursing home with residents with different needs. In this environment the user can practice, reflect and get factual knowledge. Using video cases, the user can practice the best way of communicating. ABC Dementia translate evidence-based knowledge to best practice.It is practice-orientated and very user-friendly for the target groups, and it contains a variety of text, assignments, filmclips, cases, virtual environments. ABCDementia was launched in May 2013, it will regularly be supplemented with more modules and completed mid- 2014. Primo 2014 we had about 3000 user across the country. The electronic media offers flexibility as it can be accessed when needed. It motivates a many professional care staff members to learn more about dementia, and it is a good add-on to other ways of spreading knowledge and initiating the dialogue, which is needed in order to provide good care for people with dementia.

%X BACKGROUND: When cardiac arrest occurs, timely competent advanced life support (ALS) interventions by nursing staff can influence patient outcomes. Ongoing ALS education influences maintenance of competency and avoids skill decay. OBJECTIVES: To explore the methods of ALS education delivery for nurses in the workplace; describe the issues relating to maintaining ALS competency; explore ALS competency decay for nurses and develop recommendations for the provision of continuing ALS education. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory design was used to study ALS education provision in the workplace. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from ALS nurse experts in Western Australia by face-to-face and phone interviews. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted and organised around a set of predetermined questions. RESULTS: Two major themes were identified; the first theme Demand and Supply describes the increasing demand for ALS education for nurses and the challenges with providing timely cost effective traditional face-to-face ALS education. The second theme, Choosing The Best Education Options describes new ways to provide ALS education using emerging technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that using e-learning methods would assist with educating the maximum amount of nurses in a timely manner and e-learning and teleconferencing offer opportunities to reach nurses in distant locations. Delivering ALS education more frequently than annually would increase skills maintenance and lessen skill decay. Further research is required to explore which blended e-learning model is best suited to ALS education.

%X The author investigated attitudes of nursing students enrolled in e-Learning towards academic dishonesty. The descriptive-exploratory design was used in the conduct of the study. Respondents were randomly selected 36 junior and senior nursing students. It revealed that nursing students perceived as neutral (mean = 2.77, mean = 3.17) in taking responsibility for promoting academic integrity in e-learning. The paraphrasing a sentence from internet source without referencing it (38.89%) got the most form of cheating. Female and level four (4) nursing students revealed as the most cheaters. The reasons not to cheat, nursing students considered punishment, and education or learning (91.67%) got the highest in ranks, and simply wrong (75%) got the lowest rank. Hence, there is a need to look on how to maintain academic honesty among nursing students in and out of the university with respect to e-learning as a means of teaching-learning method.

%X Introduction: Design research methodology was developed for iteratively creating, reviewing and improving engineering designs. This approach is used in educational research to improve teaching interventions. Design experiments involve inter-professional teams of practitioners, and researchers, with researchers operating as participants (Collins et al., 2004). The approach has rarely been used in evaluating clinical education. Using a design experiment we evaluated the creation of a novel, online, problem-based learning (Hartling et al., 2010) resource for enhancing consultation skills. The resource accommodates personal experience and values, develops self-reflection, and draws on best evidence. Methods: A small scale participatory design research evaluation has enabled us to explore: • How an interprofessional team (comprising staff from 3 institutions, representing GPs, nurses and pharmacists, a patient participant and an educationalist) work together to iteratively design an online resource for enhancing prescribing practice. • Inputs, resources and design process required for creating this resource. Results and Discussion: The act of co-construction for educational design mirrors working in practice and foregrounds questions about participants’ differing professional histories, paradigms, pedagogies and contexts. Designing learning for different professional groups and varied career stages is challenging but achievable through drawing on experiences of team members. Design experiments provide an alternative means to evaluate experiences and outputs of learning activities.

%X Introduction Assessment of challenging behaviors in dementia is important for intervention selection. Here, we describe the technical and experimental setup and the feasibility of long-term multidimensional behavior assessment of people with dementia living in nursing homes. Methods We conducted 4 weeks of multimodal sensor assessment together with real-time observation of 17 residents with moderate to very severe dementia in two nursing care units. Nursing staff received extensive training on device handling and measurement procedures. Behavior of a subsample of eight participants was further recorded by videotaping during 4 weeks during day hours. Sensors were mounted on the participants' wrist and ankle and measured motion, rotation, as well as surrounding loudness level, light level, and air pressure. Results Participants were in moderate to severe stages of dementia. Almost 100% of participants exhibited relevant levels of challenging behaviors. Automated quality control detected 155 potential issues. But only 11% of the recordings have been influenced by noncompliance of the participants. Qualitative debriefing of staff members suggested that implementation of the technology and observation platform in the routine procedures of the nursing home units was feasible and identified a range of user- and hardware-related implementation and handling challenges. Discussion Our results indicate that high-quality behavior data from real-world environments can be made available for the development of intelligent assistive systems and that the problem of noncompliance seems to be manageable. Currently, we train machine-learning algorithms to detect episodes of challenging behaviors in the recorded sensor data.

To assure high-yield of data from busy clinicians, the design objectives included low response burden, the ability to collect complex real-time data in dynamic work environments, and automated data integration. Iterative user-centered design of custom interfaces resulted in a dynamic intuitive platform where branching logic was applied to present a series of survey questions dependent on the participant's responses. Over a 12-month period, 304 inpatient physicians and nurses completed (with minimal initial training) a total of 11,381 survey responses.

%X Radiation science is a highly visual field that is constantly evolving due to technological advances. Technology has significantly improved almost all aspects of the field over the past 10-15 years. These advances in technology have also played a significant role in the education of radiation science students didactically and clinically. The enormous increase in the capabilities of information technology provides the opportunity for educators to dramatically change their way of teaching (Martino, 2008). mLearning or mobile learning involves the use of mobile devices (i.e. personal digital assistants, smart phones, iPhones, iTouch, iPad, laptops and tablets) to enhance teaching and learning. The most significant advantage of mLearning is the mobility of the technology which allows for unlimited, immediate and continuous access to course materials. Research on the use of mobile devices has been done in fields such as medicine and nursing; however, there is little research in the field of radiation science. More research is needed to determine how these devices can be used as an instructional aid and competency assessment tool for radiation science students (Applegate, 2010). Faculty members at two radiation science education programs are currently exploring and researching how this type of technology can be used to improve the education of radiation science students, in the classroom, laboratory, and clinical setting. This poster presentation will outline the initial findings of this research.

%X AIM: To discuss the actual public image of nurses and other factors that influence the development of nurses' self-concept and professional identity. BACKGROUND: Nurses have become healthcare professionals in their own right who possess a great deal of knowledge. However, the public does not always value the skills and competences nurses have acquired through education and innovation. DESIGN: Discussion paper. DATA SOURCES: We identified 1216 relevant studies by searching MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases in the period 1997-2010. Finally, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The included studies show that the actual public image of nursing is diverse and incongruous. This image is partly self-created by nurses due to their invisibility and their lack of public discourse. Nurses derive their self-concept and professional identity from their public image, work environment, work values, education and traditional social and cultural values. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should work harder to communicate their professionalism to the public. Social media like the Internet and YouTube can be used to show the public what they really do. CONCLUSION: To improve their public image and to obtain a stronger position in healthcare organizations, nurses need to increase their visibility. This could be realized by ongoing education and a challenging work environment that encourages nurses to stand up for themselves. Furthermore, nurses should make better use of strategic positions, such as case manager, nurse educator or clinical nurse specialist and use their professionalism to show the public what their work really entails.

%X Purpose: The investigate and identify the problems new nursing staffs may encounter to during their first year in clinical care. Special emphasis has been placed on the degree of emotional impact on the new staffs and various kinds of aid that may be provided by the hospital authorities. At the end of the study, we would draw the conclusion to improve the quality of patient care and safety. In addition, we also proposed solutions to lower the high resignation rate of first-year nursing staffs. Materials and methods: Six first-year new nursing staffs from an urological ward of a medical center located in northern Taiwan participated in this study. The structured questionnaires focus on the efficacy of the current training program provided by the hospital and self-assessment on their clinical skills. All of the questionnaires returned.(n=6). The results were processed and analyzed according to decision - matrix method. Based on the results, new clinical care guidelines and teaching strategies were established and recorded as video files which could be easily accessed via the hospital on-line intranet learning program, “e-learning”. Results: On the issue of difficulties encountered in learning, 83.3% of new nurses noted that the current teaching method was insufficient to meet the practical demands. Fifty percent of new nurses encountered difficulties even after they have consulted senior staffs. Sixty-six point six percent of new nurses still faced problems in the memorization of daily nursing protocols, even when they have performed them before. Thirty-three point three percent of new nurses were timid in seeking help from senior members. Eighty- three point three percent of new nurses were frustrated by the inconsistencies between instructions of the different senior teaching staffs. Most distress came from career disappointment, followed by the attitude and inconsistency between different instructing staffs. After the execution of the “e-learning” program, 100% of senior staffs (n=5) expressed increased willingness to guide new nurses. Eighty percent of senior staffs appreciated the consistency of the teaching material. All new nurses (n=6) were satisfied with the consistency of the teaching programs and the fact thatspecific relevant materials can be repeated as frequently as needed. All new nurses expressed the willingness to remain in position after the execution of the “e-learning” program.Conclusion: On-line e-learning program is an easy way to provide up-to-date training. It can significantly lower the cost of training in comparison with the traditional lecture-based method. Due to its accessibility and ease of modification, on-line teaching program is widely utilized in higher education institutes. We can use it to provide the most up-to-date training for new clinical nursing staffs in order to improve patient safety, clinical care quality, and also job satisfaction.

%X Leveraging on staff's familiarity with the global Internet and the Hospital Information Technology infrastructure, nurses at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) first took the challenge to design and develop an in-house intranet, which serves as a communication network in 1997. This nursing intranet was further enhanced using multi-media technology to develop e-learning modules on nursing specialty, skill-based, and audio slides presentation training. In addition, it also serves as a repository for policies, operational, nursing procedure documents and catalogue of forms, patient instruction pamphlets. Nurses can easily print all these forms and teaching brochures on-line. The nursing intranet offers cost-effective solution for distributing information through virtual network and accessible from over 700 points in SGH, 6 other affiliated medical institutions, and from nurses' homes too.

%X Behavioral problems are prevalent among persons withADand significantly impair their health, well-being, and quality of life; our ability to provide effective care; and the life of their caregivers. Despite this, effective pharmacological treatments are of questionable utility. Indeed, experts and guidelines from various professional associations agree that medications are “the last resort” and nonpharmacological strategies should be implemented first. This keynote will provide an overview on the state-of-the-science for nonpharmacological treatment of persons with AD and their caregivers. Despite major advances in recent years, the rate of knowledge acquisition and dissemination is seriously hindered by ever dwindling funds on both national and international levels. Recent findings from the Seattle Protocols, a series of systematic randomized controlled clinical trials designed to reduce behavioral problems in persons with Alzheimer's disease via education, support and skill-training of their caregivers, will be discussed. The goal of these studies is to establish conceptually sound and clinically relevant treatment approaches and to evaluate their effectiveness along the diverse continuum of environments in which older adults reside and receive care (e.g., private homes, retirement communities, assisted-living residences, adult family homes, and skilled nursing facilities). Translated in over a dozen languages, employed in countries around the world, and states across the U.S., it is hoped that these programs offer a solid platform for advancing our knowledge of how best to improve the care of those suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and helping those dedicated to providing that care.

%X Background A standardised electronic paediatric drug database was needed in order to aid paediatric drug dose selection within both prescribing and clinical pharmacist screening. Purpose To determine a system of information inputs and checks to support the development of an electronic paediatric drug database (DD). The DD is designed as a clinical support tool to aid paediatric drug dose selection within both prescribing and clinical pharmacist screening. Material and methods A multi-disciplinary team was appointed that included senior and junior medical staff, senior and junior pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, data analyst/database engineer, nursing staff and project manager. The DD was built in MS Access 2007. Information arbitration is provided by a senior oversight team consisting of the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Chair of Drugs and Therapeutics Committee and Director of the Academic Practice Unit (a clinical pharmacist). Results Common data sources used in clinical practice were identified as suitable for information harvesting. The DD system is based on 5 core data fields: Drug, Indication, Route, Age, and Dose; known as DIRAD. Each DIRAD is unique with processes in place to ensure they are not duplicated. Input of a draft DIRAD occurs at level 1 (L1), which is the lowest level in the 5 level process. Passage through the system to final approval at L5 requires acceptance of the DIRAD at each and every level in the process. To date (July 2014) over 3,000 DIRADs have been entered into the system representing 765 drug entities. Reference to relevant dm + d codes is allowed within the DD structure. Migration of the system to a Sequel Server (SQL) platform is planned. Conclusion The developed 5 stage process has been successfully used to capture and validate clinical information suitable to support electronic prescribing of medicines for paediatrics.

%X Service user involvement is an important part of pre-registration nursing programmes, as it can give students the opportunity to learn from users about their experiences of health and illness, but so far there have been limited studies in this area. • This literature review provides an opportunity to explore how service user involvement in classroom settings can impact on student learning, and describes methods of best practice. • Further research is needed to understand the influence of service user involvement on student nurses' clinical practice. Service user involvement in pre-registration nurse education is now a requirement, yet little is known about how students engage with users in the classroom, how such initiatives are being evaluated, how service users are prepared themselves to teach students, or the potential influence on clinical practice. The aim of this literature review was to bring together published articles on service user involvement in classroom settings in pre-registration mental health nurse education programmes, including their evaluations. A comprehensive review of the literature was carried out via computer search engines and the Internet, as well as a hand search of pertinent journals and references. This produced eight papers that fitted the inclusion criteria, comprising four empirical studies and four review articles, which were then reviewed using a seven-item checklist. The articles revealed a range of teaching and learning strategies had been employed, ranging from exposure to users' personal stories, to students being required to demonstrate awareness of user perspectives in case study presentations, with others involving eLearning and assessment skills initiatives. This review concludes that further longitudinal research is needed to establish the influence of user involvement in the classroom over time. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing.

%X BACKGROUND: Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI) specialists provide genetic evaluation for patients with various reproductive disorders. With the rapid evolution of new genomic technologies, clinical genetic training in REI fellowship programs need to be evaluated to provide guidance for meeting the public health requirements for competent health professionals in the specialty. OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed the current status of genetics training for REI fellows by evaluating trends in utilization of genomic technologies and genetic training in fellowship training programs in the United States. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using an anonymous online survey instrument, REI fellowship program directors were queried regarding familiarity with genomic technologies, utilization of genetic techniques, genetics training experience for REI fellows and perceived utility of more genetic training for the fellows. The respondents had the option of skipping question. Responses were accepted between May and November 2016. RESULTS: Surveys were distributed via e-mail to 40 program directors. Of these, 35 were available (5 had blocked email access to the online survey instrument). Fourteen of the available program directors (40%; 14/35) responded with reported experience of <5 to >20 years in the role. One program director was board certified in both REI and genetics, 4/13 (31%) reported having a board certified geneticist and 5/13 (38%) reported having a dedicated genetic counselor as part of the fellowship program. All but one respondent (13/14; 93%) reported familiarity with Next Gen sequencing. The utilization of genetic techniques for expanded carrier screen varied: genotyping (3/12; 25%), targeted sequencing (4/12; 33%), whole exome sequencing (3/12; 25%). 2/ 12 (17%) were not sure about the technique used. Expanded carrier screen was not offered at one program. The most important characteristic dictating selection of carrier screening product was cost to the patient (7/14; 50%), followed by methodology/ rigor of testing (3/14; 21%), clinical support/ease of ordering (2/14; 14%) and reputation of company (1/14; 7%). For preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), 85% (11/13) utilized Next Gen sequencing and the rest 2/13 (15%) reported using chromosomal microarray. Methodology/ rigor of testing (6/ 13; 46%), reputation of company (4/13; 31%), clinical support/ease of ordering (2/13; 15%) and cost to the patient (1/13; 8%) were reported as the deciding factors for choosing the PGS laboratory. Majority reported that genetic testing results were given out by attending physicians (10/13; 77%) followed by nurses (2/13; 15%) and embryologists (1/12; 8%). Fellows were not involved in giving the initial genetic results to patients at any program. Most either strongly agreed (10/14, 71%) or agreed (4/14; 29%) that knowledge of genetics is essential for a practicing REI. All programs reported that their fellows received formal didactics in genetics. While 7/14 (50%) had a formal genetics rotation, only 2/14 (14%) reported that their fellows rotated through a PGS laboratory. Respondents' narrative comments reflected the perception of the program directors for increased genetic training for the fellows. CONCLUSION: These initial findings should serve as a platform for further discussion regarding the optimal genetics education and clinical experience for a REI fellow required to meet regional and national needs for an accessible and proficient work force.

%X Introduction and Objectives: J ournal clubs have long been recognised as a method of teaching, analysing and discussing current research and its impact on clinical practice. Participation is variable due to various logistical concerns. There are reports of online journal clubs catering to local medical, nursing and allied health groups. Our aim was to assess whether an online international urology journal club via Twitter, a social media micro-blogging platform, is feasible. To our knowledge this is the first of its kind. Methods : Th is pilot project was conducted on Twitter in November, 2012 with the hashtag '#urojc'. The journal club and article for discussion were advertised on Twitter five days prior to commencement. The first and corresponding authors of the selected article for discussion accepted the invitation to participate. An asynchronous discussion was conducted over 48 hours to accommodate international participants. International Urology Journal Club (Twitter handle @iurojc) moderated the discussion. The discussion was open rather than a structured question answer format. Results : T witter metric analysis was undertaken with the assistance of 'Symplur, LLC' and 'tweetreach'. A total of 45 contributors from 10 countries participated in the journal club discussion. Participants included urologists, trainees, students, healthcare organisations and members of the public. The number of Twitter accounts reached totalled 8,078 with 58,566 impressions. A total of 243 tweets were sent during the discussion period, with 172 original tweets and 71 re-tweets. Refer to figure for number of tweets per day. C onclusion: The large number of international participants provides evidence of significant interest in this social media format for journal article discussion. The International Urology Journal club (IUroJC) has the potential to assemble leading urologists, authors and other stakeholders in an online environment and facilitate cutting edge discussion. We believe IUroJC is feasible and further work in this area is justified.

%X Background. We evaluated the capacity of biomechanical and clinical measures of balance to predict future risk of recurrent falls in a cohort of frail, elderly ambulatory residents of 12 Tennessee community nursing homes. Methods. Baseline measurements of balance and other potential fall risk factors were obtained in 303 ambulatory nursing home residents. Balance measures included biomechanics force platform measurements of postural sway (area ellipse and mean velocity) and clinical measures, which included functional reach, Tinetti balance subscale (adapted from Tinetti's Performance Oriented Mobility Index), timed chair stands, and 10-foot walk. Residents who fell two or more times during follow-up (mean of 11 months) were identified from nursing home incident reports and nursing notes. The predictive value of the balance measures was evaluated by the incidence density ratio (IDR) estimated from proportional hazards models. Results. There were 118 recurrent fallers (54.2 per 100 person-years). Rates of recurrent falls increased with increasing quintiles of both the biomechanical and clinical measures of balance, with unadjusted IDRs (95% CI) per quintile change of 1.22 (1.07-1.39) for area ellipse, 1.12 (0.98-1.27) for mean velocity of postural sway, 1.29 (1.13-1.47) for the Tinetti balance subscale, 1.24 (1.08-1.41) for timed walk, 1.24 (1.09-1.42) for timed chair stands, and 1.12 (0.98-1.28) for functional reach. Controlling for age, gender, height, and weight did not materially affect the linear relationship between the balance measure quintiles and subsequent recurrent falls. However, after controlling for additional fall risk factors, only area ellipse of postural sway and the Tinetti balance subscale remained independently predictive of subsequent recurrent fall rates, with IDRs of 1.16 (1.02-1.36) and 1.17 (1.01-1.34), respectively. In an analysis where subjects were stratified by tertiles of each of these two measures, each measure appeared to independently predict future rates of recurrent falls. The independent predictive capacity of each measure persisted after controlling for other fall risk factors in a multivariate analysis with IDRs of 1.15 (1.00-1.32) for area ellipse and 1.15 (1.00-1.32) for the Tinetti balance subscale. Inclusion of both balance measures in a model with other fall risk factors to evaluate their relationship did not materially alter IDR point estimates of these risk factors. Conclusions. In this cohort of frail, nursing home residents, both area ellipse of postural sway and the Tinetti balance subscale independently predicted risk of future recurrent falls. However, the predictive value of other independent fall risk factors on risk of future recurrent falls persisted and was not explained by these two measures. Thus, assessment of patient fall risk based on surrogate endpoints, for either research or clinical practice, may need to include multiple measurements.

%X Study Objectives: Staff that participates in adverse event review feel valuable clinical pearls can be gained from the process. We sought to create a Web-based intervention, called “Lessons Learned,” to share these pearls with all providers and nurses in our ED. Our monthly module would test clinical knowledge, teach through de-identified but actual adverse event case events, test short- and long-term retention of these clinical pearls, and measure whether or not participants are using this information in their clinical care. Methods: All nurses (163), emergency medicine residents (25), advanced practice providers (8), and board certified physicians (45) in a tertiary care academic emergency department (ED) with 73,000 annual visits were invited to participate in our Lessons Learned. Our pre-existing adverse event review process utilizes provider peer review and/or multidisciplinary review of cases with unanticipated outcomes. Leaders of our adverse event review process identified cases that were suitable for sharing with the entire department. Monthly, the Lessons Learned team emailed staff a link to a Web based module that included: two pre-test medical knowledge questions, two case vignettes with education, and two post-test questions, designed to test short-term acquisition of the clinical knowledge. Starting on month three, we included a retention and utilization section where we asked the two questions initially posed eight weeks earlier (testing longer-term acquisition) and whether the clinical pearls have been considered in bedside care. Education literature describes a progression through levels of learning. This process allows us to assess these levels of learning from knowledge acquisition to retention to analysis with incorporation into clinical practice. Results: Our voluntary modules averaged a response rate of 46% (n=112) of the 242 eligible staff receiving the email invitation to participate. In this pilot phase, four modules have been disseminated, and the first two have been tested for remote recall eight weeks after initial dissemination. These two modules demonstrated short- and long- term learning (“knowledge” and “retention”), and demonstrate application of the clinical pearls in bedside care (“application” and “synthesis”) (Figure). Conclusion: A Web-based format with short, concise case-based modules provides a platform for a large, diverse group of providers to glean clinical pearls from adverse event review. Analysis of provider groups can identify learning gaps related to these lessons learned to inform future quality and education initiatives related to patient care. (Figure Presented).

%X Relevance: Physiotalk is an online community with a stated aim of using social media to support physiotherapists professional development. Purpose: Physiotalk was launched in 2013, influenced by other tweetchat communities for nursing staff and occupational therapists. Its main purpose is to help physiotherapists learn, share, influence, and improve services for patients and communities, through fortnightly tweet chats and related blogs. Its objectives are to: - facilitate discussion about physiotherapy education, evidence and practice - support the sharing and adoption of good practice - demonstrate howsocial media can support quality improvement and CPD. Approach/evaluation: Physiotalk's main digital presence is the Twitter account @physiotalk, supported by the website physiotalk.co.uk and a Facebook page. Tweetchats are hosted by the Physiotalk team or guest hosts using a pre-agreed hashtag. Each chat has structured pre-chat information posted to the website and promoted via social media. A transcript of each tweetchat is added afterwards and provides a record for future reference. Chats cover a diverse range of areas including clinical, service and professional development topics. Physiotalk has required minimal financial investment; the community is run by 3 UK-based physiotherapists in their spare time, and without ongoing funding. After 2 years, an evaluation of the reach of Physiotalk was carried out using 4 existing analytical tools including Symplur and Tweepsmap to provide descriptive statistics and analyse key metrics for the Twitter account, tweetchats and website. Outcomes: In February 2016 @Physiotalk had 12,592 followers from 113 countries with an average growth of 557 followers a month during 2015. There have been 61 tweetchats over 2 years, an average of 46 people have taken part per tweetchat, ranging between 20 and 99. #physiotalk has been used on twitter by 4900 people in over 38,500 tweets, gaining over 68 million tweet impressions. The website has been accessed over 56,000 times from 136 different countries. Discussion and conclusions: Physiotalk has created a significant digital community and achieved global reach despite being self-organised and without funding. The tweetchats have provided opportunities for physiotherapists, healthcare professionals and members of the public to discuss areas of practice across geographical and hierarchical boundaries. This initial review has identified 2 areas for development: 1. Active participation in chats by non-UK based participants - this may be due to time zone issues during a live chat as well as a '.co.uk' website. 2. Proportion of followers who have not joined a tweetchat: the phenomenon of 'lurking' is well known on Twitter. Followers may watch the tweetchat in real time, or view the transcript afterwards, but do not actively participate. This may lead to underestimation of the reach of Physiotalk as these individuals are not represented in chat analytics. The second stage of evaluation is ongoing, focussing on determining the impact of engaging with Physiotalk on individual practice, service development and patient care. Impact and implications: Healthcare faces significant challenges in adopting evidence-based practice and innovation at pace and scale. Social media networks such as Physiotalk enable physiotherapists to share resources, experience and good practice with unprecedented speed, reach and accessibility.

%X Background: Vaginal agenesis occurs in 1 out of every 4,000-10,000 females. The most common cause is congenital absence of the uterus and vagina (also referred to as mullerian aplasia, mullerian agenesis, or MRKH syndrome). Most adolescents select vaginal dilation using dilators or surgery to create a neovagina; however, some teens elect not to create a vagina or to delay treatment. The psychological implications of MRKH can be profound, thus education and support are essential as part of a comprehensive MRKH program. Our team developed the idea of offering a conference based on requests from teen participants in our moderated online MRKH chat. Methods: We polled patients and their parents regarding their interest in attending a conference that would provide both up-to-date information and support, and their response was overwhelmingly positive. Our goals were to create a conference designed specifically for teen girls diagnosed with MRKH and their families, develop and distribute engaging, understandable health guides, and provide participants with an opportunity to meet other teens and their families in a safe and supportive environment. We developed an evaluation tool to collect feedback from conference participants in order to improve future conferences. This abstract focuses on data from a series of 6 MRKH conferences held annually, starting in 2006. The MRKH conference is open to the public and held at a large pediatric institution. An average of 40 participants attend each year, from 6 countries and 23 US states to date. The program includes a medical presentation on MRKH and support groups for teens, parents, and family members led by clinical nurse specialists and a clinical social worker. The day concludes with a health team panel that summarizes the presentation and provides an opportunity for participants to ask questions. We also host a live webcast of the presentation for those unable to attend. Each participant receives a packet including our MRKH health guides for teens and parents, which are also accessible via our website. The teen MRKH guide has received 24,082 unique page views on the site since 2008, and the parent MRKH guide has received 12,003. Participants are asked to complete an evaluation to assess their overall satisfaction with the conference. Findings are entered into a database and reviewed by the conference planning committee, with the goal of improving future conferences. Over the past 6 years, 88% of respondents indicated that they benefited from support groups, thus illustrating that both teens and their families desire the opportunity to meet others who share an MRKH diagnosis. Conclusion: In addition to providing a comprehensive, multidisciplinary MRKH program with medical care, nursing care, and clinical social work intervention, we found that patients and families greatly benefited from an annual conference. Participants appreciated the dual approach of health information and support. The framework can be a model for other hospitals and practices that provide comprehensive and holistic treatment for patients diagnosed with MRKH.

%X Objectives: Following the National Review of Mental Health Nursing in Scotland (2006), an action plan was developed to improve recovery focused mental health services. It was advocated that a method of sharing evidence based, positive and innovative practice in mental health be created. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland supported by the Scottish Government, was tasked to develop the database and successfully launched the PIRAMHIDS resource in September 2008, now providing the platform to share information at local, national and international levels. Methods: PIRAMHIDS ensures equitable opportunity to share examples of practice from statutory, non statutory services and the voluntary sector. Contribution to the database is made easy by an intuitive online submission process. A quality assurance process is then followed in achieving publication approval. Submissions are passed to an external review body. External reviewers consist of professionals from a range of disciplines including Psychiatry, Mental Health Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Higher Education, service improvement, etc. The selected reviewers consider the submission in context of the publication criteria which includes: Practice summary: Detail of practice deliverable Evidence base-current/existing or potential to inform evidence Challenges and resolves Quality assurance considerations and impact assessment on the patient experience Results/conclusions: PIRAMHIDS is the resource to share your practice. In addition there is an online forum encouraging networking, up to date mental health information feeds and direct links to other useful resources such as Integrated Care Pathways for mental health toolkit. Now accessed by thousands world wide, 'take the credit and share your care. Contribute today.

%X Background: Major goals in advanced NSCLC include accurate evaluation of survival and quality of life. Few trials evaluate both of these major endpoints well. In many studies, only a minority of patients have quality of life and other patient reported outcomes (PROs) such as symptoms systematically followed over time, which decreases the value of the assessment of the treatment. Prior studies have identified barriers to measuring quality of life in clinical trials and in practice. To overcome these barriers, we used a computer- assisted version of the validated LCSS measure and tested this prospectively in a large study in patients with Stage IV and IIIB NSCLC. The eLCSS-QL requires only two minutes for completion of the patient version and proved to be highly acceptable in earlier studies (Hollen, Supp Care Cancer 2012). Methods: This trial was conducted at 65 sites in 9 Asian countries. 622 patients received first-line treatment with docetaxel -based chemotherapy. Patient demographics included: 70% male; 65% adenocarcinoma; median: KPS = 90; ECOG = 1 (27% ECOG 0). Stages: IV (72%), IIIB (28%). 84% had two or more major symptoms. 80% received combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (52%) or carboplatin (28%). The eLCSS-QL was completed every 3 weeks at the clinic. We also surveyed 98 physicians and nurses treating these patients regarding their experiences concerning communication, usefulness and acceptability of the eLCSS-QL. Results: Ninety-seven percent of patients completed the eLCSSQL at baseline; 90% completed follow-up evaluations. Over 90% found the eLCSS-QL easy to use and acceptable to complete at each visit. More than 80% of patients reported increased awareness of symptoms and that the quality of life evaluation made it easier to speak with doctors and nurses. 1% refused eLCSS-QL completion. Of physicians and nurses, more than 90% found the eLCSS-QL easy to use and increased symptom awareness; 80% reported improved communication, enhanced satisfaction with the patient visit, and would recommend its use to others. Nearly 90% of physicians reported they could identify benefit from chemotherapy earlier; 76% would order fewer imaging tests and 80% said the eLCSS-QL could save time. Cross-cultural testing was performed in this 9 nation trial. Cronbach's alpha scores were high for each country, and exceeded 0.85 overall, demonstrating good cross-cultural reliability. Treatment outcomes: major response rate 37%; median survivals: 13.9 months (docetaxel + cisplatin), 12.7 months (docetaxel + carboplatin). Conclusion: Placing the well validated LCSS onto an electronic platform (eLCSS-QL) helped overcome barriers to evaluating QL in this large clinical trial, with 90% of patients completing baseline and repeated QL measures. Patients, physicians, and nurses all found the eLCSS-QL to be highly acceptable and easy to use. The good cross-cultural aspects of the eLCSS-QL indicate that the electronic platform is particularly suitable for multinational trials. This large prospective trial demonstrates that improved compliance with quality of life and PRO evaluation is feasible and can easily be accomplished in large clinical trials. Additionally, the electronic format enhances the potential for the use of PROs in decision making in clinical practice.

%X Introduction: There are almost 300,000 people living in care homes in the UK1, of which 27% are estimated to have diabetes2. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of care received by care home residents within the West Hampshire area. Methods: We designed a questionnaire based on those used by the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit (NaDIA). Nursing staff visited 2 care homes, in which 10 residents with diabetes were randomly selected to be audited. Results: All 10 of the residents audited had dementia coexisting alongside their diabetes, therefore it was not possible to complete the planned patient experience questionnaires. Both care homes audited had a policy for self-management of diabetes, however only 4 (40%) residents had had their suitability for self-management assessed. 4 (40%) residents had a documented lower blood glucose target, but none had an upper target. Of 51 care staff working in the homes, just 6 (12%) had formal diabetes training. Neither care home regularly updated staff diabetes training. Conclusion: Our data show a lack of awareness of available diabetes training within care homes, which could have a negative impact on patient care. Comorbidities such as dementia create additional challenges to the management of diabetes. We have identified a cost neutral approach, in the form of an awareness campaign we have called “Glucoheroes”. Staff can sign up to an email newsletter with signposting to education events and e-learning, to improve safety and knowledge.

%X Introduction Colorectal and stoma care nurses have been auditing their specialist services for years, but have contributed less frequently to colorectal surgical service-wide audit measuring clinical outcomes relating to surgical as well as nursing care. Nurse-led follow-up provides the ideal platform to measure key indicators of quality care and identify areas for both service improvement and future research activity. Method A nurse-led follow-up clinic at 30 days following patient discharge was used to audit 142 consecutive patients undergoing elective (n = 98) or emergency (n = 44) colorectal resection over a three month period. Audit data were recorded at two time-points, discharge from hospital and at clinic, with audit templates developed using validated tools designed to measure general post-operative morbidity1,2 and modified to include a focus on colorectal surgery-specific complications. Audit templates were tested during two clinics prior to full data collection to ensure they included all required variables. Results A wide range of anticipated and unanticipated findings were identified relating to both inpatient and early post-discharge morbidity. Findings were presented to the whole colorectal team, including upper GI and colorectal surgeons and their teams, specialist nurses, theatre-based and ward-based nursing staff. Areas of clinical practice identified by the audit as requiring improvement were identified and discussed, with immediate changes to surgical practice agreed by the whole team. Nurse-led follow-up for all colorectal patients was established as a potential goal for future service improvement. Conclusion This nurse-led audit enabled the whole colorectal team to scrutinise their clinical practice by comprehensively examining patient outcomes at two time-points following colorectal resection. Nurse-led follow-up using an auditable documentation template facilitates the recognition and reporting of a wide range of post-operative complications and provides valuable support for patients, particularly those who do not have routine access to specialist nursing services.

%X Nursing history was a core component of nurse training programs as early as 1907, when American Adelaide Nutting published her three-volume history. However, it had all but disappeared by the end of the 20th century, supplanted by other subjects. The University of Ottawa Nursing History Research Unit developed two online nursing history courses, in English and French, respectively, which proved popular and prompted substantial interest in the reintroduction of nursing history to our curriculum. This article presents findings of a study that examined the concept of "historical thinking" - what it is, how it develops, and what it contributes to practice-based professions - based on student postings in these courses. Analysis suggests that primary sources and critical appraisal skills are keys to the formation of historical thinking, and that these courses fostered a strong sense of professional identity among participants who often lamented lack of previous exposure to nursing history. Online nursing history courses can capitalize on e-learning technologies, and fit crowded curricula and student learning styles, while extending the reach of historians beyond traditional university walls. © 2012 Springer Publishing Company.

%X The profession of pharmacy is currently experiencing transformational change in health system practice models with pharmacists' provider status. Gaining buy-in and support of stakeholders in medicine, nursing, and other advocates for patient care is critical. To this end, building momentum to advance the profession will require experimentation with and utilization of more efficient ways to disseminate relevant information. Traditional methods to communicate can be inefficient and painstakingly slow. Health care providers are turning to social media to network, connect, engage, educate, and learn. Pharmacy leaders can use social media as an additional tool in the leadership toolkit. This article of the Director's Forum shows how social media can assist pharmacy leaders in further developing patient-centered pharmacy services.

%X With the widespread use of health information technologies, there is a growing need to educate healthcare providers on the use of technological innovations. Appropriate health information technology education is critical to ensure quality documentation, patient privacy, and safe healthcare. One promising strategy for educating clinicians is the use of participatory e-learning based on the principles of Web 2.0. However, there is a lack of literature on the practical applications of this training strategy in clinical settings. In this article, we briefly review the theoretical background and published literature on distance education, or e-learning, of health information technology, focusing on electronic health records. Next, we describe one example of a theoretically grounded interactive educational intervention that was implemented to educate nurses on new elements incorporated into the existing electronic health record system. We discuss organizational factors facilitating nurses' in-service education and provide an example of software designed to create interactive e-learning presentations. We also evaluate the results of our educational project and make suggestions for future applications. In conclusion, we suggest four core principles that should guide the construction and implementation of distant education for healthcare practitioners. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

%X OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the results of a systemised rapid review and synthesis of the literature undertaken to identify competencies required by nurse educators to facilitate simulation-based learning (SBL). DESIGN: An international collaboration undertook a protocol-based search, retrieval and critical review. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, ERIC, the Cochrane Library and Science Direct. The search was limited to articles published in English, 2002-2012. REVIEW METHODS: The search terms used: nurse*, learn*, facilitator, simula*, lecturer, competence, skill*, qualificat*, educator, health care, "patient simulation", "nursing education" and "faculty". The search yielded 2156 "hits", following a review of the abstracts, 72 full-text articles were extracted. These were screened against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria and nine articles were retained. Following critical appraisal, the articles were analyzed using an inductive approach to extract statements for categorization and synthesis as competency statements. RESULTS: This review confirmed that there was a modest amount of empirical evidence on which to base a competency framework. Those papers that provided descriptions of educator preparation identified simulation-based workshops, or experiential training, as the most common approaches for enhancing skills. SBL was not associated with any one theoretical perspective. Delivery of SBL appeared to demand competencies associated with planning and designing simulations, facilitating learning in "safe" environments, expert nursing knowledge based on credible clinical realism, reference to evidence-based knowledge and demonstration of professional values and identity. CONCLUSIONS: This review derived a preliminary competency framework. This needs further development as a model for educators delivering SBL as part of nursing curricula.

%X INTRODUCTION. Aeromedical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) is a component dimensioning of French Armed Forces foreign deployment. Considering the technical limitations of the previous collective MEDEVAC system (conversion of an Airbus A 310), the ministry of defense have asked for a new one, designed for multiple MEDEVAC of critically injured patients. The operational requirements of this project were permanent availability and ability to take off at H24 or earlier. METHODS.Weselected a non-dedicated vector among existing French Air Force Aircraft with cargo capacity, high range and permanent availability. A platform meeting of medical and aeronautical standards was then created, based on a combination of modules specifically designed to be changeable. The organization had to be modular, in order to be installed or uninstalled quickly and easily on the plane, and also adapt to a specific mission. Composition and training of medical teams manning this platform were also determined. RESULTS. The C135FR strategic tanker was chosen as a suitable vector. Eleven Aircraft have been modified to accommodate the medical solution. The technical platform includes patient care modules and logistical modules (2 racks, 1 preparation table and 1 centralized monitoring area). The Module Seriously Injured or Intensive Care Module allows the management of a patient on a respirator. The Module Slight Injury or Light Care Module allows the support of two lightly wounded. The medical team includes 11 to 12 people. This is a mixed team composed of medical and paramedical staff from hospitals, medical services unit and pooling of air conveyors. It consists of two intensivists, two air forces physicians, three anesthetist nurses, two air conveyors and two nurses. All have been trained on the ground and in flight. A twelfth place is reserved for a specialist (neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, cardiologist) or a liaison officer as part of a mission for the benefit of another nation. The team is sized to ensure its ability in taking charge of about 6 to 12 injured people during about 10 h for a mission lasting a total of 30 to 50 h. Designed to reproduce the conditions for monitoring a patient in an ICU, the composition of the conveying team was studied to ensure the continuum of care throughout the flight. CONCLUSIONS. The MEDEVAC system and its successful operational missions emphasize the versatility and efficiency of a solution based on mission-tailored “plug and play” modules easily and quickly installable aboard a non-dedicated aircraft.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To report on registered nurses' situation awareness as a precursor to decision-making when recording changes in patients' conditions. BACKGROUND: Progress notes are important to communicate patients' progress and detail changes in patients' conditions. However, documentation is often poorly completed. There is little work that examines nurses' decision-making during documentation. This study focused on describing situation awareness as a precursor to decision-making during documentation. DESIGN: This study used Endsley's (Situation Awareness Analysis and Measurement, 2000, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, NJ) work on situation awareness to guide and conceptualise information. The study was situated in a naturalistic paradigm to provide an interpretation of nurses' decision-making. METHODS: Think-aloud research methods and semi-structured interviews were employed to illuminate decision-making processes. Audio recordings and interview texts were individually examined for evidence of cues, informed by Endsley's (Situation Awareness Analysis and Measurement, 2000, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, NJ) descriptions of situation awareness. RESULTS: As patients' conditions changed, nurses used complex mental models and pattern-matching of information, drawing on all 3 levels of situation awareness during documentation. Level 1 situation awareness provided context, level 2 situation awareness signified a change in condition and its significance for the patient, and level 3 situation awareness was evident when nurses thought aloud about what this information indicated. Three themes associated with changes in patients' conditions emerged: deterioration in condition, not responding to prescribed treatments as expected and issues related to professional practice that impacted on patients' conditions. CONCLUSION: Nurses used a complex mental model for decision-making, drawing on 3 levels of situation awareness. Hamm's cognitive continuum theory, when related to situation awareness, is a useful decision-making theory to provide a platform on which to draw together components of situation awareness and provide a framework on which to base decision-making regarding documentation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding how RNs employ situation awareness and providing a framework for decision-making during documentation may assist effective documentation about changes in patients' conditions.

%X Due to the rapid growth of peritoneal dialysis (PD) program under the "PD First" policy of Thailand, it is necessary to have many voluntary well-training PD staffs and a good education program for PD nurses to serve an excellent PD outcome. In the present study novel devices, which could be practically used in PD patients, were developed by the creative PD trainee idea of to facilitate PD self-care and decrease work load of PD staffs. Young PD nurses in the 3rd generation of PD trainee program from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were assigned to develop novel tools in order to assisting patient care in real practice. The efficacy of these inventions and patient satisfaction were assessed by comparing with the standard method. The authors presented two interesting innovations in the present study. The first one, "Troubleshooting Wheel", contained six common complaints and the advice for correcting each problem in the platform of rotating wheel. Participants could solve problems more rapidly than using the standard handbook for PD (p < 0.01) and also found the correct responses more frequently than the handbook (p < 0.01). The second one, "Exit Site Abacus", the sliding platform with automatic calculation of the sum of exit site score, was the easier method in evaluating the exit site infection than the conventional exit site scoring using the Prowant's table or their own memory. Reinforcement of the development of PD nursing program not only increases the number of PD staffs but also contributes to the innovations for improving quality of PD care by the young new staffs.

%X Purpose: Despite impressive reductions in teen pregnancy in the United States, there continue to be significant disparities in unplanned pregnancy amongst urban adolescents and young adults. While use of long-acting methods is being promoted amongst young women, many still prefer shorter acting methods. Support for youth who have initiated moderately long acting contraception may be an important prevention strategy and research suggests that urban teens may have overcome the digital divide by the use of low cost cell phone services. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a text messaging reminder system to improve clinic attendance at family planning appointments among young women using Depo-Provera. Methods: Adolescents were recruited from an urban academic practice in a high teen/unplanned pregnancy prevalence community for this IRB approved randomized controlled clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were age 13-21 years, willingness to be randomized, currently using Depo-Provera, and having a cellular phone with text messaging capability for personal use. Adolescents in the intervention arm received a welcome message, daily text appointment reminders using the Compliance for Life (CFL) short messaging system (SMS) platform starting 72 hours before the clinical visit and healthy self-management messages over the course of the enrollment period. All participants completed a baseline web-based survey for collection of demographic, sexual health, and technology access/use data and were followed for up to 3 injection cycles. The CFL system recorded all outgoing and incoming textcommunications. The log-transformed number of days off schedule was analyzed using linear regression analysis in SAS. Results: The eligibility rate was 95%; recruitment rate was 91% with a total of 100 patients enrolled in a 3-month window. The majority of participants were African American, resided in low-income, single parent, mother-headed households. Most participants had cell phone plans that included unlimited text messaging and internet access. Eighty-seven percent of participants completed all 3 Depo-Provera cycles. Complete adherence to Depo-Appointments declined over time with 51 % for the first visit, 47% for the second visit, and 43% for the third visit. The proportion of adolescents who returned on time was higher for the first and second cycles, but not the third. Linear regression analyses reveal that adolescents in the intervention arm returned sooner than their control peers for the first, but not the 2nd and 3rd visits. (?=-0.75 95% CI: -1.4-0.06, p = .03). There was no overall difference in those who received injections within the optimal Depo-Provera Injection window due to additional clinical nursing outreach that resulted from missed visits per the existing clinic protocol for standard care. Conclusions: Pilot data from the DepoText intervention suggests that it is acceptable, feasible, and effective for improving attendance for family planning clinic appointments among urban adolescents. Additional research exploring the cost-effectiveness and longitudinal prevention effectiveness for unplanned pregnancy is warranted.

%X Background: Primary palliative care (PC) is critical to improving access to PC. Still, barriers exist to providing primary PC worldwide, including a lack of awareness, time, and training. Interactive online learning experiences can help overcome these. This project describes a massive open online course (MOOC)-Palliative Care Always-designed to build primary PC skills in a global audience. Methods: A team of PC providers and online instructional experts developed 12 modules that included: (1) patient scenes, (2) brief lectures, (3) empathy exercises, and (4) Google Hangout discussions. Course objectives included awareness of PC, practicing effective communication skills, basic symptom assessment and management. The target audience included oncology clinicians; secondary audience included patients and families. The MOOC launched in January 2016. Participant engagement, satisfaction and self-reported knowledge were assessed through pre/post-surveys. Multiple choice assessments captured knowledge gain. Follow-up assessments will be distributed three months post-MOOC. Results: By April 2016, the course reached 1,300 participants from 91 countries - 54% from the US, followed by India, Brazil, and Canada. 76% were healthcare professionals, the majority being nurses (40%), physicians (19%) and social workers (13%). The remaining 24% included patient, caregivers, and others interested in PC. Reasons for enrollment included interest in PC, personal growth and job relevance. On average, 27% of enrollees actively engaged week-over-week. Eighty-six percent of respondents were 'very satisfied' with the amount learned, and over 50% cited learning 'a great deal' in: communicating difficult news, goals of care, psychosocial and hospice care. 93% cited being 'very likely' to recommend the course. Conclusions: Interactive MOOC experiences have the potential to build PC awareness, primary skills and global PC networks. Upcoming iterations will incorporate: accommodations for varying levels of PC knowledge; additional opportunities for interaction between participants, including social networks; blended learning; and evaluation of impact on practice and healthcare outcomes.

%X BACKGROUND: We developed computer-based virtual patient (VP) cases to complement an interactive continuing medical education (CME) course that emphasizes skills practice using standardized patients (SP). Virtual patient simulations have the significant advantages of requiring fewer personnel and resources, being accessible at any time, and being highly standardized. Little is known about the educational effectiveness of these new resources. We conducted a randomized trial to assess the educational effectiveness of VPs and SPs in teaching clinical skills. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of VP cases when compared with live SP cases in improving clinical skills and knowledge. DESIGN: Randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five health care providers (registered nurses 45%, physicians 15%, other provider types 40%) who attended a CME program. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive either 4 live cases (n=32) or 2 live and 2 virtual cases (n=23). Other aspects of the course were identical for both groups. RESULTS: Participants in both groups were equivalent with respect to pre-post workshop improvement in comfort level (P=.66) and preparedness to respond (P=.61), to screen (P=.79), and to care (P=.055) for patients using the skills taught. There was no difference in subjective ratings of effectiveness of the VPs and SPs by participants who experienced both (P=.79). Improvement in diagnostic abilities were equivalent in groups who experienced cases either live or virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in performance and diagnostic ability were equivalent between the groups and participants rated VP and SP cases equally. Including well-designed VPs has a potentially powerful and efficient place in clinical skills training for practicing health care workers.

%X Clinical research is not actively promoted in most institutions: academic, hospitals and primary care based organizations seek funding without a realistic knowledge and balance of their available human resources and facilities. Fundraising efforts are the pre-requisite for any research becoming often a barrier to the development of articulated independent research (from epidemiology to personalized therapy). The promotion of the professional quality is based more on compulsory lifelong learning activity dealing with the most recent guidelines on best practice than on the implementation of innovation through the available information. Lifestyle intervention, sustainable procedures and therapies are still neglected tools that should be developed for enhancing evidence-based medicine. In the last decade, we developed three yearly postgraduate curricula to promote original thought, to provide basic and operationally useful skills, to teach and to explore the possibilities of setting up networks and existing collaborations. Vocational training integrated and participated within all clinical professionals (medical doctors, nurses, technicians, biologists, dietitians, physiotherapists, others) will facilitate those who wish to plan projects. The interaction and contribution of participants are the core of the training methodology and research is developed as a permanent mode of professional progress. The three lines are: E-learning and Telemedicine, Clinical Ultrasound and Culture and Strategy of Intervention on Lifestyles and Clinical Nutrition. Each year a total of 70 professionals are enrolled. The outcome is measured on the basis of the number of individual competitive projects submitted by trainees for funding to National or International Institutions. Results achieved are satisfactory:there is a significant increase of the number of the projects successfully submitted, which were proposed by 30% of the participants in 2012.

%X Cost-benefit management trends in Taiwan healthcare settings have led nurses to perform more invasive skills, such as Port-A cath administration of medications. Accordingly, nurses must be well-prepared prior to teaching by the mentor and supervision method. The purpose of the current study was to develop a computer-assisted protocol using virtual reality (VR) in performing Port-A cath as a training program for novice nurses. A pre-tested and post-tested control group experimental design was used in this study. Seventy-seven novice nurses were invited from one large medical center hospital in North Taiwan. Thirty-seven and forty nurses were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. First, we designed a 40 minute port-A cath injection VR simulation. Then, the experimental group practiced this simulation two times over 3 weeks. The control group attended the traditional class. The post-test 1 was right after completion of the simulation practice. The post-test 2 was after the second simulation practice in 3 weeks. The results showed that most novice nurses lacked Port-A cath experience both in the classroom and during the period of their practice training. The knowledge score regarding the Port-A cath technique was significantly higher in the nurses that participated in the simulation training than in the control group. The novice nurses were most satisfied with the reduction in their fear of performing the Port-A cath technique and their enhanced clinical skills. VR simulation significantly reduced error rates and increased correct equipment selection, showing that nurses who participated in the simulation may be better prepared for inserting Port-A cath. © 2006 Springer.

%X Background: Falls have been identified as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the older adults. Virtual reality (VR) technologies have been used as an assessment and treatment tool in rehabilitation. Purpose: This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial was to determine the effectiveness of VR exercise in reducing falls risk and incidence among the older adults with a history of falls using Nintendo's Wii Fitα balance board. Methods: Sixty older subjects aged 65 and above who lived in a nursing home participated this study. They were randomly allocated to balance training with either Wii Fit equipment or conventional exercise. The exercise was organized in one hour session which was held on three days a week for six weeks. Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) scores and incidence of falls were observed with subsequent intent-to-treat statistical analyses. Results: Independent t-tests showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the average pre-test PPA values and numbers of falls over previous one year between the two groups. Two-way repeated measures of ANOVA did, however, show significant interactions in the PPA z-scores and falls incidence. Within both the Wii Fit and conventional training groups, paired t-tests showed that there were significant differences in their PPA z-scores and falls incidence before and after the respective interventions. However, independent t-tests showed that there were statistically significant differences in the post-test PPA z-scores and number of falls between the two groups. The subjects of the Wii Fit training group showed significantly greater improvement in both outcome measures. Conclusion(s): Wii Fit balance training was more effective than conventional balance training in reducing falls risk and incidence among these institutionalized older persons with a history of falls. Implications: The virtual reality exercise in the form of action-video games can be a choice of falls prevention program for older adults with a history of falls.

%X The Internet is becoming the preferred place to find information. Millions of people go online in search of health and medical information. Likewise, the demand for Web-based courses is growing. This paper presents the development, utilization, and evaluation of a Web-based e-learning course for nursing students, entitled Integration of Pathophysiology into Pharmacology. The pathophysiology component included cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous and immune system diseases, while the pharmacology component was developed based on 150 commonly used drugs. One hundred and nineteen Year 1 nursing students took part in the course. The Web-based e-learning course materials were uploaded to a WebCT for students' self-directed learning and attempts to pass two scheduled online quizzes. At the end of the semester, students were given a questionnaire to measure the e-learning experience. Their experience in the e-learning course was a positive one. Students stated that they were able to understand rather than memorize the subject content, and develop their problem solving and critical thinking abilities. Online quizzes yielded satisfactory results. In the focus group interview, students indicated that they appreciated the time flexibility and convenience associated with Web-based learning, and also made good suggestions for enhancing Web-based learning. The Web-based approach is promising for teaching and learning pathophysiology and pharmacology for nurses and other healthcare professionals. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X The Internet is becoming the preferred place for finding information. Millions of people go online in search of health and medical information. Likewise, health care professionals must be able to retrieve and manage information in an efficient, effective manner. The development of health technology and informatics (HTI) has been rapid, yet little is known about the knowledge and attitudes of nursing students with regard to using HTI. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore nursing students' knowledge of and attitudes toward using HTI and to use an e-learning workshop to enhance the effective use of HTI. In Phase I, 115 first-year full-time nursing students were invited to complete a 13-item questionnaire regarding knowledge of and attitudes toward computer and Internet use, knowledge of HTI, and attitudes toward the future development of HTI. Participants perceived themselves to be knowledgeable in computer and Internet use, while knowledge of HTI was perceived to be low and attitudes toward the future development of HTI were generally positive. Phase II was an e-learning HTI workshop; topics included an introduction to HTI, examples of HTI in use, and the application and implementation of various HTI projects. There were 30 participants in the E-learning workshop, and their feedback was positive. Nurses and all health care professionals must be prepared to participate in the development of health technology and informatics. Teaching and learning activities should be geared toward mastery of HTI in the nursing education curriculum in order to enhance health care quality and safety. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X With the advancement in educational technology and internet access in recent years, nursing academia is searching for ways to widen nurses' educational opportunities. The online nursing courses are drawing more attention as well. The online nursing courses are very important e-learning tools for nursing students. The research combines the innovation diffusion theory and technology acceptance model, and adds two research variables, perceived financial cost and computer self-efficacy to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model to study nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. Based on 267 questionnaires collected from six universities in Taiwan, the research finds that studies strongly support this new hybrid technology acceptance model in predicting nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. This research finds that compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived financial cost and computer self-efficacy are critical factors for nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. By explaining nursing students' behavioral intentions from a user's perspective, the findings of this research help to develop more user friendly online nursing courses and also provide insight into the best way to promote new e-learning tools for nursing students. This research finds that compatibility is the most important research variable that affects the behavioral intention to use the online nursing courses.

%X Background: The development of network communication science and technology has accorded a special benefit to learning. Online courses have also become the most popular and important learning resource among students. Objectives: Overall, this research aims to explore what are the important factors making students use online courses. Design: The research combines the technology acceptance model and the innovation diffusion theory, and adds four research variables, computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, perceived financial cost and perceived information quality to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model to study students' behavioral intention to use online courses. Settings: Based on 228 questionnaires collected from nursing students in Taiwan. Methods: The structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model. Participants: The survey began with e-mail and telephone interviews in January 2006. The interviewees were 348 students of Taiwan's universities. Because some of the replying subjects have never taken those courses and some did not complete the questionnaires, there were 228 valid questionnaires from students of Taiwan's universities who have taken online courses. The responding rate was 65.52%. Results: This research found that computer anxiety had a negative effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=-0.21, P<0.01). Computer self-efficacy had a positive effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=0.37, P<0.01). Compatibility had a positive effect on both the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=0.18, P<0.01) and perceived usefulness (γ=0.3, P<0.01). Perceived usefulness had a positive effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses (β=0.14, P<0.05). Perceived ease of use had a positive effect on perceived usefulness (γ=0.23, P<0.01), the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=0.24, P<0.01). Perceived financial cost had a negative effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=-0.16, P<0.01). Perceived information quality had a positive effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses (γ=0.11, P<0.05). The findings of this research help to develop more user friendly online courses for students. Conclusions: (1) Computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived financial cost, and perceived information quality were the critical factors that impacted on students' behavioral intention to use online courses. (2) Computer anxiety and perceived financial cost had a negative effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses. (3) The present study added four new research constructs (computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, perceived financial cost, and perceived information quality) to the research model so that it would be more complete; this improved the fit of the whole model. (4) Computer self-efficacy, compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived information quality had a positive effect on the behavioral intention to use online courses. By explaining students' behavioral intention from a user's perspective, the findings of this research help to provide insight into the best way to promote new e-learning tools for students. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) experience distressing changes in body image. They often find it difficult to describe their perceptions of affected body parts to clinicians. Self portrait sketches are sometimes used, but this method is limited by the individual's capacity to draw. Computer graphics offer an opportunity to provide an interactive tool to communicate perceptions of body image. The purpose of this project was to develop an application that patients will be able to use to create a 3D model of their perceived body image. Methods: Using data from a previous exploratory study of body perception and consultation with a person with CRPS, the first prototype digital media application was developed. The application allows modification of an avatar to depict alterations in size, shape, colour or visible surface texture of multiple body areas. It has so far been tested with ten patients, admitted to an inpatient CRPS rehabilitation programme, who gave consent to participate in the research. Participants used the application in a consultation with the research nurse. Audio recordings were made of the participants using the application and participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire to ascertain their views and experience of using the tool. Responses to questionnaires and audio recordings were subjected to content analysis to determine acceptability of the application and its limitations. Results: The images produced by all ten participants are powerful illustrations of the distortions in body perception that patients with CRPS experience. Here is one striking example of a participant's reaction to her experience of using creating her body perception image: “. . . it was quite bizarre seeing a picture of how exactly I feel as a person, cause I've never had the opportunity of looking at that, like that” “It puts it into perspective what I've got, its just I don't know how to explain it. It looks in human form exactly how I feel and I've never had that. I've sat and said this hand feels longer and feels wider from there. I know I can see it but this is the first time someone else” All participants reported using the tool was an acceptable method for communicating their body perception. It was considered better than the drawings they currently use in interviews with the Occupational Therapist. There were some additional features they identified to improve the usability of the application. Conclusions: This is the first time body perception has been captured satisfactorily. The images created were far more descriptive than the drawings used in current practice within a clinical interview. Further development is planned to extract measurements from images.

%X Background: Loneliness associates with negative effects on older adult's health, while mental illness stigma associates with poor quality of life including increase social avoidance and isolation. There is, therefore, a potential inter-relationship between loneliness and mental illness self-stigma in older age, yet a limited number of studies aimed at examining it. Aims: The aim of this study was: (a) to examine the inter-relationships between loneliness and self-stigma among older adults with mental health problems in nursing homes, and (b) to explore how this population experiences loneliness and self-stigma. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was utilised. The first phase involved a questionnaire survey (n = 16), while the second phase involved a qualitative study (n = 10). Results: Low levels of self-stigma (56.3%) were reported. However, a substantial number of older adults scored high on the self-stigma scale (43.8%). A relationship between stereotype endorsement and marital status (sig. = .010) was identified. More than half of the sample (68.8%) reported feelings of loneliness. There was also a correlation between loneliness, age (sig. = .062) and religiosity (sig. = .044). Seven themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: “social loneliness', “emotional loneliness”, “emotional reactions”, “coping mechanisms”, “degree of insight into illness”, “understanding and view towards mental illness”, and “behavioural reactions”. Discussion: The small sample size of the quantitative study reveals the various methodological challenges in implementing research in long term care facilities. However, the qualitative study provides useful insights into the topic. Conclusions: The study offers the platform for further investigation on the topic, while discusses implications for policy and practice.

%X Background: To compare the impact of sleep deprivation after 24-hour duty (post-call) with that of 8-hour work (post-work) on product quality (PQ) and procedure effectiveness (PE) in a laparoscopic physical simulator. Methods: Voluntary surgeons and nurses were pretested with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Minimally Invasive Surgical Trainer-Virtual Reality (MIST-VR). Surgical task was suturing perforated ulcer on a foam stomach in a physical simulator. PQ and PE were measured by accuracy error (AE), tissue damage (TD) leak rate (LR), goal- (GDA) non-goal-directed actions (NGDA), and operating time (OT), respectively. Construct validity was assessed comparing measures when surgeons and nurses performed the surgical task. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was assessed by Kendall's tau b coefficient. An 80% power parallel block randomization design at alpha = .05 required 60 subjects. Results: Thirty-two post-call surgeons and 32 post-work surgeons were well matched for age, gender, practice duration, and ESS and MIST-VR scores. The amount of time slept in the previous 24 hours was 1.5 versus 6.5 hours (P < .05). AE (1.0 mm vs. .5 mm), TD (2.18 mm vs. 2.18 mm), LR (56.2% vs. 65.6%), GDA (33.5 vs. 32.5), NGDA (.56 vs. .31), and OT (381.0 seconds vs. 364.5 seconds) were not significantly different when 32 surgeons in the post-call arm were compared with their 32 counterparts in the post-work arm, respectively. Construct validity was shown by significant improvement in 4 outcome measures (AE 1.0 mm vs. 2.0 mm, P = .00001; GDA 32.5 vs. 39.0, P = .07, NGDA. 43 vs. .96, P = .045; and OT 377.5 vs. 557.0, P = .0005) when 64 surgeons performed the task as compared to 64 nurses. Tau b for IRR was 1.0 (P < .0001) for AE, TD, LR, and OT, .75 (P = .325) for GDA, and .77 (P = .305) for NGDA. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation had no impact on the studied outcome measures of a surgical task performed in a laparoscopic simulator. © 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Introduction: Gastric cancer ranks the third highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Except Japan and Korea where screening program is implemented, most of the gastric cancers were diagnosed at advanced stage. We suspect one of the reason why gastric cancers around the world were detected late is because of limited knowledge and experience of endoscopists. Accordingly, the authors have developed an Internet-based e-learning system to teach medical practitioners how to detect early gastric cancer using standard white light endoscopy. Aims & Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of the elearning system on teaching good practice for endoscopic screening of gastric cancer. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Medical practitioners around the world participated in this study with a signed consent form. The participants first undertook a pre-test via Internet, and then they were randomly allocated into two groups (e-learning and non-e-learning groups). Pre-adjustment strata were the pre-test score, experience of endoscopy, a nurse endoscopist or a medical doctor, and medical institution and country. The participants only in the e-learning group were allowed to access to the elearning system that consisted of video lectures to learn basic knowledge and self-exercise tests to accumulate experience. A post-test was conducted in the both groups two months after the pre-test. The pre-determined primary endpoint was the difference in improvement rate of the test result (post-test score/ pre-test score) between the two groups. After completion of the post-test, the elearning system was opened for all participants. Results: Five-hundred fifteen medical practitioners from 35 countries were assessed eligibility for this study. Finally, 322 participants who met inclusion criteria completed the pre-test and enrolled in this study. One-hundred sixty-six were allocated to the e-learning group and 166 were allocated to the non-elearning. Among them, 151 participants in the e-learning group and 144 in the non-e-learning group had completed the post-test, and were included into the analysis. The mean improvement rates (standard deviation) of the test result in the e-learning and the non-e-learning groups were 1.24 (0.26) vs. 1.00 (0.16), respectively (P<0.001). Namely, our e-learning system yielded substantial improvement to medical practitioners in the e-learning group, while there was no improvement for those in the non-e-learning group. Conclusion: This global study demonstrated efficacy of our e-learning system to improve ability for endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer among medical practitioners worldwide. The effectiveness will be evaluated on improvement of early gastric cancer detection rate of all participants in actual clinical practice.

%X BACKGROUND: This review is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2006. Needle-related procedures are a common source of pain and distress for children. Our previous review on this topic indicated that a number of psychological interventions were efficacious in managing pediatric needle pain, including distraction, hypnosis, and combined cognitive behavioural interventions. Considerable additional research in the area has been published since that time. OBJECTIVES: To provide an update to our 2006 review assessing the efficacy of psychological interventions for needle-related procedural pain and distress in children and adolescents. SEARCH METHODS: Searches of the following databases were conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and Web of Science. Requests for relevant studies were also posted on various electronic list servers. We ran an updated search in March 2012, and again in March 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related procedures. Only RCTs with at least five participants in each study arm comparing a psychological intervention group with a control or comparison group were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and a third author helped with data extraction and coding for one non-English study. Included studies were coded for quality using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for all analyses using Review Manager 5.2 software. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine trials with 3394 participants were included. The most commonly studied needle procedures were venipuncture, intravenous (IV) line insertion, and immunization. Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with the most evidence available for children under 12 years of age. Consistent with the original review, the most commonly studied psychological interventions for needle procedures were distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The majority of included studies (19 of 39) examined distraction only. The additional studies from this review update continued to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis. No evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT (at least two or more cognitive or behavioural strategies combined), parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress. No conclusions could be drawn about interventions of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as evidence was available from single studies only. In addition, the Risk of bias scores indicated several domains with high or unclear bias scores (for example, selection, detection, and performance bias) suggesting that the methodological rigour and reporting of RCTs of psychological interventions continue to have considerable room for improvement. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis for needle-related pain and distress in children and adolescents, with no evidence currently available for preparation and information or both, combined CBT, parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality. Additional research is needed to further assess interventions that have only been investigated in one RCT to date (that is, memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, and distraction plus suggestion). There are continuing issues with the quality of trials examining psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress.

%X Purpose: Every year, an increasing number of patients with heart failure receive a cardiac device. Problems in these patients need to be detected early on. Remote monitoring systems for that purpose have spread, but these systems alone are not enough; assistance with self-management and mental support are also needed. Thus, this study sought to develop nursing intervention program via tablet PC for remotely monitored patients with advanced heart failure who have a cardiac device. Method: In this study, literature was reviewed and semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients. The review of the literature involved a search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library using the keywords “heart failure,” “disease management, and “program” and a time frame of 2006 to 2011. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 5 patients with an ICD and 13 with a CRT-D. Content analysis of their responses was performed to determine who sort of assistance they wanted remote monitoring to provide. Results were compiled and an assistance program was developed. Results: The review identified 15 original manuscripts on RCTs among the literature. The manuscripts indicated that numerous opportunities for patients to talk with medical personnel and patient education were effective ways to prevent worsening of heart failure. Responses from semi-structured interviews fell into 4 categories: “I want to check my results myself,” “I would like lifestyle advice based on my results,” “I want to decrease the number of times I have to go to the hospital,” and “I want to leave everything to medical personnel.” Based on these findings, an assistance program predicated on increased self-efficacy was devised. The program had 3 major components: 1) at home, the patient used a tablet PC to notify medical personnel of his or her weight, blood pressure, and symptoms, 2) e-learning was used to verify that patients had basic knowledge regarding heart failure, and 3) sent data were checked by a nurse and the patient was given advice by phone or tablet PC to facilitate self-management. Conclusion: A nursing intervention program via tablet PC was developed for remotely monitored patients with a cardiac device to manage heart failure. In the next phase, a comparative study with an experimental group and a control group must be conducted in order to examine the program's effectiveness.

%X Background and Aims According to Dutch legislation nurses are allowed to perform a number of medical procedures, known as “reserved procedures”. Nurses are permitted to perform these procedures, but only after thorough education, training, examination and authorisation. The aim was to develop and implement an efficient and effective model to facilitate these demands, on behalf of the (non-ICU) nursing staff of our children's hospital. Methods We developed a cyclical blended learning method containing: e-learning, training of local assessors, bedside teaching, structural examination and registration. The tool we developed is: • feasible in daily practice, • optimally using the local available skills and knowledge and • based on the already present protocols. Results • We trained and authorised 30 local assessors. • We trained, examined and authorised 215 nurses of 6 paediatric departments. • We developed and used 8 e-learning modules (containing 13 procedures). • We used this model in a 4-year cycle. • We used a model which divides the set of reserved procedures into. a. a general part (16 procedures) and b. a ward-specific part (5-21 procedures). Discussion/conclusion We successfully designed, introduced, implemented an effective and efficient intervention to ensure adequate nursing skills and knowledge regarding the “reserved procedures” in a children's hospital.

%X One of the fundamental problems facing providers and commissioners of health services is how to maintain the skills and knowledge of the workforce during the initial development and implementation of home care services. This small-scale project sought to ascertain if it was possible to use human patient simulation scenarios to educate community nurses about how to recognize when care at home is appropriate and when it is not. A series of scenarios were developed and delivered to small groups of community nursing staff. A total of 18 qualified nurses took part in the project. Participants were asked to report their level of confidence in the diagnosis, management and recognition of patient deterioration for each of the scenarios prior to and after the session. The results show increased confidence across all participants in each of the scenarios.

%X In 2008, approximately 69,200 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) were diagnosed with cancer, second only to heart disease for males in this age group. Despite recent guidelines from professional organizations and clinical research that AYA oncology patients want information about reproductive health topics and physician support for nurses to address these issues with patients, existing research finds few oncology nurses discuss this topic with patients due to barriers such as lack of training. This article describes an innovative eLearning training program, entitled Educating Nurses about Reproductive Issues in Cancer Healthcare. The threefold purpose of this article is to: (1) highlight major reproductive health concerns relevant to cancer patients, (2) describe the current status of reproductive health and oncology communication and the target audience for the training, and (3) present a systematic approach to curriculum development, including the content analysis and design stages as well as the utilization of feedback from a panel of experts. The resulting 10-week curriculum contains a broad-based approach to reproductive health communication aimed at creating individual- and practice-level change.

%X The role of clinical instructors in preparing student nurses for the realities and dynamics of clinical practice cannot be underestimated. Previous literature has identified scaffolding as a diagnostic tool that enables both supervisor and learner to recognize knowledge-in-waiting and knowledge-in-use (Spouse, 1998). The pivotal role of scaffolding in the teaching-learning process cannot be underestimated. However, literature pertaining to its use in nursing is hard to locate (Dickieson, Carter and Walsh, 2008; Spouse, 1998). Hence, this qualitative study was conducted to capture nursing students' views and experiences of the scaffolding moves of their clinical instructors as they learn medication administration. From the thickness and richness of the descriptions of a select group of nursing students (n=31) in a comprehensive university in the Philippines, three interesting and yet intersecting themes surfaced relative to the scaffolding moves employed by clinical instructors, which include: (1) thought-provoking; (2) focus-steering; and (3) action-enabling. The said moves are carried out in a timely fashion to facilitate students' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes pertaining to medication administration. Through the understanding of clinical instructors' scaffolding behaviors, this study provides a platform for more effective clinical instruction aimed at supporting future nurses' role in medication safety.

%X A variety of approaches to teaching and learning are required to encompass the complexity of nursing. Simulated practice involves computer-based simulated environments, human patient simulation and role play, enabling multiple learning objectives to be taught in a realistic clinical environment without harming patients. The Nursing and Midwifery Council recognizes the use of simulated practice and has enabled higher education pre-registration nurse programme providers to incorporate a maximum of 300 hours of simulated practice as part of the 2300-hour practice hours component. However, not all students respond positively to simulated activity, which should be used to augment clinical practice and not replace it. It is important to ensure the quality of the simulation enables the educational experience to be positive for students.

%X Session Description/Moderator Details.- Evidence-based medicine in geriatrics Geriatric patients often have multiple chronic conditions, use many medications and may suffer from cognitive and functional impairments. A study about prevalence of morbidities in the elderly showed, that 82% of patients aged 65 and over had at least one chronic condition; 24% had even four or more conditions [1]. Due to deteriorating organ functions they are prone to medication-related side effects [2]. Considering these complex problems, arriving at the best treatment for individual older people is complicated. To provide the best care, doctors need to base their decision on the best available evidence. When considering evidence-based medicine in geriatrics, several problems need to be addressed. In the first place, solid evidence concerning elderly is scarce. Often, elderly are excluded from trials because of multimorbidity or merely because of their age. Also, eligible patients should give informed consent for participation in a trial. This is complicated for patients that are not able to do this because of dementia or delirium. Additionally, in trials without age-limit, the numbers are often too small to draw conclusion in a subgroup of older patients. Besides, searching for geriatric information can be difficult, as geriatric information is published in a wide range of journals and not labelled consequently in databases. In this symposium, we aim to highlight several issues in doing research with geriatric patients in order to increase their participation in trials. Also, we provide some tips and tricks in incorporating evidence-based medicine in research and daily practice. Outline of the symposium: the symposium will be chaired by dr. Sophia de Rooij. Each presentation will take 15-20 minutes, leaving 15-30 minutes for general discussion: -what's different about older people? - Key issues in the conduct and reporting of RCTs - addressing comorbidity, frailty, cognition; - search filters for geriatric medicine; - creating evidence from individual patient data; - improving assessment and management of multimorbid elderly in clinical practice; - general discussion. Short information on the authors: David Stott holds the David Cargill Chair of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Glasgow. He is in the lead of the Cochrane Health Care in Older People's Field. A major emphasis in his current research program is prediction and prevention of late-life cerebrovascular disease and the associated cognitive decline and disability. His research program relies on extensive collaborative links, including with biostatistics (the Robertson Centre), clinical biochemistry and haemostasis at the University of Glasgow, nursing and the professions allied to medicine and with other academic centres of Geriatric Medicine in the UK, the Netherlands and Australia. Furthermore, he contributes actively to both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and acts as supervisor/advisor for many PhD-students, MScs and MDs. Esther van de Glind is a resident for geriatrics. In 2010, she started her PhD project at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam with working title: “Evidence-based medicine in geriatrics”. This project aims to improve evidence-based medicine in clinical geriatric practice. Part of this is to investigate what is known already and to make evidence better available for the clinician. Lotty Hooft is a clinical epidemiologist, working as a scientific staff member (assistant professor) at the Dutch Cochrane Centre at the AMC, since October 2003. Her focus of research is on improving methodology, report and implementation of results of systematic reviews, including systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. She is also the director of the trial register in the Netherlands and chair of the WHO Best Practice Working Group of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Gunnar Akner is professor in Geriatric Medicine at Örebro University in Sweden and senior consultant geriatrician. He has been involved in clinical re ea ch in frail and multimorbid elderly for many years, focusing on overview and integrated management regarding medical drugs, nutrition, physical function/activity, technical aids and ADL-support. He has been the president of Swedish Society for Geriatric Medicine 2000-2005 and Swedish Society for Clinical Nutrition 2006-2011. He was chairman and editor for a systematic review of scientific treatment studies of people 65 years and older published 2003 by the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (http://sbu.se/en/Published/Vit/Geriatriccare- and-treatment/).

%X Delirium occurs frequently in elderly hospitalised patients and is associated with higher mortality, increased length of hospital stay, functional decline, and admission to long-term care. Healthcare professionals frequently do not recognise delirium, indicating that education can play an important role in improving delirium care for hospitalised elderly. Previous studies have indicated that e-learning can provide an effective way of educating healthcare professionals and improving quality of care, though results are inconsistent. This stepped wedge cluster randomised trial will assess the effects of a complementary delirium e-learning course on the implementation of quality improvement initiative, which aims to enhance the recognition and management of delirium in elderly patients. The trial will be conducted in 18 Dutch hospitals and last 11 months. Measurements will be taken in all participating wards using monthly record reviews, in order to monitor delivered care. These measurements will include the percentage of elderly patients who were screened for the risk of developing delirium, use of the Delirium Observation Screening scale, use of nursing or medical interventions, and the percentage of elderly patients who were diagnosed with delirium. Data regarding the e-learning course will be gathered as well. These data will include user characteristics, information regarding use of the course, delirium knowledge before and after using the course, and the attitude and intentions of nurses concerning delirium care. The study will be conducted in internal medicine and surgical wards of eighteen hospitals that are at the beginning stages of implementing the Frail Elderly Project in the Netherlands. Better recognition of elderly patients at risk for delirium and subsequent care is expected from the introduction of an e-learning course for nurses that is complementary to an existing quality improvement project. This trial has the potential to demonstrate that e-learning can be a vital part of the implementation process, especially for quality improvement projects aimed at complex health issues such as delirium. The study will contribute to a growing body of knowledge concerning e-learning and the effects it can have on knowledge as well as delivered care. Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR2885.

%X Our study presents an overview of the issues that were brought forward by participants of a moral case deliberation (MCD) project in two elderly care organizations. The overview was inductively derived from all case descriptions (N = 202) provided by participants of seven mixed MCD groups, consisting of care providers from various professional backgrounds, from nursing assistant to physician. The MCD groups were part of a larger MCD project within two care institutions (residential homes and nursing homes). Care providers are confronted with a wide variety of largely everyday ethical issues. We distinguished three main categories: 'resident's behavior', 'divergent perspectives on good care' and 'organizational context'. The overview can be used for agendasetting when institutions wish to stimulate reflection and deliberation. It is important that an agenda is constructed from the bottom-up and open to a variety of issues. In addition, organizing reflection and deliberation requires effort to identify moral questions in practice whilst at the same time maintaining the connection with the organizational context and existing communication structures. Once care providers are used to dealing with divergent perspectives, inviting different perspectives (e.g. family members) to take part in the deliberation, might help to identify and address ethical 'blind spots'.

%X Aim: To describe an overview of issues addressed in our unit's moral deliberation group and the subsequent impact on practice. Method: Annually in the LUMC, approximately 40 children undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (SCT) for either malignant (55%) or non-malignant diseases (45%). Features of SCT include lengthy admissions, complex treatments and risk of serious complications including death. To address the ethical dilemmas encountered by families and caretakers we established in 2009 a structured moral deliberation group to facilitate discussion and improve care. Multidisciplinary monthly meetings were scheduled and chaired by a Health Related Ethics and Law expert. A specialist nurse with ethics training prepared cases for discussion. All medical and non-medical personnel were invited to participate. Results: Between October 2009 and October 2013, 31 meetings took place. In 16 meetings individual patient concerns were discussed and in the remainder more general themes (Table). Participation increased over time from initially 11 to on average 20 participants. Over the years this has resulted in interdisciplinary exchange of ideas, increased understanding of decision making and reduced frustration and stress among the different SCT team members. The group has discussed patient's 'good medical care', clarified criteria for discharge and responsibilities post-SCT and changed focus on 'how' and no longer 'if' SCT can be undertaken in cases of complicating psychosocial circumstances. We also established a new workgroup to review parental involvement and confirmed the importance of routine pre-SCT psychological assessment to explore family coping mechanisms. Conclusion: Structural moral deliberation provides a platform where multidisciplinary consideration can be given to the ethical dilemmas that accompany SCT. The meaning of 'good care' can be defined. Both the quality of care delivered as well as staff communication are improved. (Table Presented).

venous thromboembolism
%X Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important safety issue in the inpatient mental health care of older people. In a survey of specialist mental health staff, knowledge of deep vein thrombosis was good. More variable awareness of the presentation and risk factors for pulmonary embolism indicates the need for training integrated into regular physical health care updates. Currently, failure to adequately screen and prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) is estimated to cause between 25,000 and 32,000 potentially avoidable deaths annually in the United Kingdom. The authors aimed to assess the awareness of VTE in clinical staff working in Mental Health Services for Older People, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys National Health Service Foundation Trust. A questionnaire was devised to assess knowledge of VTE symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and treatment in clinical staff working in Mental Health Service for Older Peoples' inpatient units. Forty-nine nurses, 12 consultant psychiatrists, and 11 clinical pharmacists responded. A significant proportion of staff had previous involvement in VTE treatment. Staff had significantly more limited knowledge of pulmonary embolism compared to deep vein thrombosis with areas for improvement in presentation, risk factors, and prevention. The study confirms a need for improved awareness among all clinical staff including nurses, pharmacists, and doctors, which can be met by including VTE awareness in First Response training, and encouraging use of the Department of Health VTE e-learning tool.

%X When physicians interview patients with ambiguous or nonspecific symptoms, they often try to reassure them with the purpose of explaining that no dangerous illness or disease is causing the symptoms. Unfortunately the evidence suggests that patients with benign (back) pain instead feel misunderstood, frustrated and unsatisfied with the consultation. Validation is a communication method that focuses on understanding and empathy as a platform for problem solving and it may be applicable for interviews in medical settings. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of validation on patient satisfaction, pain and affect. To this end 28 nurses with (re)current back pain were recruited and randomly assigned to be interviewed in a validating or invalidating condition. Patient satisfaction, affect, pain, disability, pain catastrophizing, and fear of movement were assessed immediately after the interview. The results show that the participants in the validated group were more satisfied with the interview than participants in the invalidating condition. Moreover, they showed a significant decrease on all measures of negative affect as well as for pain. For example, there was a significant between group difference in frustration where frustration decreased in the validation group, while it increased in the invalidation condition. A validating communication style seems to be beneficial for enhancing patient satisfaction, as well as diminishing negative affect and pain intensity ratings. Our results suggest that validation might be a viable technique to use in clinical examinations of patients suffering pain. © 2011 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.

Part of the content was developed in an online format. To capture the development process and the e-learning writing experience, a focus group was arranged for the content writers. The session was audio-recorded and tapes were transcribed. All the data were subjected to thematic analysis. Twenty-three sub-themes were identified in the 72 comments. These were grouped under six themes, corresponding to the developmental stages of e-learning. The highest number of comments fell under the theme of preparation, followed by content development, evaluation, general design and structure, and finally delivery. Team working contributed to the success of the writing process, reflecting the theme of working interprofessionally.

%X It is well-established that educator development is important for optimal curriculum delivery and student engagement, particularly in the science and health-related professional fields. Educator development may include teaching workshops, peer-to-peer mentorship, and professional training. Here, we describe a free-of-charge, community-oriented outreach program for high school and college educators that incorporates workshops and hands-on training in cadaverbased anatomical sciences, teaching methodologies, patient simulation laboratories, and current bench-to-bedside research. To date, this is the only workshop of its kind in the Wiregrass region. Educators from nursing and other allied health college programs as well as high school science educators attended the Health and Anatomy in the Wiregrass Educator Workshop, held this year during summer 2016. This was the third annual educator workshop, and this year's theme was the Respiratory system. All sessions were led by medical school faculty. Attendees rotated through the following programs: 1. Hands-on anatomy laboratory with a prosected human cadaver and dissection of porcine lungs and heart, 2. Respiratory-case simulation laboratory using the SimMan® patient simulator, 3. Lung biologist guest lecture on pseudomonas aeruginosa research, and 4. Team-based Learning (TBL) interactive workshop involving a clinical respiratory case. Attendees were asked to complete a survey immediately postworkshop. One hundred percent of respondents strongly agreed that the workshop was useful to them as educators, with 71% citing the TBL experience as valuable to their development as educators and 42% stating that the anatomy laboratory was important to them. The majority of attendees stated that the use of hands-on, interactive sessions with skilled facilitators as the main strength of the workshop. Offering a resource that benefits local educators may improve the educational backbone of the region as well as educator enthusiasm for teaching in the health and bio-sciences.

%X A decision support system for the management of oral hypoglycaemic therapy in type II diabetes was evaluated. The rule set contained therein forms the basis of a prototype computer programme, but in order to assess the robustness of the individual rules, it was decided it was necessary to use a paper-based form of the rule set. A nurse with no previous experience of managing type II diabetes was trained to use the system and then undertook the exclusive management of half of all new type II diabetics, from a district population of 300 000, over a 16-month period. General practices within this area were divided into two groups, study and control, matching for size, geographical area and standards of existing diabetes care. Patients (n = 102) from the study group practices were then assigned to her care. Those patients (n = 116) in the control group of practices were treated according to their normal procedures. The decision support system for oral hypoglycaemic therapy was based on the following criteria: the current type of treatment (six levels); current glycaemic control (HbA, and FBS) - whether improving, steady or worsening; and weight - %IBW, whether rising, steady or falling. Each of these parameters was carefully defined on the basis of established practice and clinical experience. Patients after initial education were seen at their usual clinic by the nurse only, on a monthly basis, until satisfactory glycaemic control Was established and thereafter reviewed 3 monthly. She was also responsible for ensuring the organisation of Diabetes Annual Review procedures. The medical records of the control group patients were examined at the end of the study and data on glycaemic control and Annual Reviews extracted. In the study group 98% patients achieved HbA, levels within the normal range and all patients had full annual reviews performed. The control practices achieved much poorer degrees of metabolic control (P < 0.01) and completed fewer annual reviews. The study group did not demonstrate a significantly increased frequency of clinical hypoglycaemia consequent upon better blood sugar control. No exceptions to the rule set, as initially defined, were detected. In conclusion, this decision support system was successful at achieving standards of diabetes control and care equal to or better than conventional structures of diabetes caret Implementation of such a system, on a simple computer platform, could greatly assist and possibly improve diabetes management in general practice.

%X Night vision technology is nothing new. In fact, the military rely significantly on this technology during nighttime operations. A surgeon is like a medical soldier in the battlefield. His/her only mission is that of keeping people alive. Due to many technological advances, patients cannot only train on relaxation while visiting their doctors but also get distracted by playing videogames while waiting for them. Furthermore, this virtual reality experience can be enhanced if the patient wears goggles or Head Mounted Displays under dimmed or absence of lights. The purpose of this study was to test if a surgeon could operate when extending into such a dark condition situation, but in the surgical suite. Therefore, a surgeon performed seven open surgeries on rabbits. All surgeries were performed on the thorax and abdomen regions. Specifically, the surgeon was able to perform these surgeries by wearing on his head a micro camera with infrared light and a night vision goggles. The first assistant used this same system while the scrub nurse and the anesthesiologist did not. There were no complications either during or after these procedures. It is possible to make open surgeries wearing a night vision system. Further approaches should be tested with human volunteers. © Virtua l Reality Medical Institute.

%X This study looks at how public health nurses and clients of maternal and child welfare clinics evaluate the function and meaning of home visits. Another concern is with the options available to the service user. The data were collected during November and December 1992 from a total of 203 health centres across Finland; responses were obtained from 263 public health nurses and 323 clients. The results are presented in the form of frequencies, percentages and cross tabulations. According to the results, the clients felt that the most important function of home visits was to have a competent professional examination of the newborn. They also attached much importance to the information function, i.e. learning about the growth and care of small children. The public health nurses, on the other hand, felt that the most important function of home visits was to support and encourage parents and to ensure the continuity of care. The advantages of meeting in the client's home environment were equally stressed by both sides. By contrast, clients and public health nurses had very different views on the options available to the client. Almost all nurses said that the client can freely choose between home visits and visiting the clinic; however, only about half the clients felt they could choose the service they best preferred.

%X Background: Although efficient treatment is available for heart failure (HF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, delayed diagnosis of pending clinical aggravation contributes to maintain mortality and hospitalisation rates at excessively high levels. The interest in telemedicine, as a way of providing faster and more appropriate care, has been stimulated by the rising costs of hospital treatment, the rapid advances in technology, and the wider availability of low-cost, patient-friendly equipment. A very limited number of randomised trials (5) totalising 807 patients compared various clinical outcomes of telemonitored HF patients with those receiving usual care. Although a favourable trend was observed on mortality and the rate of hospitalisation, these results remain to be confirmed by more rigorously designed trials as the impact of telemonitoring vital signs on decisions for intervention has not been studied, when one should consider this as a preliminary step in assessing the clinical value of the whole strategy. Methods: The BELGIUM-HF Registry is designed to identify predictors of clinical outcomes using noninvasive home-based telemonitoring. Signal trends based on weight, blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate, will be processed into patterns relevant to the end-point events (mortality, rehospitalisation, urgent visit with intervention). Such templates could not only provide valuable information on the physiopathology of HF recurrences, but could later automatically assist the monitoring system, trigger alarms and contribute to lower the complications of HF by early and appropriate interventions. The latter will be tested in a subsequent randomised double-blinded trial (BELGIUM-HF Trial). By involving the General Practitioner, the patient's environment for providing usual care remains unchanged. This choice was also made to relieve the cardiologist, who appeared quickly overloaded by the amount of monitoring data. The registry is enrolling all opportunist patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, hospitalisation for HF in the last 6 months and need of loop diuretics in the last 2 weeks. The inclusion has started and patients are completing daily blind measurements of weight, blood pressure and pulse rate during 3 to 6 months using a dedicated telemonitoring platform (VitalCare®, Vitalsys, Brussels). Results are automatically transferred through a dedicated portable phone to a central processor for storage, and are further processed for signal analysis. At the call center, a nurse is dedicated to solve technical problems, to assist the patients in training on the capture of measurements and to supervise patient's compliance. Results: 18 patients have been included totalling 1848 telemonitoring days so far. Baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects are as follows (meanSD): age 7611 years, LVEF 308%, BNP 11451228 pg/ml and NT-proBNP 20741171 pg/ml. The compliance rate, defined as the ratio of obtained and expected measurements, is high (91% and 92% for BP/pulse rate and weight recordings respectively). 2 patients (11%) suspended telemonitoring before the expected 3 months. Need for technical interventions is low (0.08 patient/month) and consisting mostly of battery replacements. One patient is also recording parameters from abroad. Conclusions: The BELGIUM-HF Registry is an innovating concept designed to identify predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure using non-invasive home telemonitoring. Initial experience shows that it is feasible with a high rate of compliance, even in older patients, a low rate of technical interventions, and data being transmitted from abroad.

%X Pressure ulcers (PrU) are considered as one of the most challenging problems that Nursing professionals have to deal with in their daily practice. Nowadays, the education on PrUs is mainly based on traditional lecturing, seminars and face-to-face instruction, sometimes with the support of photographs of wounds being used as teaching material. This traditional educational methodology suffers from some important limitations, which could affect the efficacy of the learning process. This current study has been designed to introduce information and communication technologies (ICT) in the education on PrU for undergraduate students, with the main objective of evaluating the advantages an disadvantages of using ICT, by comparing the learning results obtained from using an e-learning tool with those from a traditional teaching methodology. In order to meet this major objective, a web-based learning system named ePULab has been designed and developed as an adaptive e-learning tool for the autonomous acquisition of knowledge on PrU evaluation. This innovative system has been validated by means of a randomized controlled trial that compares its learning efficacy with that from a control group receiving a traditional face-to-face instruction. Students using ePULab gave significantly better (p < 0.01) learning acquisition scores (from pre-test mean 8.27 (SD 1.39) to post-test mean 15.83 (SD 2.52)) than those following traditional lecture-style classes (from pre-test mean 8.23 (SD 1.23) to post-test mean 11.6 (SD 2.52)). In this article, the ePULab software is described in detail and the results from that experimental educational validation study are also presented and analyzed. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X Purpose: A virtual reality application might be a promising tool to increase exercise in the homes of patients with Heart failure (HF). However, the feasibility to use an exergame for elderly heart failure patients, from patient and provider perspective is currently not known. We therefore aim to assess the feasibility to increase daily activity in HF patients using the Wii game console. Method: A descriptive study design will be used. Nintendo Wii sport will be used by 10 patients with HF for a pilot study and additionally 40 patients after the pilot. Intervention: Nintendo Wii sport will be installed in the home of 10 heart failure patients for a period of 3 months. A personalized exercise plan will be made with the patient for 10 weeks by a physiotherapist or nurse. An instructor will help the patient to install and set up the program, to make a training plan and to help the patient to use the system. Data collection: At baseline, at 3 and 6 months data will be collected on self care behavior, heart failure knowledge, exercise self-efficacy, exercise motivation and depression and anxiety. During the use of the Wii computer patients fill in a diary which contains questions about heart failure symptom monitoring, global well-being, perceived exertion and daily activity. At 3 and 6 months a qualitative interview will be conducted to assess the feasibility of using the Wii computer. Patients will also use activity monitors (SenseWear and Active Life) to assess the total daily activity. Actual use, problems and questions to the instructor will also be assessed. Results: The first patient is recruited for the study and preliminary data are planned to be available during the conference. Conclusion: This study will provide insight on the feasibly to apply virtual reality application in HF patients to increase their physical activity in their home.

%X Introduction: While recent studies show distraction is beneficial, the immersive qualities of virtual reality (VR) may provide additional benefit on management of distress and pain during burn wound care. This study examines the comparison of VR application to standard distraction techniques on an inpatient pediatric burn unit. Methods: Newly admitted burn patients, ages 7-18 without face or head burns, were recruited over a 4-year period. Consent and assent were obtained prior to first dressing change. State/ Trait Anxiety Scale (STAIC) was administered prior to dressing change. Patients were randomly assigned to VR or standard care. Children in the VR group used a headset containing the VR program during initial dressing change. The standard care group received traditional forms of distraction (ex: TV, talking). Pain and distress ratings from patients, parents, and nursing staffwere recorded pre and post wound cleansing using the Faces/VAS and FLACC scales. Results: Forty children (28 males, 12 females, M AGE = 10.3 years) completed the protocol; twenty children were randomized to VR. Twenty-three percent of patients had premorbid behavioral diagnoses. Results suggest participants in the control group reported higher post-procedure pain ratings compared to the VR group, although this was not significant (t = 1.17, p = .25). Age of participant was correlated with pain ratings (r = .36, p <.05). Groups did not significantly differ in age. While parent and nursing report indicated a higher degree of pain when compared to child report ((t = 3.5, p = .01) and (t = 1.66, p = .10), respectively) these ratings were not significantly different between treatment groups. Pain ratings were not correlated with TBSA or premorbid behavioral diagnosis. Participants demonstrated greater state anxiety than trait anxiety across conditions (t = 18.73, p = .00). Conclusions: While older patients appear to have more difficulties with pain management, application of VR during dressing changes did not lead to significant differences in reported pain levels. TBSA and premorbid behavior diagnoses did not appear to be predictors of pt's level of pain. Interestingly, both nursing staffand parents endorse an increase in pain ratings, suggesting a discrepancy between ratings and pain report assessed among the three groups. Future studies should include a larger sample size so mediating factors such as age, type of dressing, and state anxiety level could be considered. In addition, recent advances in interactive technology may provide additional benefits. Applicability of Research to Practice: While anecdotal evidence suggests benefits of VR during painful medical procedures, statistics suggest other forms of distraction may be as beneficial.

%X Background: There is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis (MS). Four stakeholders play a major role in MS: healthcare professionals, regulators, payers and patients. Objective: In Europe, patients are represented by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform (EMSP), which aims to improve MS management and patients' quality of life. Results: The EMSP has recently shown that there are major disparities in Europe in terms of access to care and treatment. Implementing the Code of Good Practice and a standardised MS nurse training may be useful in harmonising MS management across Europe. Additionally, the burden for novel therapeutic options to be approved by regulatory agencies has to decrease in order to provide faster access of treatment to patients. Data collection (e.g. national registers) also appears crucial to help research and shape the most effective policy in each country. Finally, people with MS should get appropriate (financial) support in order to complete their studies and find a job, as their active participation in society requires proper access to education and employment. Moreover, as they are the ones affected by MS, they seem to be best placed to represent themselves and their needs and should be consulted more often during decision-making processes by policy makers, regulators and payers.

%X INTRODUCTION. The continuous development of EBN/EBM and technical advancements evolves in high speed. Continuous training is therefore needed to maintain knowledge and skills to ensure the performance of the best and safest possible (nursing) care. But there are some drawbacks: Educational programs are time and money consuming and can conflict with production targets, it can be difficult to determine the educational focus and educational institutes can be rigid. At VU University medical center (VUmc) ICU educational programs are self driven and organized. The VUmc ICU is a 24 bed level 3 ward. 85 Fte/115 nurses and 14 Fte/18 ICU nursing students are deployed. METHODS. Educational programs are determined by the ICU educational focus group where doctors, nurses and nurse education managers are joined. This group defines the necessity of educational goals. Various teams offer a variety of educational topics to all nurses and are led by senior nurses or educators. Educational program overview: • Hard skills: ALS training and teaching and testing of technical skills which are led by a skills-assessor. Assessor sessions are performed at the ward during shifts. Only the assessors (8) are not scheduled for patient care. • Soft skills: simulation based training (CRM/TRM) at the ICU simulation center where non technical skills are performed and assessed. • E learning: modules that are selected or developed for direct benefit of the ICU nursing staff. Only 25 % of necessary educational training is offered outside of the ICU. Trainers and trainees are scheduled on weekly or monthly basis. Trainees are scheduled mostly during the peaceful part of shifts or after shift handoffs. The designated trainers are at least educated by Train the trainer programs or external if needed. As part of the educational climate the trainers are skilled and stimulated to be encouraging to their colleagues to cooperate in the facilitated training programs. RESULTS. Since 2011 the educational performance increased for all educational programs although the invested time did not increase in the same rate. The impact of the educational programs on regular ICU performance and logistics is minimal despite an average ICU occupancy rate off 85 % with a 1:1,5 nurse to patient ratio. There is little disturbance in attending educational sessions. CONCLUSIONS. At the VUmc ICU educational programs are mostly self driven and performed effectively. Increasing numbers of nurses are trained with almost no impact on ward care processes and logistics. This format provides flexibility and speed concerning optional choices, educational scheduling and educational capacity. Besides the mentioned advantages and outcomes we notice positive side effects as increased attention for education and quality, increased trainers and trainees motivation and the full use of nursing skills and potential by offering extra challenges1.

Performance of actual phlebotomy on a live client was assessed after training, using a standardized form. Findings showed that students who were exposed to the virtual reality simulator performed better in the following performance metrics: pain factor, hematoma formation, and number of reinsertions. This study confirms that the use of the virtual reality-based system to supplement the traditional method may be the optimal program for training. Copyright © 2013 Infusion Nurses Society.

%X Rapid adoption of disease management has outpaced systematic evaluation of its net value in improving health outcomes and mitigating healthcare cost. This article identifies areas in which outcomes research in disease management is needed to demonstrate its value or to enhance its performance. Patient identification for disease management relies on administrative database queries but the trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of alternative queries are not well known. Large-scale deployment, rapid patient engagement, and repeated interactions between patients and nurses could be important attributes for attaining measurable improvements in quality and cost reduction over short periods of time, but these hypothesis need to be tested. There is a trend toward integration of multiple chronic disease management programs onto a single platform. To support this trend, there is a need for a corresponding set of integrated clinical guidelines or "meta-guidelines" that combine the contents of individual practice guidelines. The relative contribution of various disease management interventions in improving clinical results, lowering costs, and their respective ease of implementation is not known. Research leading to a better understanding of tradeoffs could lead to more rational resource allocation and better overall outcomes. Coordination between disease management programs and physician practices is lacking. Research aimed at defining operational and technical interfaces and cultural and behavioral professional adjustments necessary to achieve integration and coordination is needed. The lack of a consistent analytical framework for evaluating clinical and financial outcomes has made comparisons of reported results impossible and has rendered many reports unreliable. Theoretical work on a standard methodology that integrates clinical and financial outcomes and empiric validation is needed.

%X The learning environment provides crucial exposure for the pre-registration nursing student. It is during this time that the student nurse develops his or her repertoire of skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in order to meet competencies and gain registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The role of the mentor is vital within the learning environment for aspiring nurses. The learning environment is a fundamental platform for student learning, with mentors key to identifying what is conducive to learning. This article will consider the learning environment and learning styles, and how these two essential elements guide the mentor in making sure they are conducive to learning.

%X Background: Elder abuse (EA) is an underrecognized problem which causes increased morbidity and mortality. EA is defined as a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any trust relationship, which causes harm or risk of harm to an older person. Despite mandatory reporting laws, physicians are believed to report only about 1% of all cases of EA. Studies show that lack of education is often cited as a primary cause of failure to identify and report EA. Methodology: A 6 step methodology proposed by DKern was utilized to develop a curriculum for EA at the Durham VAMC using evidence based guidelines and best practice. Components of the educational curriculum included: definition, types, risk factors and the reporting process of EA. The curriculum was developed as a 60 minute, multimedia case based interactive lecture geared towards medical residents, physicians, and other healthcare providers who routinely care for elders. The curriculum was tested with a pre-and post -test assessment for a variety of different core competencies and post testing focus groups. Results: There were a total of 86 participants, representing social work, physical/occupational therapy, nursing, geriatricians, and learners. Pre-post testing revealed improvement in knowledge among respondents in a variety of areas. For example, there was a significant increase in participant ability to recognize all types of abuse, 7/86(8.1%) to 20/86(23.2%) as well as a significant increase in ability to identify sexual abuse as a type of EA, 15/86(17.4%) to 27/86(31.4%). Additional scores for questions regarding the reporting process and ability to identify reporting agencies also improved. Focus group responses among participants suggested the curriculum was effective at increasing awareness of EA. Furthermore, respondents felt more comfortable with identifying, diagnosing and reporting EA. Conclusion: We developed a one hour curriculum on EA that has since been reproduced in CD form and as an interactive webinar. We believe this curriculum, if implemented among health care professionals and staff with frequent exposure to elderly patients, has the potential to improve knowledge and recognition of this serious concern. Continued analysis of this curriculum is ongoing.

%X Nursing education is challenged to prepare students for complex healthcare needs through the integration of teamwork and informatics. Technology has become an important teaching tool in the blended classroom to enhance group based learning experiences. Faculty evaluation of classroom technologies is imperative prior to adoption. Few studies have directly compared various technologies and their impact on student satisfaction and learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate technology enhanced teaching methods on the learning and satisfaction of graduate students in an advanced pharmacology class using an unfolding case study. After IRB approval, students were randomly assigned to one of three groups: blogging group, wiki group or webinar group. Students completed the evolving case study using the assigned interactive technology. Student names were removed from the case studies. Faculty evaluated the case study using a rubric, while blinded to the assigned technology method used. No significant difference was found on case study grades, the range of grades on the assignment demonstrated little differences between the methods used. Students indicated an overall positive impact related to networking and collaboration on a satisfaction survey. Impact of technology methods needs to be explored in other areas of graduate nursing education.

%X Proteomic differences between rat dams and control mothers deprived of their pups immediately after delivery were investigated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).A 2-D DIGE minimal dye technique combined with LC-MS/MS identified 32 different proteins that showed significant changes in expression in the mPFC, of which, 25 were upregulated and 7 were downregulated in dams. The identity of one significantly increased protein, the small heat-shock protein alpha-crystallin B chain (Cryab), was confirmed via Western blot analysis. Alpha-crystallin B chain was distributed in scattered cells in the mPFC, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, it was found to be localized in parvalbumin-containing neurons using double labeling. The elevation of its mRNA level in rat dams was also demonstrated via RT-PCR.The functional classification of the altered proteins was conducted using the UniProt and Gene Ontology protein databases. The identified proteins predominantly participate in synaptic transport and plasticity, neuron development, oxidative stress and apoptosis, and cytoskeleton organization. A common regulator and target analysis of these proteins determined using the Elsevier Pathway Studio Platform suggests that protein level changes associated with pup nursing are driven by growth factors and cytokines, while the MAP kinase pathway was identified as a common target. A high proportion of the proteins that were found to be altered in the mPFC are associated with depression. Biological significance: The behavior and emotional state of females change robustly when they become mothers. The brain, which governs these changes, may also undergo molecular alterations in mothers. As no proteomics approaches have been applied regarding maternal changes in the brain, we addressed this issue in the mPFC as this brain area is the uppermost cortical center of maternal control and the associated mood changes. The high number of protein-level alterations found between mothers taking care of their litter and those without pups indicates that pup nursing is associated with cortical protein-level changes. Alterations in proteins participating in synaptic transport, plasticity and neuron development suggest neuroplastic changes in the maternal brain. In turn, the relatively high number of altered proteins in the mPFC associated with depression suggests that the physiological effects of the protein-level alterations in the maternal mPFC could promote the incidence of postpartum depression. Cryab, a protein confirmed to be increased during maternal behaviors, was selectively found in parvalbumin cells, which, as fast-spiking interneurons, are associated with depression. The function of Cryab should be further investigated to establish whether it can be used to identify drug targets for future drug development.

%X Background and Aim: Terumo BCT announced to stop their support for the Cobe Spectra platform in the Netherlands in 2014. To achieve the CD34+ve cells in our JACIE/FACT accredited institution for autologous stem cell transplants, we decided to validate the Spectra Optia (Terumo BCT). Data achieved from CD34 collections with Cobe Spectra, or the literature were used for comparison. Methods and Materials: In the period February-December 2013, CD34 apheresis collection procedures were performed by certified apheresis nurses with Spectra Optia in combination with disposable 10110. Various parameters from donors (TBV, CD34 precount, WBC, Plt, and Hct pre-/postcount), procedure (Time, blood volume processed, side effects), and product (volume, CD34 cell count, Plt, WBC, RBCs, Hb/Hct) were collected. The collection efficiency (CE1) was calculated based on the results. Results: In 11 months, 45 procedures in 33 autologous donors (14 women and 19 men) were performed. In a mean procedure time of 258 min, 12,100 ml of the donors' blood was processed, with a mean platelet loss of 27% in the donor. A mean CE1 to collect the CD34+ve cells of 56% was achieved. The mean results of the collected component are given in the table. In one of the procedures, the collection was stopped prematurely due to flow problems. The next day, a procedure was performed without any problems. In 17/45 (38%) of the procedures side effects were noticed, of which 16/17 (94%) due to the citrate reinfusion. All these were solved by oral or i.v. calcium admission. The remainder side effect observed was a headache in the donor that was solved by the admission of acetaminophen. Discussion: In 2012, in our hands, in 43% of the Cobe Spectra procedures citrate effects were observed. Although somewhat less with Spectra Optia (36%), this wasn't significant. Compared to the literature, a reasonable platelet loss of 27% in the donor is seen (7-47%). The CE1 of the Spectra Optia was 56% (literature 47-56%; Reinhardt, Transfusion 2011; Rox, Vox Sang 2011, Flommersfeldt, TRASCI 2013) and compared with Cobe Spectra significantly higher (41%; P < 0.0001). Collecting the same number of CD34+ve cells/kg, the procedure time was significantly longer with Spectra Optia (258 vs 177 min; P < 0.0001). Compared to the literature, the hematocrit of the collected component is relatively high (0.07 L/L vs 0.015 L/L; Reinhardt, Transfusion 2011).(table present) Conclusions: The Spectra Optia is useful in the collection of CD34+ve cells for autologous stem cell transplant with a low platelet loss in the donor. The machine has a significant higher CE1, compared to Cobe Spectra, but the procedure time is considerably longer. In our hands, we didn't see a difference in side effects in the donors during and after the apheresis procedure.

%X The global shortage of sufficiently skilled health workers will only grow under the infuence of the aging population, also within the Belgian society. Can migration of medical personnel be part of the solution? The European project "Health workers for all, all for health workers" aims to raise awareness among the different stakeholders and promote a dialogue. Through the exchange of information and experiences, the way for an ethical code regarding the international recruitment of medical personnel can be prepared. The project is implemented in eight European countries, with financial support from the European Union. For Belgium, Memisa, the non-governmental organization (ngo) for medical cooperation, has accepted this challenge. Migration can be part of the solution if sufficient medical personnel can answer the needs of the own population. Although Belgium has never had a proactive recruitment policy for medical personnel abroad, the recent phenomenon to recruit in Southern European countries which are in crisis, raises some questions. Several initiatives in Belgium, like the campaign launched by the ambassador of care Lon Holtzer to promote the inflow towards training institutes for nurses, the charter from the Belgian platform for international health "Be-cause Health" on the recruitment of foreign medical personnel and Memisa's "Hospital for Hospital" twinning program, are examples of initiatives to raise a more common understanding and awareness. Everybody, everywhere, has the right to benefit from good medical care, now and in the future.

%X Aims Electronic health support (e-health) may improve self-care of patients with heart failure (HF). We aim to assess whether an adjusted care pathway with replacement of routine consultations by e-health improves self-care as compared with usual care. In addition, we will determine whether the ESC/HFA (European Society of Cardiology/Heart Failure Association) website heartfailurematters.org (HFM website) improves self-care when added to usual care. Finally, we aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Methods A three-arm parallel randomized trial will be conducted. Arm 1 consists of usual care; arm 2 consists of usual care plus the HFM website; and arm 3 is the adjusted care pathway with an interactive platform for disease management (e-Vita platform), with a link to the HFM website, which replaces routine consultations with HF nurses at the outpatient clinic. In total, 414 patients managed in 10 Dutch HF outpatient clinics or in general practice will be included and followed for 12 months. Participants are included if they have had an established diagnosis of HF for at least 3 months. The primary outcome is self-care as measured by the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScB scale). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, cardiovascular- and HF-related mortality, hospitalization, and its duration as captured by hospital and general practitioner registries, use of and user satisfaction with the HFM website, and cost-effectiveness. Perspective This study will provide important prospective data on the impact and cost-effectiveness of an interactive platform for disease management and the HFM website.

%X Background: Electronic health support (e-health) may improve quality of life (QoL) and self care of patients with heart failure (HF). We aim to assess whether an adjusted care pathway with replacement of routine consultations by e-health improves self care and QoL compared to usual care. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of the heartfailurematters.org (HFM website) improves patient outcomes compared to usual care. Methods: A three-arm parallel randomised trial. Arm 1 consists of usual care; arm 2 is usual care plus the HFM website; and arm 3 is the adjusted care pathway with an interactive platform for disease management and a link to the HFM website, replacing routine consultations with HF nurses. In total, 750 patients enlisted in ten Dutch HF outpatient clinics or from general practices in the vicinity will be included and followed up for 12 months. Participants should have an established diagnosis of HF, either with or without reduced ejection fraction for at least 3 months, receive the medication according to the current HF guidelines and have been provided with essential education. The primary outcomes will be self care and QoL measured with validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality, HF-related hospitalizations, duration of the hospitalizations, use and user satisfaction of the HFM website, and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: This study will provide important prospective data on the impact and cost-effectiveness of the HFM website, and the effect of substitution of routine face-to-face contacts by an interactive platform for disease management in HF patients.

%X Online simulation provides an alternative approach to hands-on simulation and a number of software packages are becoming available to educators. Lt™ is an online, immersive learning platform, which aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, by using real patient case studies along with interactive exercises. We introduced Lab Tutor™ software as an integral part of our year 3 clinical skills module, alongside the use of the SimMan 3G Advanced Human Patient Simulator (AHPS), with the aim of providing students with a more immersive simulation experience. Lt is now almost completely integrated into all pre-registration nursing courses within the University of the West of Scotland We introduced LabTutor™ to final year nursing students at the beginning of an 11-week clinical skills module. On completion of the module we evaluated the use of the software and whether the students considered that using the interactive software improved their knowledge of disease processes and management of patients. We evaluated results from this pilot study. Early feedback from students indicates that the introduction of LabTutor™ improved understanding of disease processes as well as their management. Following the pilot we contacted ADInstruments and worked closely with them to produce a more nurse related platform with fewer experiments and more nursing intervention We are also in the process of developing a number of patient scenarios, using existing Lt™ patients, for use on the SimMan 3G AHPS.

%X Instructor immediacy has been positively associated with many desirable academic outcomes including increased student learning. This study extends existing understanding of instructional immediacy behaviours in elearning by describing postgraduate nursing students' reflections on their own experience. An exploratory, descriptive survey design was used to collect qualitative data. Participants were asked what behaviours or activities help to create rapport or a positive interpersonal connection (immediacy) between students and their online teacher(s). Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main themes: acknowledging and affirming student's personal and professional responsibilities; providing clear and timely information; and utilising rich media. These findings give lecturers insight into instructional strategies they may adopt to increase immediacy in elearning and hence improve student learning outcomes.

%X Objective: To prepare students to address the psychosocial needs of patients with cancer and to have an understanding of the challenges faced when identifying resources within the community. Significance and Background: Cancer centers are working to meet the American College of Surgeons 2015 recommendation of psychosocial assessment and appropriate referrals. Nurses and nursing students should be in a position to deliver comprehensive services such as screening, risk assessment, prevention strategies, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and resources for patients from all backgrounds. Nursing professionals have an opportunity to help these patients connect with local resources. Through engaging oncology nurses from the surrounding areas, and nursing students with an interest in oncology, over 500 resources were identified and combined into a mobile application. Purpose: The activity was designed to increase the nursing students' awareness of the challenges a patient with cancer may face when trying to find community resources for their psychosocial needs. Resources that were identified were then used to develop a mobile application for cancer resources. Evaluation: As a result of this activity nursing students were able to identify over 500 cancer resources within the immediate community and surrounding areas. Resources were combined and categorized based on type of service, county and patient population served. Faculty then worked with students from the Computer Sciences Department to develop the mobile application. Discussion: The use of smart phones or similar devices will allow the healthcare provider to provide health information to cancer patients without leaving the chair or bed side and will allow more time for education and interaction with patients. This platform gives the nurse and provider an opportunity to meet patient needs, meet ACOS recommendations, and remain efficient in their day to day practice.

%X Webinar-based learning is becoming increasingly utilized to facilitate continuous medical education. As part of a dermatology webinar series provided by us to general practitioners (GPs), we sought to create a dermatology cloud, called 'DermCloud', with multiple resources online (e.g. lecture slides, recorded lectures, reference literature and website links) and continuous engagement throughout the course via social networking. E-learning modules included six weekly lectures on medical dermatology, as well as a module on paediatric dermatology. AdobeConnect® software (Adobe, Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.) enabled attendees to attend from a PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone. Supporting study materials were made accessible via Dropbox® (San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.). Users were encouraged to present anonymized cases for discussion, and an online multiple-choice questionnaire was provided on conclusion of the module. Facebook and Twitter, and a blog on the website were used as forms of continuous interaction with students. Participants were surveyed at baseline utilizing SurveyMonkey® (Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.) to examine motivation for undertaking the module. During the module, observation logs were made on attendance and host-learner interactions. A further survey and a focus group session were conducted to ascertain user satisfaction following module completion. Seventy participants, consisting of three medical students, one dermatology nurse, five dermatology nonconsultant hospital doctors, five GP trainees and 56 GPs, enrolled in the initial module. Fifty-five per cent were based in an urban location. Fifty-eight per cent would not have enrolled if it was not online. Thirty-five participants responded to the postmodule survey. Eighty-three per cent felt that their computer skills were totally sufficient for the course. Participants' overall rating of the module was 4 out of 5, with most feeling their objectives had been met. After website search, Facebook was the second highest referrer to our website. DermCloud currently has 229 followers on Twitter. While module set-up was challenging, with difficulties encountered in website design, tracking participants' interactions and software glitches necessitating a dedicated technology manager, most participants found the module technically easy to access and interact with. Having all elements of the course online and accessible on multiple devices was particularly appealing. Continued relations with the participants via social media has proved helpful in engaging GPs with dermatology education. We hope that Derm- Cloud has created a new expanding community of practitioners interested in improving their knowledge of dermatology.

%X Objective: Little is known about the barriers, facilitators and interventions that impact on systematic review uptake. The objective of this study was to identify how uptake of systematic reviews can be improved. Selection criteria: Studies were included if they addressed interventions enhancing the uptake of systematic reviews. Reports in any language were included. All decisionmakers were eligible. Studies could be randomised trials, cluster-randomised trials, controlled-clinical trials and before-and-after studies. Data sources: We searched 19 databases including PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, covering the full range of publication years from inception to December 2010. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality according to the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care criteria. Results: 10 studies from 11 countries, containing 12 interventions met our criteria. Settings included a hospital, a government department and a medical school. Doctors, nurses, mid-wives, patients and programme managers were targeted. Six of the studies were geared to improving knowledge and attitudes while four targeted clinical practice. Synthesis of results: Three studies of low-to-moderate risk of bias, identified interventions that showed a statistically significant improvement: educational visits, short summaries of systematic reviews and targeted messaging. Promising interventions include e-learning, computer-based learning, inactive workshops, use of knowledge brokers and an e-registry of reviews. Juxtaposing barriers and facilitators alongside the identified interventions, it was clear that the three effective approaches addressed a wide range of barriers and facilitators. Discussion: A limited number of studies were found for inclusion. However, the extensive literature search is one of the strengths of this review. Conclusions: Targeted messaging, educational visits and summaries are recommended to enhance systematic review uptake. Identified promising approaches need to be developed further. New strategies are required to encompass neglected barriers and facilitators. This review addressed effectiveness and also appropriateness of knowledge uptake strategies.

%X The expanding population of older adults living in rural communities presents a rich opportunity for new clinical experiences for nursing students. The purpose of this research study was to explore the experiences of nursing students working with older adults in rural communities, the experiences of older adults, and the development of relationships. The sample included 96 nursing students and 16 older adults. Using the phenomenological method, we solicited comprehensive descriptions through open-ended questions. The following themes describe the experience of nursing students and the older adults they visited in their homes: (a) Welcoming Presence, (b) Developing a Trusting Relationship, (c) Spending Time Together, (d) Sharing and Listening to Stories, (e) Learning about Growing Old, and (f) Growing Nursing Students. Students believed that this experience was a vital component of their nursing education and it taught them how to develop a therapeutic relationship, learn how to listen, and how to be comfortable with themselves in the role of the student nurse. Students felt that the home setting was a safe environment to learn how to listen, carry out assessments, and receive feedback from older adults. This clinical experience can be easily implemented in a nursing curriculum to better prepare nurses for the challenges of the future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

%X Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. Caring for children with ALL is an uncommon experience for parents without medical training. They urgently need professional assistance when their children are recovering at home. This paper documents the process of developing an Android application (app) "Care Assistant" for family caregivers of children with ALL. Key informant interviews and focus group studies were used before programming the app. The key informants and focus group members included: caregivers of children with ALL, cancer care physicians and nurses, and software engineers. We found several major challenges faced by caregivers: limited access to evidence-based clinic information, lack of financial and social assistance, deficient communications with doctors or nurses, lack of disease-related knowledge, and inconvenience of tracking treatments and testing results. This feedback was used to develop "Care Assistant". This app has eight modules: personal information, treatment tracking, family care, financial and social assistance, knowledge centre, self-assessment questionnaires, interactive platform, and reminders. We have also developed a web-based administration portal to manage the app. The usability and effectiveness of "Care Assistant" will be evaluated in future studies.

%X Objective To investigate the distribution of human resources in primary healthcare system of Xinjin county in Chengdu in 2010, so as to provide the evidence for appropriate allocation of health manpower. Methods We collected the data of human resources in the regional health information and management platform, and the list of health workers and their registration information. Microsoft Excel 2003 and SPSS 13.0 software were used to analyze data. Results a) A total of 1 551 health workers were in Xinjin primary healthcare system in 2010, including 1 124 in tenure position (accounting for 72.5%) and 427 in contract (accounting for 27.5%). b) In county-level hospital (CLH) or community healthcare centre (CHC) or township hospital (TH), the proportion of health professionals were 83.2%, 79.0% and 80.0% respectively; and 28.8%, 27.2% and 28.7% for registered & assistant doctors; 39.3%, 22.7% and 16.2% for registered nurses; 6.7%, 8.3% and 4.7% for technicians; and 5.9%, 6.8% and 6.9% for pharmacists, respectively. c) Health personnel per 1 000 population in CLH, CHC, and TH were 3.10, 1.98, and 1.92, respectively; health professionals per 1 000 population were 2.58, 1.58, and 1.54, respectively; registered & assistant doctors per 1 000 population were 0.89, 0.54, 0.55, respectively; and registered nurses were 1.22, 0.45, 0.31, respectively. The nurse-to-doctor ratios were 1.36, 0.83, and 0.56 nurses per doctor in CLH, CHC, and TH, respectively. The bed-to-nurse ratios were 0.59, 0.38, and 0.19 nurses per bed respectively. d) Most health professionals were junior professionals (about 60%), in college-level education (about 50%), between 25 to 44 years old (20%-70%), work experience between 5 to 19 years (40%-63%). e) Temporary employees in TH accounted for 46.4%, among which 86.6% younger than 35 years old, 23.4% in internship, and 64.1% at clinical position. Conclusion a) The shortage of health personnel is very obvious in Xinjin county with inappropriate proportions of health professionals; b) The stability of health personnel is challenging due to the large proportion of temporary employees in THs; c) health professionals in Xinjin county features a younger population, and in lower professional positions; d)Therefore, the related policies should be adjusted and innovated to enhance the education and training, to maintain the stability of health personnel and to promote the healthy and sustainable development of primary healthcare services. © 2014 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

%X Objective: To assess the challenges to and provide a response strategy for the development of nursing and make suggestions for promoting the nursing discipline, platform, and talent teams based on current best available evidence. Methods: We searched CNKI(China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP information(Chinese Scientific Journals database), CBM(Chinese Biomedical Literature database), and Web sites of the World Health Organization, International Council of Nurses, World Bank, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education of China, and relevant schools in China. Data analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0. Results: We identified 886 nursing schools in China in 2012. Results showed that 38,212 nursing students were enrolled in universities or independent colleges and 130,837 nursing student were enrolled in colleges or senior vocational schools. The doctor-to-nurse ratio was 1:0.9 in 2010. The actual demand for doctors was 2.6 million, whereas the nursing shortage was approximately 346,000. Nurses aged ≤35 years accounted for 50% of the total. A total of 64% to 69% of nurses had primary professional titles; fewer than 2.5% of those had advanced titles. The training costs for one doctor or one nurse in China was only two-fifths that in India and one-fifth to one-fourth that in sub-Saharan Africa. To date, only 30.1% of disaster nursing studies in China provided research data; 30.6% were related to clinical experience and 38.3% were reviews. Conclusions: Education and health systems need to be extensively reformed. It is necessary to train nursing students with core competencies using transformative learning. It is necessary to update textbooks and teaching methods, and funding should be appropriately increased. Nursing should co-operate with other disciplines, and apply evidence-based nursing methods to improve the quality of healthcare services and patient satisfaction. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University.

%X Aims: It is acknowledged that the quality of diabetes care varies considerably across health professionals. The Cambridge Diabetes Education Programme (CDEP) has been established to develop accessible health professional education that increases diabetes management knowledge and skills leading to improvements in the care of people with diabetes. Methods: CDEP is a unique web based platform which enables the learner to work through a series of diabetes related competencies defined by the national nursing, dietetic and/or podiatry competency frameworks. Learning is based upon an adapted plando- study-assess approach which includes multiple choice ques-tions, linkages to national learning resources and the provision of accredited certificates once a topic is completed. The programme underwent seven pilots and has a structured approach to development, testing and launch. Evaluation of the programme is undertaken through the learner completing an evaluation prior to obtaining a certificate. Results: Currently, 11 competency topics have been released up to the level of unregistered and non-diabetes specialist professionals; a further six topics are in development. 1,137 learners have registered with CDEP of whom 45% are from hospital trusts, 44% from primary care and the remaining from community services, nursing homes etc. 1,408 certificates have been awarded to date. Overall, 79% have reported an improvement in competency, familiarity and/or confidence ranging from 57% for promoting self-care to 93% for the nutrition and physical activity topic. Conclusions: An electronic educational programme that defines knowledge aspects of competency is possible and is associated with learner perceptions of improved ability across different disciplines. Implementation of national diabetes competency frameworks is now systematically possible.

%X BACKGROUND: Multihospital healthcare system leaders and individual nurses are challenged to integrate standardized evidence-based practices that support continuous performance improvement in their systems. AIM: This study was undertaken to evaluate the strength of and the opportunities for implementing evidence-based nursing practice across a diverse 9-hospital system located in the mid-Atlantic region. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 6,800 registered nurses (RNs), with a 24% response rate, was conducted to learn about their attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward organizational readiness and implementation of EBP. RESULTS: Although respondents' beliefs about EBP were positive, they reported their ability to implement EBP as extremely low. More than one third (36%) of the respondents worked at two of the system's Magnet designated hospitals. Magnet RNs reported more resources and held more positive beliefs about their hospital's organizational readiness for EBP. Nurses who possess advanced nursing degrees, certification, and who serve in leadership roles were favorable toward EBP. Younger RNs with fewer years in practice were more likely to have positive beliefs toward EBP and embedding it into the organizational culture. LINKING EVIDENCE TO PRACTICE: Findings mirror previous research where nurses internationally favor EBP yet struggle with similar barriers for implementation. Strategies to link this evidence to action can be taken at local and global levels. Locally, transformational nurse leaders within each hospital can share the vision for implementing EBP and embrace Magnet principles. At the system level, transformational nurse leaders can collectively allocate resources to create a system-wide online EBP education plan with EBP competencies and tool kit to increase RN exposure to EBP and standardize practice. Globally, promoting free and accessible EBP massive open online courses (MOOC) and sharing best practices online and at international forums such as Magnet conferences will help to lead, educate, and mentor nurses with strategies to systematically increase EBP uptake.

%X Purpose: Many dialysis providers have insufficient kidney transplant (KTX) knowledge and education materials to help their patients learn about KTX. Inperson (live) Explore Transplant (ET) trainings were shown to improve providers' KTX knowledge and education practices, but many providers cannot attend a live training due to location or patient care loads. We created a second training delivery approach, E-learning training, and assessed its equivalence (non-inferiority) to live trainings in improving providers' KTX knowledge, motivation to educate patients about KTX, and actual education practices 6 months later. Methods: From 2011-2013, dialysis providers in 14 ESRD Networks participated in either ET live and E-learning trainings. The E-learning program offered identical content to the live trainings, but was administered in four, one-hour online sessions. Providers were surveyed directly before and after the trainings, then 6 months later, to assess improvement in their KTX knowledge, plans to educate their patients, and their KTX education practices. Pairs of providers, one from each delivery type, were matched by ESRD Network and job title. Equivalence across educational delivery approaches was defined as < 15% worse outcomes (i.e., 1.8 pts difference in knowledge change on 12 pt knowledge scale or rate ratio lower bound of 0.85). Results: 280 matched pairs (27% social workers, 34% nurses, 39% others) were created from providers participating in the live (n=1485) or E-learning trainings (n=308). E-learning was equivalent to live trainings at increasing providers' KTX knowledge and motivation to educate 1 patient but not at motivating providers to commit to educating 5 patients and doing this 6 months later (Table). Discussion: While a cost-effective, widely disseminable ET E-learning training was shown to be equivalent to live trainings in increasing dialysis providers' KTX knowledge and motivation to start educating about KTX, follow-up by email or phone may be necessary to reinforce E-learning attendees to actively engage in new KTX education. (Table Presented).

%X Poor adherence to therapy is a significant healthcare issue, particularly in patients with chronic disease such as open-angle glaucoma. Treatment failure may necessitate unwarranted changes of medications, increased healthcare expenditure and risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required. Simplifying eye drop regimes, providing adequate information, teaching drop instillation technique and ongoing support according to the patient need may have a positive effect on improving adherence. To summarise the effects of interventions for improving adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy in people with ocular hypertension (OHT) or glaucoma. We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 6), MEDLINE (June 1946 to June 2012), EMBASE (June 1980 to June 2012), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (June 1937 to June 2012), PsycINFO (1806 to June 2012), PsycEXTRA (1908 to June 2012), Web of Science (1970 to June 2012), ZETOC (1993 to June 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 26 June 2012. We did not search the National Research Register (NNR) as this resource has now been now archived. We contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers to request unpublished data and searched conference proceedings for the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), and the Annual Congress for the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCO). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared interventions to improve adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy for patients with OHT or glaucoma. At least two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility and extracted data for included trials onto specifically designed forms. We did not pool data due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity. Sixteen trials (1565 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies investigated some form of patient education. In six of these studies this education was combined with other behavioural change interventions including tailoring daily routines to promote adherence to eye drops. Eight studies compared different drug regimens (one of these trials also compared open and masked monitoring) and one study investigated a reminder device. The studies were of variable quality and some were at considerable risk of bias; in general, the length of follow-up was short at less than six months with only two studies following up to 12 months. Different interventions and outcomes were reported and so it was not possible to produce an overall estimate of effect. There was some evidence from three studies that education combined with personalised interventions, that is, more complex interventions, improved adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy. There was less information on other outcomes such as persistence and intraocular pressure, and no information on visual field defects, quality of life and cost. There was weak evidence as to whether people on simpler drug regimens were more likely to adhere and persist with their ocular hypotensive therapy. A particular problem was the interpretation of cross-over studies, which in general were not reported correctly. One study investigated a reminder device and monitoring but the study was small and inconclusive. Although complex interventions consisting of patient education combined with personalised behavioural change interventions, including tailoring daily routines to promote adherence to eye drops, may improve adherence to glaucoma medication, overall there is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular intervention. The interventions varied between studies and no e of the included studies reported on the cost of the intervention. Simplified drug regimens also could be of benefit but again the current published studies do not provide conclusive evidence. Future studies should follow up for at least one year, and could benefit from standardised outcomes.

Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient
%X Background: The aim was to survey registered nurses for their level of knowledge of HIV, their self-reported attitudes towards HIV infected patients and determine associated factors. Lack of knowledge of HIV may lead to stigmatising attitudes by health care workers. Studies show stigma in health care settings lead to a decrease in uptake of HIV testing. National guidelines state that a nurse should have the competence to obtain consent and conduct an HIV test. There is little literature on the knowledge and attitude levels of registered nurses in the UK. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a sample of nurses (n = 144) in a large hospital from all clinical departments using self-completed structured anonymous questionnaires. Descriptive analysis using frequencies was used to examine demographic variables, knowledge and attitude scores and to describe the sample participants. Spearman's rho non-parametric test was used for all correlations as not all of the data was normally distributed. Non-parametric tests, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U, were used to look for associations between continuous dependent variables and the dichotomous background variables. Results: Mean age was 43.3 years. 24 countries of birth were reported. The overall mean knowledge score was 19/25,77%(Median 80 IQR 68-84). The mean attitude score was 4.06 (SD 0.45, Minimum 2.64, maximum 5), the median was 4.08 (IQR 3.76-4.40), the higher the score the more positive the attitude with undecided (3) the neutral point. Nurses who felt religion was “very important” to them had statistically significant worse attitude scores (Mdn 3.88) compared to other groups “important” (Mdn 4.40, p < 0.001), “not so important” (Mdn 4.30, p < 0.001), “not at all important” (Mdn 4.36, p < 0.001). A strong religious belief was associated with lower knowledge scores. Conclusion: The importance attribute to religious belief appears to influence attitudes toward HIV-infected people. Although overall knowledge was good and attitudes were positive those who self-identified that religion was very important to them had lower knowledge attitude scores. On-going dialogue with religious communities is essential. In addition innovative ways need to be developed to get training to those who need it, for example short in-services on the wards, train the trainer and e-learning programs.

%X An integrative review was undertaken to analyze studies published since 1998 on the use of high-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) in undergraduate nursing education. This review found that HFPS benefits nursing students in terms of knowledge, value, realism, and learner satisfaction; findings were mixed in the areas of student confidence, knowledge transfer, and stress. Further research in these and other areas will determine whether its increased use is warranted.

%X Background Paging systems continue to be used by the majority of hospitals despite the nearly ubiquitous use of personal and/or corporate smartphones by hospital clinicians. Integrated multi-platform smartphone apps, such as the Vocera® Collaboration Suite (VCS), have the potential to be a reliable, efficient, and secure methods of communication in hospitals. Objective To examine the effect of VCS, on communication and the efficiency of communication between hospital clinicians. Methods A Three-month prospective observational study was completed at two tertiary care hospitals, and one community hospital, at Island Health (Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada). Hospitalists, obstetricians, intensivists, and pharmacists piloted the VCS smartphone app in the replacement of pagers. Switchboard operators, ICU nurses, and ICU unit clerks had access to the app via a desktop computer based web console. Our primary outcome was the difference in page turnaround time before and after the implementation of VCS. We also conducted baseline and post-study surveys and measured the volume of the apps usage. Results Physicians responded to pages faster (5.5 vs 3 min; p<0.05) when using VCS compared to traditional pagers. Physicians found the app was more efficient, reduced interruptions to patient care, and 81% of physicians wanted to continue using the system. The highest reported drawback of the app was the reduction in phone battery life. Conclusions Smartphone based communication systems, such as Vocera® Collaboration Suite, improve the speed of, and satisfaction with hospital communication when compared to pagers. Reduced phone battery life should be considered when implementing VCS.

%X Introduction Human factors play an important role in adverse incidents and complaints in healthcare. Simulation is increasingly recognised as a safe and effective platform for human factors training. We propose that multiprofessional team-based simulation courses could enhance staff training, staff engagement, patient safety and patient experience in the endoscopy unit. Methods We designed and delivered four in-situ multiprofessional simulation courses for established endoscopy teams across North West London, using recent clinical incident and complaints data to inform scenario selection and debriefs. We developed learning resources including a faculty information sheet, pre and post course questionnaires, scenario descriptions and an introductory presentation. We procured an OGD and colonoscopy simulator and invited a patient actor to contribute to scenarios and debriefs. Video feedback was used to inform peer-led discussions. We collected quantitative and qualitative pre and post course data including participant demographics, and Likert scores for course enjoyment, usefulness, relevance and realism. Data was analysed descriptively. Results A total of 47 endoscopy staff participated in the courses (course size 8-15), including 32 nurse assistants, 11 endoscopists, 3 health care assistants and 1 porter. 70% were female, 55% were aged 35 to 50 and 60% had less than 5 years experience in endoscopy. Post course data analysis showed high Likert scores across all measured domains (1 poor - 5 excellent): 4.74 (enjoyment), 4.81 (usefulness), 4.80 (relevance), 4.33 (realistic). 85% felt that their confidence in managing similar situations in real life had improved. Qualitative data was universally positive, and included: “quality feedback”, “makes you reflect on better practice”, “shared learning”, and “there is a real need for courses such as this”. Conclusion Endoscopy teams value simulation based multiprofessional learning platforms for human factors training. We believe that 3 key features enhanced learning and course effectiveness: in-situ delivery of courses with established teams, empowering team members of all professional backgrounds to voice clinical concerns, and active participation with supported feedback. We believe that multiprofessional learning platforms have an important place in healthcare improvement and endoscopy teams are well placed to benefit.

%X Objectives: In order to decrease the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan, our government has incorporated chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevention and health care into the important administrative task since 2003. We hope to enhance the CKD health education, to promote screening of CKD, to provide the counseling service of CKD prevention and control, and to implement the health management on CKD patients. Methods: To correspond approximately with the concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, we implemented health education, early detection, and health management. Results: Multisector including government, professional society, medical care facilities, and community collaborate on CKD health promotion program. Primary prevention-Various media (television, radio, newspapers, Internet) are being used to conduct a series of health education. Awareness activities in response to “World Kidney Day” were implemented. Secondary prevention-Integrated community screenings for chronic diseases in adults and elderly were implemented, and followed by community health management programs. Tertiary prevention-By setting up health promotion institutions to implement the health management on CKD patients. There are medical professional teams consisting of doctors, nurses, dieticians, and other medical professionals to care patients in different medical facilities. A CKD registration system was established, which encompassed configuration of the registration platform, establishment of the registration standard flow, and construction of the registration information quality mechanism. Between 2005 and 2008, a total of 134 medical institutions participated in online registration and more than 36,399 cases completed registration. Furthermore, an integrated research of CKD prevention and control has been underway, which contains local epidemiology, therapeutic and diagnostic techniques, health care, and medical payments. Conclusions: The public health education and the further education of medical professional play an important role in conveying correct knowledge. Integrating multisectoral cooperation and settings can approach to CKD health promotion. With the interdisciplinary health management, CKD patients may receive better care.

%X BACKGROUND: Failures of communication are a major contributor to perioperative adverse events. Transitions of care may be particularly vulnerable. We sought to improve postoperative handovers. METHODS: We introduced a multimodal intervention in an adult and a pediatric postanesthesia care unit (PACU) to improve postoperative handovers between anesthesia providers (APs) and PACU registered nurses (RNs). The intervention included a standardized electronic handover report form, a didactic webinar, mandatory simulation training focused on improving interprofessional communication, and post-training performance feedback. Trained, blinded nurse observers scored PACU handovers during 17 months using a structured tool consisting of 8 subscales and a global score (1-5 scale). Multivariate logistic regression assessed the effect of the intervention on the proportion of observed handovers receiving a global effectiveness rating of ≥3. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-two clinicians received the simulation-based training, and 981 handovers were observed and rated. In the adult PACU, the estimated percentages of acceptable handovers (global ratings ≥3) among AP-RN pairs, where neither received simulation-based training (untrained dyads), was 3% (95% confidence interval, 1%-11%) at day 0, 10% (5%-19%) at training initiation (day 40), and 57% (33%-78%) at 1-year post-training initiation (day 405). For AP-RN pairs where at least one received the simulation-based training (trained dyads), these percentages were estimated to be 18% (11%-28%) and 68% (57%-76%) on days 40 and 405, respectively. The percentage of acceptable handovers was significantly greater on day 405 than it was on day 40 for both untrained (P < 0.001) and trained dyads (P < 0.001). Similar patterns were observed in the pediatric PACU. Three years later, the unadjusted estimate of the probability of an acceptable handover was 87% (72%-95%) in the adult PACU and 56% (40%-72%) in the pediatric PACU. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention substantially improved interprofessional PACU handovers, including those by clinicians who had not undergone formal simulation training. An effect appeared to be present >3 years later.

%X Despite the high rate of co-occurring medical conditions experienced by individuals receiving assertive community treatment (ACT), this comprehensive service model continues to be considered primarily a mental health intervention. Without compromising fidelity to the model, ACT can serve as an ideal platform from which to provide both primary and behavioral health care to those with complex service needs. Using a case example, this article considers the transformation of the ACT mental health care model into an integrated health care delivery system through establishing nursing and primary care partnerships. Specifically, by expanding and explicitly redefining the role of the ACT nurse, well-developed care models, such as Guided Care, can provide additional guidelines and training to ACT nurses who are uniquely trained and oriented to serve as the leader and coordinator of health integration efforts. © The Author(s) 2011.

%X Communications strategies are central to the planning and execution of interprofessional education (IPE) programs. The diversity of telecommunications-based tools and plat- forms available for IPE is rapidly expanding. Each tool and platform has a potentially important role to play. The selection, testing, and embedding of tools, such as social networking platforms, within education programs can be very challenging. The goal was to create, in Phoenix, a "command-and-control" video conferencing center (the "T-Health Amphitheater" or "Telehealth Amphitheater") in which tele-consultation patients, located physically at one of the affiliated tele-clinics around the state, could be presented electronically to interprofessional teams of faculty members from the University of Arizona Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Public Health, as well as those from the allied health colleges of other universities in Arizona, for interprofessional team training in a virtual classroom setting. The T-Health video conferencing facility was designed and built. Early assessments show that its novel learning environment is student- and facultyfriendly. T-Health Amphitheater's pair of innovative visible social networking platforms (eStacks™and eSwaps™) may help break down some of the traditional communications barriers encountered in healthcare IPE and medical practices.

%X The use of student Peer Assessment within the sphere of Higher Education is both innovative and intriguing. The accolades associated with this mechanism of assessment are clearly articulated as promoting a deep approach to learning and the development of astute self-appraisal skills. Within the context of both nurse education and professional nursing practice, these attributes are firmly endorsed as essential transferable skills. The platform for this discussion on Peer Assessment within Post-Registration Education is contextualised within the Community Nursing Specialist Practitioner Qualification, whose framework is predetermined by the Nursing and Midwifery Council [Nursing & Midwifery Council, 2001. Post Registration Standards for Specialist Education and Practice. NMC, London]. This degree level programme aims to prepare first level nurses to develop the knowledge, skills and attributes commensurate with Specialist Practice, defined as the capacity to exercise higher levels of judgement, discretion and decision making in clinical practice. Whilst engaging with Peer Assessment within this context was unquestionably challenging, the experience proved to be a viable approach to supporting and developing student learning. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Infection control (IC) efforts may encounter greater obstacles in developing countries. However, progress appears to have been made composed of designated and trained doctors, nurses, and others. E-learning is an important tool to bring health care professionals updated information, especially where teaching resources are limited. It allows the exchange of experiences between professionals, promotes simultaneous knowledge acquisition, and reaches some remote areas. Trained IC personnel are a scarce resource and their job is to prevent and control infection; their time and expertise must not be disproportionately utilized in counting infection only. Basic surveillance is an essential component of IC Programs and should be tailored for each institution. The data should be used to identify preventable infections so that resources are targeted in high priority areas requiring minimum resources. In addition, surveillance data can be used to compare infection rates between healthcare facilities, convince administrators, clinical teams and health care professionals to adopt recommended practices and help evaluate IC measures. For this last purpose one can easily find Guidelines issued by international health institutions or professional societies that indicate the basic requirements for an effective IC. The IC team should take into account to implement measures that are more cost-effective, and use all effort and creativity to adopt tools that could improve compliance. Positive Deviance method that is a social and behavioral change process based on the premise that in most organizations and communities there are people or groups of people who solve problems better than colleagues who have exactly the same resources. Another important concern in developing countries is integrating epidemiology and microbiology. Despite its relevance, knowledge about the status of antibiotic resistance in the developing world remains on the whole lacking. Regional special laboratories could provide a good amount of information about resistance and help in outbreak control.

%X Background: Clinicians are not good at identifying when a patient is approaching the end of their life. In order to identify clinicians who are good at this skill, we set out to develop a test of prognostic accuracy based on real-life cases. Aim: To observe the clinical course of patients thought to be in the last few days of life, in order to generate a series of cases with which to test the accuracy of clinicians' prognostic estimates. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of patients at a hospice or under the care of a hospital palliative care team. Recruitment took place between January and October 2015. Any inpatient, over 18 years old, who could speak English, and who was identified by the palliative care team as likely to die within the next two weeks, was eligible to participate. Demographic information, past medical history, Palliative Performance Score (PPS) which varies between 10% [moribund] to 100% [fully active], Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) which varies between -5 [unarousable] to +4 [combative], and symptoms during the admission were documented from observations, medical notes, and from discussion with the attending nurse or doctor. Results: 50 participants were recruited; 30/50 (60%) were men, the median age was 74.5 years (IQR 60, 85) and 36 (72%) were white British. The majority (33; 66%) had cancer. The median PPS score was 30% (IQR 10, 40), the median RASS score was -1 (IQR -4, 0). Of the 50 participants predicted to die within two weeks, 40 participants (87%) did so. 29 participants were predicted to die within 3 days, of whom 18 did so. The clinical course of each patient was summarised and used to create a “vignette”. Conclusions: Since the vignettes have been derived directly from clinical practice they will offer an authentic platform on which to test the prognostic accuracy of clinicians as well as the effectiveness of future training programs designed to improve the skill of prognostication.

In 1986, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion sought to create a framework that conveyed the notion of capacity building, related to specific settings, and a structured process for health promotion action. It provided the platform from which the health promoting hospital movement was later launched. Nearly two decades on, the health promoting hospital (HPH) movement has grown considerably and continues to expand, against the backdrop of having to adapt to the changing needs and demands of clients and the evolving social context of their communities. Many nurses, it is argued here, are often unaware of health promoting hospitals concepts or, when they are, do little to contribute to them. Method. A critical review of the available health promoting hospital and related literature has been conducted for discussion. Findings. The literature revealed that hospitals are being urged to reject practices based purely on health-limiting and limited biomedical frameworks, in favour of moving towards models based on health promoting hospitals and public health-orientated hospitals. This requires radical reform that focuses on the social and health policy context of organizations, the socio-political empowerment of its employers and clients, and the personal/collective positive health and welfare of its employers and clients. Many health service agencies are beginning to emphasize population health within communities as part of a concerted move away from an original primary focus on acute inpatient hospital-based service provision. Conclusion. Hospitals need to adapt and expand their efforts to focus on health promotion activities, in collaboration with the ever-widening community networks of health and social agencies. This requires the commitment of all health care professional groups. Nurses who practice in the hospital setting should be aiming to initiate and promote radical health promotion reform as set out in the health promoting hospital movement. This paper argues that nursing per se could be making much larger inroads and efforts to affect and implement wide-ranging health promotion activities in hospital organizations. Nurses should view the HPH movement as another opportunity truly to embrace evolving broad-based health promotion concepts, as a means to forge and own their own health agenda, and also as a means to move beyond the traditional reliance of a limited health education role. Relevance to clinical practice. Hospitals and their employees must be seen to advocate, support and implement wide-reaching social and community-based reform, as part of a necessary commitment to 'seamless' health care provision. The health promoting hospital movement represents a collective vehicle for enabling such activities. If nurses wish to be at the forefront of current health service strategies they must be seen to embrace the radical health promotion reforms that are emerging from the current literature and put forward in this article.

%X Using a standard communication tool can enhance and provide focus, to ensure that communication is accurately recorded and understood (Marquis and Huston, 2009). The Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation (SBAR) approach is common place in healthcare situations today (Institute for Health Improvement, 2011), thus justifying the use of this contemporary way of communicating to structure this article. Patient safety, clinical effectiveness and person centred approaches to care, are top priorities in healthcare today. As nursing is in transition to an all degree profession, these dimensions of care should be integral to any "top-up" qualification. This paper discusses how this current clinical agenda was embedded into a top-up degree along with improvement methodology, in order to prepare newly graduated nurses for the world of modern healthcare. The module was developed and delivered in collaboration with clinical practice to maintain credibility and realism for the students. Based on Salmon's model of e-learning (Salmon, 2004), the completely online delivery meant that the students learning occurred whilst clinically based, allowing for theory and practice to interweave in a meaningful way, resulting in actual quality improvement.

%X Introduction: Older patients face increased vulnerability to medications, particularly those active in the central nervous system. The Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI) is a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) nationwide psychopharmacology quality improvement (QI) program. The goal of PDSI is to ensure Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system have access to safe, effective, and evidence-based psychopharmacological treatment. The PDSI program supports Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and facility psychopharmacology QI initiatives by providing quarterly data on national, VISN, and facility-level performance on prescribing measures; facilitating clinical review of Veterans who may benefit from improvement in their psychotropic medication regimen via actionable patient lists updated nightly on the PDSI Clinical Management Dashboard; providing feedback and technical assistance for QI action planning; coordinating a national QI learning collaborative; and providing training and educational resources. On October 1, 2015, the PDSI launched Phase 2, which focuses on improving psychopharmacological care of older Veterans. Methods: The PDSI program is coordinated through the Office of Mental Health Operations (OMHO) in collaboration with Mental Health Services (MHS), Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM), and now in Phase 2 additionally with Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC). Phase 2 aims were determined through multiple stakeholder engagement with leadership and representatives from national, VISN, and facility mental health and geriatric provider groups. A subject matter expert workgroup developed prescribing measures to facilitate monitoring of facility, VISN, and national progress towards achieving these program aims. VISNs and facilities were instructed to identify priority measures on which to focus their local QI efforts in the coming year and to develop and submit local QI action plans for those measures. Ongoing monitoring and support for Phase 1 psychopharmacology QI initiatives continued at both the national and local level. Bimonthly national QI collaborative conference calls continued and a webinar series was developed to educate providers about the evidence-base that supports the program aims and prescribing measures. Results: PDSI Phase 2 aims include: 1) improve psychopharmacological care of patients with dementia, 2) decrease benzodiazepine and sedative hypnotic use among patients aged≥75 years, 3) increase metabolic monitoring among patients aged ≥ 75 years prescribed an antipsychotic, and 4) decrease use of highly anticholinergic medications among patients aged ≥ 75 years. Fourteen prescribing measures were developed that address these aims, 7 measures for outpatient prescribing and 7 matched measures for prescribing in Community Living Centers (CLCs, the VA equivalent of nursing homes). Baseline data (FY15Q3) for facility, VISN, and national scores on each measure were released to help facilities determine their priority measures, with quarterly updates to follow. Actionable patient lists identifying Veterans flagged on these 14 measures were added to the PDSI Clinical Management Dashboard, which is updated nightly. The number of facilities selecting specific measures will be determined in November 2015 and initial Phase 2 QI action plans will be submitted in December 2015. Local implementation of those action plans will follow. Over 250 people participated in each of the 5 online live webinar sessions and the recorded sessions will be available for further online training. Conclusions: PDSI Phase 2 builds upon an existing national and local QI program infrastructure to help educate providers about evidence-based geriatric psychopharmacology and to facilitate improvement in safe, effective use of psychotropic medications in the older Veteran population.

%X Nurses report some of the highest levels of stress of any professional group. The percentage of nurses with burnout has been reported to be between 40 and 49%. Prolonged stress may lead to burnout, manifesting in both physiological and psychological symptoms. Symptoms such as insomnia, headache and depression are common occurrences. In a recent review, nurses, including those involving interactions with physicians and patients, as well as workload concerns, reported nine common themes of stressors. The NHS has recognized the need to address stressors in healthcare workers and is working to improve communication and counseling services, as well as preventative stress management services. Multiple studies have shown that psychological resilience can prevent or attenuate burnout. For the past two decades, The Virtual Reality Medical Center (VRMC) has used VR-enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy to treat patients with stress, anxiety, trauma and chronic pain. We have also been able to provide civilian and military first responders with a continuum of care; with VR-enhanced training (stress inoculation training) provided prior to missions and VRenhanced treatment available both during and after missions. We have now begun to apply this continuum of training and treatment to the ever-increasing crisis of high stress and burnout in both physicians and nurses. Preliminary results from our on-going VR burnout prevention and treatment studies will be presented.

%X Background: In large healthcare institutions and in the wider community setting, effective education of all staff who care for patients towards the end of their lives can be difficult to achieve. The End of life care of all (e-ELCA) is a free e-learning package designed to increase learners' knowledge about end of life care that blends and complements existing educational programmes. It is aimed at all health and social care staff who have contact with those requiring end of life care in order for them to have the necessary skills to care for such patients. Aims: The aim of this project was to evaluate whether e-ELCA could provide time- and cost-effective end-of-life education in a difficult economic climate, engage staff in a novel way of continuing professional development, and make workforce development in end-of-life care 'real'. Method: The project team recruited 26 members of staff (nurses, allied health professionals and healthcare support workers), to take part in the pilot. Each participant chose one module from the programme to progress as far as they could over an 8-week period. A pre-pilot workshop was held to enable participants to 'have a go' within a supportive environment. Participants received support from their managers and were also able to apply for remote computer access enabling them to study at home using e-ELCA if they wished. Results: 94% of participants stated they would recommend e-ELCA to others and 47% stated they would definitely continue further study. Participants completed the module in a variety of ways, alone, in combination with a partner or as part of a group. Only 25% were allocated study time to complete the module. Conclusion: e-ELCA appears to be an effective ay to engage with staff in providing training in end-of-life care, however a majority of participants identified lack of time as a significant difficulty and limitation of the e-ELCA.

%X Background: More than 60% of multiple myeloma (MM) diagnoses and nearly 75% of deaths occur in patients over 65 years old. Because older adults (OAs) experience more treatment-related toxicities, treatment disruptions or dose reductions may be based on age and performance status alone, despite their poor predictive value for patient outcomes. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), including frailty indices, has shown predictive validity for toxicity and survival in OAs with MM, but is not routinely used in practice due to time and complexity, a lack of clarity about optimal tools and technologies to implement them, and clinician knowledge gaps on how to incorporate CGA into decision-making and care. Purpose: This project aims to address these gaps by pilot testing a tablet-based modified (m)CGA in 120 patients that presents compiled CGA results, including a frailty score, back to clinicians interacting with patients at the time of a treatment decision. Outcomes include feasibility, usability, utility, and impact on treatment decision-making, from both patient and provider perspectives. Pre-study implementation processes and milestones, including development of the mCGA, clinical workflow planning processes, training and other site-initiation activities are presented herein. Methods: The mCGA was developed using an iterative and dynamic consensus-driven process that included: 1) literature review and expert input to identify CGA domains for potential inclusion and 2) consensus building within a multi-disciplinary panel of gero-oncology experts, nurse scientists, and psychometricians. Domains and measures were selected based on predictive ability, length, and ability to administer via patient self-report so as to reduce clinician assessment burden. Study training and implementation procedures were developed using the same approach, as well as through workflow analysis and clinical team consensus building at the participating sites. Results: The Palumbo frailty index (FI) was chosen as the core of the mCGA tool given correlation with clinical outcomes specifically in OAs with MM. In addition to the 4 mGA measures comprising the Palumbo FI (age, comorbidity, ADL, and IADL), other GA variables were also chosen based on their strong predictive ability, clinical feasibility, and relevance to the MM population. This summary of results is displayed for ease of provider use within the Carevive dashboard (see Figure 1). Given prevalent knowledge gaps in use of CGA for MM treatment decision-making and care, a certified medical education self-study course was developed for training prior to the study intervention. Four geographically-dispersed academic and community hospitals who treat high volumes of diverse MM patients are participating to date. All 4 sites developed a process for ensuring treating providers would have easy access to the platform. Conclusions: Real-world, comprehensive and innovative solutions, combining education, geriatric assessment (GA) tools to determine a patient's fit/frailty status, realistic clinical work flow processes, and technology tools are needed to support and enhance treatment-decision making for patients with MM as well as their providers.

%X Work in Progress. Background: Virtual patients (VPs) are computer-based patient encounters that allow learners to engage in simulated scenarios making clinical decisions for an on-screen patient. VPs afford learners repetitious opportunities to practice as healthcare professionals in ''low-stake'' environments, while simultaneously providing objective feedback and/or patient outcomes based on their decisions. 1 VPs have been utilized by educators in pharmacy, nursing, and medicine disciplines with effectiveness.2,3 Research on the design and integration of VPs in psychiatric education and training remains limited. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VPs for training psychiatry residents in an interdisciplinary educational setting. Methods: Third year psychiatry residents were allocated twenty minutes at the beginning of four pharmacist-led, psychopharmacology education sessions to complete a VP case. Three learning objectives were developed for each VP case and training session. Pre- and post-test questions were administered prior to and after each VP case. These assessment questions were reviewed by psychiatrists and psychiatric pharmacists prior to implementation, and were designed to assess resident comprehension and application of focused psychopharmacology topics. Residents received feedback from the pharmacist and physician rotation director during a debriefing period following completion of each VP case. Outcomes: Scores from pre- and post-test assessments will be analyzed to determine residents' understanding and application of advanced psychopharmacology. Additionally, resident attendance to the educational series and average time to case completion will be evaluated. Faculty will be surveyed to further elicit the utility of this teaching strategy moving forward. Data collection is ongoing and will be completed May 15, 2015; evaluation of preliminary outcomes will be presented.

%X Purpose/Objective: Nowadays, electronic charting is widely used in healthcare. The electronic patient file has been introduced on our ward since May 2011 to improve workflow and quality of documentation. Two years after implementation, the benefits and limitations of electronic nursing records are identified. This will contribute to the accurate selection of a future electronic system in our hospital. Materials and Methods: Benefits and limitations are gained by individual interviews with all nurses on the pediatric hemato-oncology ward. Simultaneously, a retrospective analysis of 20 electronic nursing records during a two-week period is performed. Results: The obtained patient information is correct, actual, traceable and linked to electronic medical records, imaging, online databases and lab results. It improves standardization and uniformity within the hospital. Although trends and graphics of some important vital signs are available, more extended data extraction is devious and an adequate search function is lacking. Different health-care providers in the hospital have access to all relevant patient information without re-questioning the patient, which simplifies communication and consultation and facilitates decision making. Retrospective analysis of nursing records revealed a lack of structure and difficulties to get a quick general view of the patient's condition and needs. The use of electronic nursing records results in a fragmentariness of care items which results in incomplete nursing records and is timeconsuming. This is mainly due to gaps in the electronic system: input of essential data is not exceeded over time and has to be completed upon each admission. Conclusions: The results of this survey indicate that the workflow can be improved on our ward. Progress in this area is strongly recommended in our future electronic nursing platform as this is an important daily used tool for accurate patient care.

%X BACKGROUND: The global use of mobile devices with their connectivity capacity, and integrated with the affordances of social media networks, provides a resource-rich platform for innovative student-directed learning experiences. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the experiences of undergraduate nurses on the improvement of primary health care education at a School of Nursing at a University in the Western Cape, South Africa, through the incorporation of a social media application, WhatsApp. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, and contextual design was used to explore and describe data collected from a purposive sample of 21 undergraduate nursing students. The study population was engaged in a WhatsApp discussion group to enhance their integration of theory and clinical practice of the health assessment competency of the Primary Health Care Module. Participants submitted electronic reflections on their experiences in the WhatsApp discussion group via email on completion of the study. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data collected was done according to Tesch's (1990) steps of descriptive data analysis in order to identify the major themes in the study. The electronic reflections were analysed to explore their rich, reflective data. RESULTS: Seven themes were identified that included: positive experiences using the WhatsApp group; the usefulness of WhatsApp for integrating theory and clinical practice; the availability of resources for test preparation; opportunity for clarification; anonymity; exclusion of students as a result of the lack of an appropriate device, and the application caused the battery of the device to run flat quickly. CONCLUSION: The results of the experiences of students in the WhatsApp discussion group could be used to inform the use of social media applications in teaching and learning, with the purpose of enhancing the integration of the theory and clinical practice.

%X Currently in the UK children and young people with diabetes receive variable provision of care and support in educational settings. There are concerns that this impacts on the young person's glycaemic control, their quality of life, and their educational performance and outcome. Whilst most paediatric diabetes teams provide training for school staff, it may take several days, even weeks, after diagnosis before a diabetes educator is able to attend the school to provide education and support. The aims of this project were to develop a comprehensive, consensus-based, e-learning package that would inform education providers about diabetes and provide a framework for the best practice management and support of young people with type 1 diabetes in schools. This package was not intended to replace the visit from the specialist nurse but to complement this and allow the young person to return to education at the earliest possible opportunity. This was achieved by convening a series of multi-agency stakeholder workshops including clinicians, patients / families, teachers, and voluntary sector representatives, to discuss the content and format that this package should take. These discussions were then developed into two e-learning modules (basic and advanced) by a core team of diabetes educators from 3 regional diabetes networks. The modules provide guidance to all key parties involved in the day to day support of young people with diabetes, including expected roles and responsibilities, and legal obligations. The basic module is aimed at all staff to raise their general awareness of type 1 diabetes. The advanced module is for those staff designated specific responsibilities for supporting the young person with type 1 and goes into greater depth regarding the management and treatment of diabetes in the school setting. These modules have been positively received by education providers, and are endorsed by the National Children and Young Person's Diabetes Network.

%X The West Midlands contains three major trauma centres; Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire and University Hospital North Staffordshire, along with Birmingham Children's Hospital who provide the paediatric trauma service. In April 2013 practitioners with newly developed roles in trauma in the Emergency Department made initial contact, and in October 2013 a formal collaborative was formed, with membership consisting of anaesthetic practitioners, both nurses and Operating Department Practitioners that are working in the ED setting as an integral part of the trauma team. Our poster presentation will serve to introduce the work of the collaborative to the wider clinical community. Working alongside the ED staff the practitioners engage in the clinical care of acute admissions, including but not limited to trauma, medical, burns and paediatric alerts. A summary of the roles and responsibilities, extended skills, training and development and impact will be included in order to demonstrate the relevance and contributions made by those in the role. The poster presentation will be an excellent platform to promote the collaborative and its work and inspire colleagues from similar institutions in the UK. The future aspiration for the collective is to establish shared educational and learning opportunities, a cross site skills exchange programme and facilitate a forum for sharing experiences and improving practice, with the potential to expand and include more centres across the wider region or country. The scope for creating an accredited qualification via a university based training programme is also being explored, to allow Practitioners to be formally recognised for their extended skills. The opportunity to present at the annual Trauma Care Conference will allow the collaborative to clearly demonstrate the scope of the speciality and introduce the key roles that are undertaken and how they can improve patient care, as well as setting out future aspirations to the visiting clinical cohort.

%X Purpose: To describe the use of human patient simulation (HPS) scenarios in interprofessional education involving students from different healthcare disciplines representing three regional colleges. Methods: Since May 2009, faculty from the Washington State University (WSU) Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing and University of Washington (UW) physician assistant (PA) program have collaborated to conduct interprofessional HPS scenarios in the following content areas: Adult Shortness of Breath, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) and Pediatric Respiratory Distress. Doctor of Pharmacy (WSU), Nursing (WSU and Spokane Community College) and PA (UW) students were included in all three scenarios with the addition of first year medical students (UW) during the ACLS scenario. Each scenario lasted approximately 20 minutes and was immediately followed with a 30-minute debriefing session facilitated by faculty from all disciplines. The four global learning objectives for each simulation included the following: • Demonstrate appropriate discipline specific skills. • Diagnose and implement appropriate initial treatment plan. • Demonstrate professional communication skills in a healthcare team. • Communicate effectively when giving a patient case report for nursing change of shift and/or a clinical case presentation to a consultant or preceptor. Results: Throughout the three scenarios, a total of 23 students from the various programs participated. During the debriefing session, students were able to reflect on their individual roles as well as the interactions of the team. For each scenario a common theme has emerged centering on lack of familiarity with each other's roles. Conclusions: These simulation scenarios are unique because multiple healthcare disciplines and different academic institutions all worked together. Challenges included the coordination of academic and class schedules across programs and matching appropriate skill levels amongst the students. Continued efforts are underway to expand interprofessional opportunities to allow wider student participation and to develop scenarios in other areas of practice.

%X OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to pilot a "hybrid" style journal club and determine whether measurable effects could be detected over 8-weeks' time on evidence-based practice ability, desire, behaviors, use, and barriers. BACKGROUND: Journal clubs have been suggested as a method to increase nurses' confidence with using research evidence to guide practice. However, it is yet unknown how nurse educators can best implement effective programs for clinicians with varying schedules, education levels, and research skills. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six participants from one large urban United States hospital (72% registered nurses) were invited to access bi-weekly interdisciplinary journal club activities. Nurse educators created curriculum focused on clinical problem solving that was offered via in-person sessions or a social media site. METHODS: A pretest-posttest no control group design was used to measure impacts of those engaged in journal club activities. Data were collected using a combination of validated evidence-based practice instruments and program participation records. FINDINGS: A two-tailed paired t test showed significant increases over 8weeks' time in evidence-based practice use (p=.002) and behaviors (p=.007). Slight preference for in-person sessions was reported, although greater participation was reflected in online activities. Mean satisfaction ratings were high; however, attrition rates suggest that more is needed to maximize clinician engagement. CONCLUSION: A hybrid method using online and in-person sessions was feasible and adaptive for varying learning styles and work schedules. Positive changes in measurements were detected among journal club participants. Instruments were identified that may be useful for trialing similar programs intended to increase evidence-based practice self-efficacy, use, behaviors, and ability.

%X As human patient simulation becomes more prevalent in acute care settings, clinical experts are often asked to assist in developing scenarios. Although the Jeffries/National League for Nursing Simulation Framework has been used in academic settings to guide the instructional design of clinical simulations, its use in acute care settings is less known. This framework incorporates a consideration of contextual elements, design characteristics, and outcomes. An external validation study applying the framework within the context of acute care showed its overall strength as well as elements that were problematic. The implications derived from the study of the design characteristics in a hospital setting can be used by nurses who are considering either adopting or adapting this framework for their own practice.

%X AIM The purpose of this study was to determine whether a difference exists in learner performance and the type and frequency of diagnostic reasoning skills used, based on the method of case presentation. BACKGROUND Faculty can select from a variety of methods for presenting cases when teaching diagnostic reasoning, but little evidence exists with regard to how students use these skills while interacting with the cases. METHOD A total of 54 nursing students participated in two case analyses using human patient and computer-based simulations. Participant performance and diagnostic reasoning skills were analyzed. RESULTS Performance was significantly better with the human patient simulation case. All diagnostic reasoning skills were used during both methods of case presentation, with greater performance variation in the computer-based simulation. CONCLUSION Both human patient and computer-based simulations are beneficial for practicing diagnostic reasoning skills; however, these findings support the use of human patient simulations for improving student performance in case synthesis.

%X Within the multidisciplinary team required to manage people with multiple sclerosis (MS) effectively, the nurse is the central component of coordinated care and support. A 2009 survey led by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform, an umbrella organization of national MS associations, identified variance and disparity across Europe in the nursing care of MS patients. This led to development of MS Nurse PROfessional, a continuing medical education-accredited modular online learning program endorsed and approved by leading international nursing and professional groups, and people with MS, as a tool to support the evolving role of the European MS nurse. Analysis of participant experience and nurse practice to date has been overwhelmingly positive. Expansion of MS Nurse PRO is underway or planned for future.

%X Purpose: Nurses are on the front line in encounters with elder neglect. In spite of their significant role, they are not always aware of this. The purpose of this paper was to understand the meanings that nurses ascribe to elder neglect through their perceptions and professional experience with older people and to throw light on nurses' significant role in this encounter. Design and Methods: An integrated review of the current literature was completed and 30 Israeli professional nurses working in long-term geriatric care facilities were interviewed using a semistructured interview guide. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed according to the phenomenological method. Findings and Conclusions: Four major themes emerged: (a) neglect from the outside or neglect from within; (b) between professional and personal; (c) whose responsibility is this? and (d) professional values and ethics in the face of a neglecting reality. Findings are discussed in relation to the nurses' experiences of the encounter with elder neglect and the consequences of the phenomenon, such as increasing ageist perceptions and behavior. Clinical Relevance: As the world experiences higher life expectancy, nursing education should be challenged with elder mistreatment in general, and elder neglect in particular. Training and educational programs should provide a platform on which to raise dilemmas concerning the encounter with this subject. © 2012 Sigma Theta Tau International.

%X Background: Curricular changes to palliative care communication training are needed in order to accommodate a variety of learners, especially in lieu of the projected national shortage of hospice and palliative medicine physicians and nurses. Objective: This study assessed the utility of a palliative care communication curriculum offered through an online platform and also examined health care professionals' clinical communication experiences related to palliative care topics. Design: Four of the seven modules of the COMFORT communication curriculum were made available online, and participant assessments and knowledge skills were measured. Setting: Modules were completed and assessed by 177 participants, including 105 nurses, 25 physicians, and a category of 'other' disciplines totaling 47. Measurements: Premodule surveys consisted of closed-ended items developed by the interdisciplinary research team. Postcurriculum evaluation and knowledge quizzes were used to assess program effectiveness. Results: Among all participants, end-of-life care and recurrence of disease were considered the most challenging communication contexts and discussion about treatment options the least challenging. Mean responses to postcurriculum evaluation for all modules across nurse and physician participants was greater than 4 on a scale of 1 to 5. Conclusions: This study identifies the COMFORT communication curriculum as an effective online curricular tool to teach multiple disciplines specific palliative care communication. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert Inc.

%X Background: Knowledge on malignant hyperthermia (MH) has expanded vastly during the past decades, but not everyone is up to date on all this newfound knowledge. To assess the current level of knowledge on MH, a survey was performed among Dutch anaesthesia personnel. Research questions were: What is the current general knowledge of anaesthesia personnel about MH; furthermore, do anaesthesiologists (in training) know more than (trainee) nurse anaesthetists; and, does experience with a MH crisis and/or triggerfree anaesthesia result in a better overall knowledge score? Materials and methods: The survey consisted of an online questionnaire, responders were recruited via Dutch social media groups for anaesthesia personnel. The survey entailed 12 questions, 3 of which assessed the responders profession, hospital, and whether the participant had previously encountered MH in their practice (i.e. MH crisis and/or triggerfree anaesthesia). The other 9 questions assessed the existing knowledge on MH. The questions covered various important aspects of MH: knowledge on the incidence, triggers, symptoms, prevention, (importance of early) recognition, and treatment. The maximum possible score was 12 points. Crosstabs and one way anova analysis was performed with SPSS Statistical software package version 21 for statistical analysis, P <0,05 was taken to represent significance. Correctness of the answers was assessed in relation to the available literature and EMHG guidelines on the subject. Results: A total of 104 (n=104) responders entered the survey, of which 22 were anaesthesiologists; 20 residents; 42 nurse anaesthetists; 17 trainee nurse anaesthetists; 3 did not specify their profession. Among responders 52 subjects had no previous experience with MH in practice, as opposed to 51 who did have experience (1 subject did not specify), the latter group had a significantly higher knowledge score. Results of the knowledge questions and total knowledge scores are shown in table 1. Conclusions: Knowledge on MH is not quite as rare as the disease but certainly needs improvement as evidenced by this survey. Anaesthesiologists and residents have significantly better knowledge than (trainee) nurse anaesthetists. Yet the highest average knowledge score of 4.68 out of a maximum of 12 points is disappointing reflecting insufficient basic knowledge on MH. These observations call for improved knowledge dissemination of this rare but very dangerous complication of anaesthesia. Means by which this might be achieved is simulation education as (Table Presented) anaesthesia personnel with experience have a significantly better knowledge score.

%X Background & Hypothesis: Registered nurses care for many complex patients in a general hospital including those developing alcohol withdrawals (AW). Delirium tremens, a severe form of AW, if untreated, can lead to mortality. Often, knowledge and assessment skill gaps exist in assessment of alcohol-related problems. Methods: The Department of Psychological Medicine created an e-Learning module to target identified knowledge gaps that encompass theoretical knowledge of alcohol withdrawal (pathophysiology, identification, investigations, management and monitoring of patients), and showcased the skills component by using Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment-Alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar) in the videos with each progression of AW demonstrated. Pre- and post-test scores were obtained in the form of 10 multiple choice questions (MCQ) and assessing severity of AW based on a series of videos using CIWA-Ar charting. Results: A total of 91 registered nurses completed both the pre- and post-test MCQs. There was an improvement of 56% (n = 51) in the pre- and post-MCQs scores. Sixty-five registered nurses completed the pre- and post-test assessments for assessing severity of AW using CIWA-Ar charting. A majority (n = 49, 75%) scored the severity of AW correctly during the pre-test assessment and 56 (86%) for the post-test assessment. Out of 16 nurses who failed the pre-test assessments, 87.5% (n = 14) showed improvement in the post-test. Discussion & Conclusion: The preliminary findings revealed the positive use of the use of e-Learning module which had been effective in bridging the knowledge gaps for registered nurses. This module is also effective in enhancing nurses' assessment skills.

%X BACKGROUND: The Virtual Interprofessional Patients-Computer-Assisted Reproductive Health Education for Students (VIP-CARES) Project took place during the summers of 2010-2012 for eight weeks each year at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Undergraduate health care students worked collaboratively to develop virtual patient case-based learning modules on the topic of family planning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in perception towards interprofessional collaboration (IPC) among the participants, before and after the project. METHODS: This study utilized a mixed methods evaluation using self-assessment survey instruments, semi-structured interviews, and reflective essays. Pre- and post- project surveys were adapted from the Canadian Medical Education Determinants (CanMEDS) and Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative (CIHC) frameworks, as well as the Memorial University Interprofessional Attitudes (IPA) questionnaire. The survey results were analyzed as mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) on Likert scales. The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if any significant changes were measured between each participant's differences in score (p ≤ 0.05). Post-project interview transcripts and essays were analyzed using recursive abstraction to elicit any themes. RESULTS: Altogether, 26 students in medicine, pharmacy, nursing, midwifery, dentistry, counselling psychology, and computer science participated in VIP-CARES, during the three years. Student attitudes toward IPC were positive before and after the project. At the project's conclusion, there was a statistically significant increase in the participants' self-assessment competency scores in the CanMEDS roles of health advocate (p = 0.05), manager (p = 0.02), and medical expert (p = 0.03), as well as the CIHC domains of interprofessional communication (p = 0.04), role clarification (p = 0.01), team functioning (p = 0.05), and collaborative leadership (p = 0.01). Qualitative evaluations yielded three major themes: communication and respect as key to team functioning, importance of role clarification within the team, and existence of inherent challenges to IPC. From the reflections, students generally felt more comfortable with their improvements in the CIHC domains of interprofessional communication, team functioning, and role clarification. CONCLUSION: After working within an interdisciplinary team developing virtual patient learning modules on family planning, the student participants of the VIP-CARES Project indicated general improvement in the skills necessary for effective interprofessional collaboration. Triangulation of the overall data suggests this was especially observed within the areas of interprofessional communication, team functioning, and role clarification.

%X Background & Hypothesis: A quality improvement project was undertaken by staff from IMH Pharmacy to determine the baseline level of prescription errors (PEs) and their root causes in outpatient Clinic B. The multidisciplinary team of pharmacists, doctors, nurses and pharmacy technicians seek to identify potential areas of improvements to reduce PEs by 70% within 6 months. Methods: Possible root causes of PEs were identified and significant ones ranked using an Ishikawa diagram and Pareto principle respectively. The following interventions were implemented after some small scale testing using the Plan-Do-Study-Act approach: 1) a handy iPharm guide with step-by-step screenshots of each type of order entry was printed for doctors in every consult-room; 2) on demand one-on-one hands-on physician training on specific areas in iPharm by pharmacist; and 3) a testing platform for physicians to practise at their convenience; and 4) software enhancement to highlight active medication screen. Results: PEs per 1000 prescriptions were measured weekly. After 3 interventions, the team achieved 34% reduction of mean PEs from pre-intervention period of 11.7 per 1000 prescriptions to postintervention period of 7.7 per 1000 prescriptions. Discussion & Conclusion: Unfamiliarity with prescribing software likely contributed to an increase in PEs during the 6-monthly changeover of Medical Officers. Similarly, error rate increased when some prescribers were unaware of changes made to iPharm ordering instructions for liquid medications. Prescribing and dispensing the correct medication were the primary targets of this project. Interdisciplinary collaboration to reduce PEs and rework for correcting errors saved cost to the organisation and improved staff satisfaction. This established a culture of safety within the institution.

%X Introduction: Current sedation practice using intravenous agents have been shown to prolong mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of delirium within intensive care unit (ICU) patients.1 There is good evidence demonstrating that volatile anesthetic agents reduce extubation times and provide a superior quality of sedation compared to standard agents.2,3 However, volatilebased sedation within the critical care environment is a novel technique and necessitates development of effective inter-professional education tools to facilitate safety and feasibility. Objective: The Use of Volatile Anesthetics for Long-Term Sedation (VALTS) study is a pilot prospective RCT assessing the safety and feasibility of delivering inhaled isoflurane using the Anesthesia Conserving Device (AnaConDa®, Sedana Medical, Sweden) compared to standard intravenous midazolam/propofol for long-term ICU sedation. The objectives of this project were:- 1) Development of inter-professional education tools 2) Conduct pre-study initiation surveys to assess opinions and experience of volatile-based sedation among respiratory therapist (RT) and nursing (RN) staff. Methods: Pre-study questionnaire designed to examine knowledge, experience and safety of using volatile agents was delivered to 123 RT and RN staff during 30 in-service training sessions within one medical surgical (MSICU) and one cardiovascular (CVICU) intensive care unit. Two manuals were developed to facilitate inter-professional education on volatile agents. Results: The questionnaire shows that the majority of staff have 5 years of ICU experience (74.8%) but have limited exposure with the administration of volatile anesthetics (85.4%). Most staff are interested in volatile-based sedation (79.8%) but only a small proportion had no concerns about its administration (22.3%) and safety for staff (12.5%). There are no significant differences in ratings of current sedation practice between the MSICU RNs, CVICU RNs, and RTs. Conclusion: This project confirms a high interest in administering volatile anesthetics for ICU sedation. However, on-going inter-professional education is required to enhance knowledge and principles of safety, which is being provided by formal lectures, a practical bedside manual and an indepth teaching manual that will be available in paper format and free e-learning module. Future work includes assessment of these teaching aids by on-going staff feedback, post-study opinion survey, and monitoring the safety and feasibility of our pilot study. (Table Presented).

%X Background: REDCap (Research Enterprise Data CAPture) software may provide a feasible platform for CMR Centers to: a) capture clinical throughput securely for research purposes, and 2) collaborate using a common platform for either distributed or centralized data storage. REDCap may facilitate CMR Centers' participation in the research enterprise, especially those with limited resources. REDCap may catalyze multicenter studies with “distributed data collection” where CMR sites can clone shared data dictionaries across sites for subsequent compilation into a singular master data file. Methods: Investigators without prior REDCap training created a REDCap database hosted by the University of Pittsburgh with software developed by Vanderbilt University. In an IRB approved protocol. A full time research nurse consented patients referred for clinical CMR scans and abstracted patients' clinical data into REDCap during CMR scanning. Data elements included: key summary findings from CMR (volumes, LGE, etc) and all prior cardiac imaging data including full (unstructured) reports pasted into text fields or uploaded pdf attachments; blood testing acquired during IV placement; demographics; comorbidity; and medications. Front end quality assurance measures included data formats, data ranges, and redundant identifiers. We maximized data security by configuring users' rights, limiting data exports to the only the principal investigator, and logging every time stamped manipulation to the database. Adverse event queries occurred biannually. Data were entered via a web browser and stored on encrypted servers behind firewalls. Data were exported to statistical software packages for analysis. Results: We established single center feasibility. We enrolled >3000 consecutive individuals over 3.5 years. This cohort formed the basis for several publications and ongoing investigations. No security breaches occurred. To demonstrate feasibility of multicenter data collection, we imported two entire REDCap project databases (field names and structure without data) from the University of Minnesota and the University College of London via email exchange of a .csv file. We cloned the databases rendering them operational in <5 minutes similar to a new collaborative project site. We also queried the world map of REDCap capable sites (http://www.project-redcap.org) to demonstrate the potential for global multicenter data collection (Figure 1). Conclusions: REDCap is widely available and provides a robust platform for clinical CMR research. REDCap provides sites with limited resources a powerful means for rich data collection for clinical CMR research. Scarce resources can then be directed to the burden of rich data collection necessary for robust risk adjustment and multiple hypothesis testing. Shared REDCap data dictionaries are feasible and have the potential to enhance collaboration. REDCap has the potential to accelerate clinical CMR research.

%X Background and Goal of Study: High Fidelity medical simulation has been used as an effective educational tool for training residents. The aim of using simultaion is to improve the quality of healthcare through teaching teamwork and clinical decision making. Simulation provides an enhanced environment for experiential learning and reflective practice. Patient safety outcomes may be enhanced if resident training in acute areas eg. operating theatres (OT) and intensive care unit (ICU) is first developed using simultaion training. Materials and methods: All residents posted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital Anaesthesiology Department completed a questionaire assessing their baseline knowledge of critical care medicine. Results of the questionaire were kept confidential and residents were given an opportunity to seek clarification on areas of doubt. Residents were divided into groups of 2 residents, partnered with groups of 4 nurses trained in critical care areas. All groups underwent high-fidelity simultaion training on 3 real-life based case scenarios, namely: 1. Resuscitation of the patient witg massive haemorrahge 2. Resuscitation of a patient in septic shock 3. Management of a malignant cardiac arrhthmia During the simultaion training, 2 independent assessors rated the residents performance on task-specific technical skills, medications used and behaviour displayed, using direct observed procedural skills (DOPS) assessment. After completion of the simultaion, all residents completed an evaluation questionaire which included learner satisfaction scores. Results and discussion: All residents indicated that simultaion training was useful in teaching management of critically ill patients. Most residents indicated that they were more confident in the management of the critically ill patients seen in an emergency setting. They also indicated a better understanding of team work and the importance of communication with the rest of the team, including nurses. Conclusion(s): High-fidelity simultaion training is an effective and useful educational technique for training anaesthetic residents in common but critical clinical scenarios. We should strive to make simulation of crises scenarios an important and necessary module in training future anaesthetic residents. This would allow team work and assessment of competency of these residents in a controlled and safe environment.

%X The use of virtual worlds has exploded in popularity, but getting started may not be easy. In this article, the authors, members of the corporate nursing education team at University Health Network, outline their experience with incorporating virtual technology into their learning environment. Over a period of several months, a virtual hospital, including two nursing units, was created in Second Life®, allowing more than 500 nurses to role-play in a safe environment without the fear of making a mistake. This experience has provided valuable insight into the best ways to develop and learn in a virtual environment. The authors discuss the challenges of installing and building the Second Life® platform and provide guidelines for preparing users and suggestions for crafting educational activities.

%X Context National statistics predict that a significant proportion of our Paediatric Outpatient Clinic patients will be overweight (BMI, body mass index, 91st-98th centile) or obese (BMI >98th centile). Height and weight is already routinely obtained from each clinic patient, and plotted on a growth chart by clinic nursing staff. Problem Families might reasonably assume, and national guidelines would recommend, that any problem highlighted by this data would be recognised and discussed by the clinician. We suspected that only a minority of clinicians were recognising, raising and documenting the issue of increased BMI in the clinic. Assessment of problem and analysis of its causes Height, weight, sex and identifying number for all clinic attendees (aged 2-18 years, n = 238) were recorded over 3 weeks in November 2014. Clinic staff and clinicians were blind to the audit's purpose. 25 patients (10.5%) were overweight (BMI 91st-98th centile) and 33 (13.9%) were obese (>98th centile). Only 20.4% (11/54) of available corresponding clinic letters acknowledged the raised BMI; all of these were in the obese category, with none of the overweight children being acknowledged as such. Only 13.0% (7/54) documented any discussion or action taken (e.g. dietetic referral). Results were presented to the department (see below). Perceived barriers to raising the issue included: 1) difficulty recognising increased BMI from only raw height/weight; 2) clinicians' anxiety around family reaction. Intervention . Plot BMI and document alongside height/weight in medical notes, to bring to clinician's attention. . Education/awareness raising amongst consulting clinicians. Strategy for change Clinic nursing staff were trained to use the BMI look-up tool on the RCPCH 2012 Growth Charts (Figure 1). This involves reading off height and weight centiles, plotting one extra point on the back of the chart, then reading off a BMI centile. A new rubber template stamp was procured, providing a space to enter BMI (alongside other core parameters including height/weight) in the medical notes (Figure 2). BMI charts and relevant leaflets (healthy eating, local lifestyle programme) were made available in clinic rooms to facilitate consultations. An educational meeting slot (for medics, nurses and allied professionals) was given to discussion of: • Audit results • National guidance, importance of the issue • Planned interventions • Communication tips from e-learning module • Core healthy eating/activity advice • Referral pathways • Feedback A follow-up email was sent to all consulting clinicians containing the same points. Feedback from discussions held with the obesity service dietitians was positive. Throughout the process we agreed with staff feedback that raising the issue is not universally appropriate, depending on the nature of other discussions and existing relationships with families. Measurement of improvement After 6 weeks, a second audit cycle gathered measurements from 186 children (70 overweight/ obese, 37.6%). Of 64 eligible letters, 20 (31.3%) acknowledged increased BMI. Three were in the overweight category (previously none of these were acknowledged). 17 (26.6%) documented offer of advice or referral. Effects of changes We have demonstrated a significant improvement in addressing raised BMI in paediatric clinic patients. The proportion of clinic letters documenting advice or referral doubled after our intervention (26.6% vs 13.0%, P = 0.034). This is a positive step forward in-line with national guidance. Lessons learnt The extra point for BMI can be plotted very quickly. In several cases the plotting was complete but no BMI centile was written in the outpatient notes, despite the stamp being used there. Further cycles of regular education and training for clinicians and clinic staff, with feedback, will be necessary to consolidate these improvements. Message for others Our work shows that a simple additional plot on a growth chart, supported by educational sessions, resulted in more families being offered advice on an important bu sensitive health issue. Tackling the problem early on in the consultation process could potentially improve the presenting symptom as well as overall health. (Figure Presented).

%X Introduction: A multidisciplinary working party comprising health care professionals (from medical, nursing and therapy backgrounds) and educationalists trichomotised the 'competencies' in the Department of Health Stroke Specific Education Framework into learning outcomes most appropriate to embed within e-learning, simulation training and classroom-based teaching modalities. We summarise the design and development of the e-learning tool aimed as a resource to help trainees recognise and diagnose the symptoms and signs of stroke. Method: A taxonomy of stroke aetiologies, clinical presentations and management protocols was created and a curriculum-mapping exercise was completed in the design of a comprehensive stroke e-learning tool. A previous study highlighted the need for clinical fidelity and ethics approval was therefore obtained to capture clinical resources from patient episodes. Results: A multimedia e-learning tool was built around an array of acute neurological scenarios of stroke and stroke mimic presentations. The scenarios incorporated real-time information from 39 health care professionals and 20 patients with each clinical episode contributing an aspect of the tool (e.g. pre-hospital care, admission, neurological assessment, investigations includingmulti-modal imaging, and post-event discussions with clinicians). These resources were augmented with 3-dimensional anatomical graphics providing a rich data set. Each scenario followed a standardised teaching process. Conclusion: A multi-media e-learning tool may provide a vehicle for stroke training by bringing the mappings between theory and practice to life in the form of highly realistic scenarios. Further evaluation and validation are planned once the e-learning tool is deployed online.

%X BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Access to appropriate information and support remains problematic for many men diagnosed with prostate cancer, especially in rural and remote areas of Australia. We have developed an online clinical support program, PROSTMATE, which aims to overcome these barriers to access. PROSTMATE is a secure portal that provides a platform to access web-based consultations with nurses and psychologists, tailored information, a place to record treatments, test results and appointments, online tracking tools and self-directed support programs to improve health and well-being. METHODS: PROSTMATE (www.prostmate.org.au) is freely accessible to men affected by prostate cancer, their families and others interested in prostate cancer. PROSTMATE was launched in November 2013, and we have monitored its uptake, user engagement and participant feedback. The system collects patient-reported outcomes and provides clinical alerts to clinicians when problems are identified. RESULTS: Over 1100 people have registered. 72% of members are from metropolitan areas and 22.5% from regional or remote areas. The majority of members (56.5%) are men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Self-reported problems at registration indicated that 17.2% of men with prostate cancer reported at risk levels of mood problems and 41.4% reported at risk levels of sexual intimacy problems. 23.5% of partners reported at risk levels of relationship problems, and 41.2% reported at risk levels of sexual intimacy problems. Telehealth consultations have steadily grown and appear to be an acceptable delivery mode for men and their families. Barriers to implementation of this program will be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: PROSTMATE shows promise in supporting men and their families by offering access to specialist prostate cancer nurses and allied health services supported by online assessment tools and clinical alerts. This paper will explore how PROSTMATE could provide a novel way of improving care, overcoming access barriers including geography and stigma, and the potential benefits of the integration of these systems into routine care. Research Implications: The integration and use of this system has potential to collect a large amount of patient outcome and patterns of use data. We are currently evaluating the use of this program in clinical practice and hope that it offers a new and efficient model of care. Practice Implications: Delivery of clinical nursing and allied health care with the assistance of this web-based program provides benefits and challenges. Patients have improved access to services despite geographic location, and remote monitoring of patient-reported outcomes online have the potential to enhance followup care and referrals to appropriate services. However, integration of this system into current models of care poses challenges for clinicians, and this will be discussed.

%X Background and Aims:E-learning is developing fast because of the rapid increased use of smartphones, tablets and portable computers. We might not think of it as e-learning, but today many new e-books are in fact very complex electronic teaching platforms. It is generally accepted that e-learning is as effective as classroom teaching methods, but little is known about its value in relaying contents of different levels of complexity to students. We set out to investigate e-learning effects on simple recall and complex problem-solving compared to classroom teaching.Methods:63 nurses specializing in anesthesiology were evenly randomized into three groups. They were given internet-based knowledge tests before and after attending a teaching module about respiratory physiology and pulmonology. The three groups was either an e-learning group with eBook teaching material, an e-learning group with case-based teaching or a group with face-to-face case-based classroom teaching. After the module the students were required to answer a post-test. Time spent and the number of logged into the system was also measured.Results:For simple recall, all methods were equally effective. For problem-solving, the eCase group achieved a comparable knowledge level to classroom teaching, while textbook learning was inferior to both (p<0.01). The textbook group also spent the least amount of time on acquiring knowledge (33 minutes, p<0.001), while the eCase group spent significantly more time on the subject (53 minutes, p<0.001) and logged into the system significantly more (2.8 vs 1.6, p<0.001).Conclusions:E-learning based cases are an effective tool for teaching complex knowledge and problem-solving ability, but future studies using higher-level e-learning are encouraged.Simple recall skills, however, do not require any particular learning method. © 2013 Bjarne Skjødt Worm.

%X Introduction. Basic comprehensive training of intensive care staff is of great importance to ensure that best practice is maintained. The training of junior medical staff and senior nurses to date, usually takes place at the bedside or on high fidelity simulators only located in major tertiary teaching institutions. Training on these simulators is limited by cost, availability and the small number of users per training session. To address this problem, four partner countries of the CRITICAL Project (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) have developed a Virtual Intensive Care Patient (VIP) which will have access globally via the internet. Method. A virtual patient has been created using EduCAT© Software supplied by a SME Gazebo Computers Ltd who is also a partner in the project. This programme uses a simple toolset designed for teachers, (not programmers), allowing them to modify their own interactive material relatively quickly and cheaply. The project partners will deliver the VIP beginning with four scenarios of Shock to allow intensive care staff to treat a patient using various treatment modalities. Discussion. Junior intensive care staff utilizing the VIP will be able to try alternative treatments for the scenarios and observe patient outcomes faster than in real life, without any danger to patients. The programme can be used by students and junior staff for revision purposes or by teachers for stand-alone teaching sessions or for assessment of competence and confidence of practice. Conclusion. European experts in intensive care will develop and rigorously test the medical scenarios which will be constantly evaluated and refined throughout the project lifecycle. The result will be a screen-based simulation in four languages of a patient available on-line via the CRITICAL website (http://www.critical-project.net) accessed via a log-in code. Teachers will be able to customize the VIP to suit their specialty topic and a collaborative on-line forum for users will provide user feedback and sharing of the latest best practice.

%X In recent years, mobile device-assisted clinical education has become popular among nursing school students. The introduction of mobile devices saves manpower and reduces errors while enhancing nursing students' professional knowledge and skills. To respond to the demands of various learning strategies and to maintain existing systems of education, the concept of Cloud Learning is gradually being introduced to instructional environments. Cloud computing facilitates learning that is personalized, diverse, and virtual. This study involved assessing the advantages of mobile devices and Cloud Learning in a public health practice course, in which Google+ was used as the learning platform, integrating various application tools. Users could save and access data by using any wireless Internet device. The platform was student centered and based on resource sharing and collaborative learning. With the assistance of highly flexible and convenient technology, certain obstacles in traditional practice training can be resolved. Our findings showed that the students who adopted Google+ were learned more effectively compared with those who were limited to traditional learning systems. Most students and the nurse educator expressed a positive attitude toward and were satisfied with the innovative learning method.

%X Learning Objectives: U. S. healthcare spending is not sustainable. ICU's generate 20-30% of medical costs, plagued by overutilization of high-frequency, low-cost lab and imaging tests, which do not result in higher quality of care. We hypothesize that a rounding tool designed to reduce variability and promote best practices for lab and imaging utilization will cut costs and painful procedures, all while improving patient safety and comfort. Methods: We are conducting a cohort study with historic controls, examining effectiveness of a daily rounding checklist in reducing patient “pokes” defined as 1) painful procedures, labs and imaging studies and 2) IV/IM/SQ medications. We included all patients hospitalized in our 25-bed tertiary care PICU. In 2014 our PICU adopted a structured interdisciplinary bedside rounding model, which provided a platform for curbing overutilization. During a set time on rounds, the nurse reports how many “pokes” are anticipated that day and suggests ways to reduce them, followed by a team discussion of the proposed interventions. In addition we conducted an educational campaign and provided a lab pricing “menu” for resident physicians. Our primary outcome was the total number of “pokes” per patient per week. Secondary outcomes included utilization of individual lab and imaging tests and associated costs. Results: In a cohort of 2449 patients and 546 historic controls we observed a decrease in the total number of “pokes” from 21.5 to 19.7 per patient per week, p<0.012. Preliminary analysis of secondary outcomes revealed a decrease in metabolic panels for patients with status asthmaticus (1.70 to 1.19 per patient per day, p<0.0001), while individual potassium checks increased. For patients with hypo/hypernatremia, metabolic panels decreased from 2.06 to 1.73 per patient per day, p<0.0001, with a concomitant increase in individual sodium checks. Conclusions: A checklist tool within the structured interdisciplinary bedside rounding framework, decreased utilization of labs, imaging and painful interventions. Further analysis of ensuing reduction in patient harm and costs, is in progress..

%X New technologies give nurse academicians the opportunity to incorporate innovative teaching-learning strategies into the nursing curricula. Mobile technology for learning, or m-learning, has considerable potential for the nursing classroom but lacks sufficient empirical evidence to support its use. Based on Mayer's multimedia learning theory, the effect of using cooperative and interactive m-learning techniques in enhancing classroom and clinical learning was explored. The relationship between m-learning and students' learning styles was determined through a multimethod educational research study involving nurse practitioner students at two mid-Atlantic universities. During the 16-month period, nurse practitioner students and their faculty used personal digital assistants (PDAs) to participate in various m-learning activities. Findings from focus group and survey responses concluded that PDAs, specifically the Pocket PC, are useful reference tools in the clinical setting and that all students, regardless of learning style, benefited from using PDAs. It was also demonstrated that connecting students with classmates and other nurse practitioner students at distant universities created a cooperative learning community providing additional support and knowledge acquisition. The authors concluded that in order to successfully prepare nurse practitioner graduates with the skills necessary to function in the present and future health care system, nurse practitioner faculty must be creative and innovative, incorporating various revolutionary technologies into their nurse practitioner curricula.

%X Introduction: Blood and marrow transplantation is a low volume, high risk specialty. Insitutional practices vary considerably. Consensus practice is important for physician and family confidence, so as to optimise patient outcomes during stem cell transplantation with best practice and as a platform for research. The 12 paediatric / adolescent transplant centres of the UK and Ireland are increasingly collaborative over the last years as they look to support each other's practice, achieve such consensus and continue and establish research studies. This report summarises the efforts of that groups and commends them to other national paediatric BMT groups. Materials (or patients) and Methods: The Group's activities over the last 7 years are reviewed in the following areas: a) National Audit Meeting in which all transplants performed from the previous year are in a single national meeting attended by physicians, nurses and data managers from each centre. Instructive cases and all transplant related deaths are specifically highlighted. There have been now 7 such annual meetings. An external auditor attends. b) Twice yearly meetings attended by transplant centres in which protocols are drawn up and consensus indications discussed. c) Since 2012 there has been a national, monthly video conference attended by transplant teams. Difficult cases referred for transplant and difficult cases during transplant are discussed. An agenda is circulated in advance of the meeting and a minuted discussion afterwards. A separate video MDT has been held with metabolic disease paediatricians for particular metabolic related SCT cases. d) The group has agreed consensus guidelines for transplant for group members. Immune deficiency is managed in a separate national MDT between the centres of Newcastle and Great Ormond Street. Results: In 7 years all transplants performed in the UK have been discussed at national audit meetings. There is a median of 300 transplants per annum. There is a national, annually updated, indication list for stem cell transplantation in children for National Health Service purchasers. National protocols for stem cell transplant in AML, ALL, haemoglobinopathy, metabolic Diseases and constitutional and acquired aplastic anaemia. Consensus protocols for cord transplant including indication, graft selection, graft processing, directed collection has contributed to increased UK paediatric cord transplantation. There have been 9 national vidoe MDT, held monthly. 47 patients have been discussed - 75% pre-transplant patients where indication, conditioning or donor were the focus of discussion. The remainder were transplanted patients with complications. All centres have attended. There have been 2 such conferences with metabolic disease focus - one discussing patient specific X-ALD questions and one discussing similar questions in MLD. Parallel to these increasing face-to-face contacts there is increasing email contact between the group about difficult patients between meetings. Discussion: We have found these national, increasingly frequent joint meetings to be extremely useful and we commend them to other national groups. We also believe that the opportunity to discuss individual cases with such a national group is not only helpful to patient management but is easily seen - for families and professionals - to be important to patient management and generates confidence in the complicated transplant process.

%X Background/Purpose: China does not have primary medical care and referral system. Patients can choose any hospital or any doctor they like to seek medical care. As a result, most patients with rheumatic diseases rushed to a few large cities. Survey shows more than 40% of the rheumatic disease patients are unnecessary to go to hospital and they only need advices from specialist. Smart System of Disease Management (SSDM) is a series of applications for chronic diseases management, which develop the interaction between doctors and patients. The study shows that, after training, the RA patients can master the SSDM and perform self-management, including DAS28 and HAQ evaluations, as well as medication and lab test data entries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and benefit of the medical economics of online consultation based on SSDM by rheumatologist. Methods: The rheumatologists and nurses implemented the education and training programs on using SSDM and assisted the patients in downloading SSDM APP. The SSDM includes doctors' application and patients' application. The patient application includes self-assessment (DAS28, HAQ), medication management, adverse events management and laboratory records. After data entry, patients can synchronize data to the authorized doctor. On the basis of understanding of the disease activities, medication and laboratory test results, the rheumatologists can accept consultation request from the patients and supply them with advices in forms of text and or telephone call. Results: Between February 14, 2015 and June 12, 2016, 30 rheumatologists supplied 132 patients with 136 times free and 55 paid consultations. In which there were 176 times text Q&A and 15 telephone consultations. Paid consultation included 43 times text Q&A and 12 telephone consultations. The consulting fee ranged from RMB 50 to 500 yuan (USD:RMB =1:6.6) each in average of 275.45 ± 90.20 yuan, which rate match the registration fee in hospital. The total fee for consultations was 15,150 yuan. 75.8% patients receiving online consultation lived in different cities with the rheumatologists. If patients seek medical in hospital, in addition to the registration fees and medical expenses, the mean cost of transportation, accommodation, meals and lost wages was 1081.68 ± 523.28 (200 to 1,800) yuan. The total of cost for all patients would have been 248,250 yuan, which is 15.38 times higher than online consultation. SSDM can save up to 93.90% cost for patients. Survey shows all patients were satisfied and 64.86% of them were “very satisfied” with the consultation services. Conclusion: Using SSDM system to obtain online consultation, Chinese patients with rheumatic disease can enjoy reduced cost with high satisfaction. In the era lack of primary care system in China, SSDM may serve a complimentary platform to control medical care cost, as well as relieve the tensions between health care professionals and patients.

%X Background & Hypothesis: Despite the positive influence of research utilisation on patient outcomes, the literature suggests that nurses infrequently engage in evidence-based practices (EBP). This study aims to understand nurses' reservation about research utilisation, by examining their barriers, perception and knowledge in EBP and the factors influencing these. Methods: A descriptive survey was conducted on 68 nurses with at least 1 year of working experience. Their perception of EBP was measured by the barriers to research utilisation scale (BARRIERS) with scores ranging from 1 to 4, and the evidence-based practice questionnaire (EBPQ) with scores ranging from 1 to 7. Objective measurement of EBP knowledge was attained via the knowledge assessment test (KAT) with scores ranging from 1 to 35. Higher scores reflected greater barriers, EBP perception and knowledge. Results: Nurses reported minimal barriers to research utilisation (BARRIERS M = 2.70, SD = 0.40) and perceived EBP moderately with mean scores ranging from 4.14 to 4.93 on the various subscales. However, they scored relative low on KAT, (M = 14.06, SD = 3.86) suggesting lack in EBP knowledge. KAT scores were affected by prior EBP involvement, t(58) = 2.41, P = 0.02; and education level. ANOVA and posthoc comparison showed that nurses with degree (KAT M = 15.15, SD = 3.88) had better EBP knowledge than nurses with diploma (KAT M = 12.00, SD = 2.81), F(3,58) = 3.28, P = 0.03. Discussion & Conclusion In this study, data on nurses' favourable perception of EBP was triangulated objectively with lowered knowledge scores. A learning platform can be developed to hone nurses' EBP knowledge.

%X Purpose: To find an effective way to develop and improve communication between the infection control team and clinical units in a newly opened university teaching hospital in China. Methods: Running an Infection Control meeting in the last week of each month, most participants were Infection Control Link Nurses (ICLNs) officially but ask other people such as managers and directors from the hospital management to take part in sometimes. The issues for discussion would be collected beforehand. During the meeting, members of ICT delivered and shared new knowledge, skills, information in terms of infection control with other participants. They also did feedback about all the kinds of surveillance data during last month including nosocomial infection, hand hygiene, MDRO, occupational exposure, medical waste. They used half of time to discuss current infection control problems existed from each wards and tried to solve them together. Results: The monthly meeting helped to build the culture related to infection control across the hospital. The health care workers (HCWs) paid more attention to the infection prevention rather than infection control. The ICLNs put the rules and strategies of hospital infection control into the clinical practices. They supervised and improved correct behavior when health care workers did medical procedures. Also ICT developed a few projects to promote hand hygiene, medical waste management, and safe practices among HCWs. Conclusion: Infection control is everyone's business and responsibility, they must work together to get the goal. Monthly meeting improved multi-departments collaboration, it built a new platform to communicate, to learn and to understand, and it saved time, resources and labor too.

%X Objectives: Electrical engineering students are mainly engaged in the production, transmission and distribution of electricity. All kinds of electrical accidents could cause personal injury. In the process of teaching, the basic knowledges of emergency care has not been introduced, so students have no actual combat experience and only wait for the professional rescue personnel in an emergency, it would lead to loss of life-saving valuable time. So, it is necessary to carry out the research for this project. Methods: Firstly, the status of electrical engineering colleges to carry out nursing education was investigated, and the related impact factors of nursing education were analyzed. Secondly, through optimizing the teaching mode and curriculum system, the nursing education core courses were set. And students can master emergency nursing care technology. Thirdly, overall arrangement was made in accordance with the teaching goal. The platform of social practice and the second class was established to train nursing basic skills of emergency nursing care technology. Results: Nursing education is well received by the students. Students have a profound understanding of the necessity of learning in nursing education courses and have improved their ability to emergency nursing. Conclusions: Through the multi-channel, multi-form set of nursing education series elective courses, it has effectively inspired students' interest in learning emergency nursing care technology, and the students' comprehensive quality has been improved greatly.

%X purpose: The U.S. Joint Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require hospitals to notify organ procurement organizations (OPOs) of all patients who have expired, ideally within one hour of death. Delays in tissue donor referrals may result in inadequate time for the OPO to recover optimally viable tissue and can extend the time for release of bodies to funeral homes. This study evaluates the impact of a hospital-wide eLearning training on the timeliness of tissue donor referrals and tissue donation outcomes in a rural, tertiary, 780- bed, level 1 trauma center. Method: A needs assessment revealed a gap in tissue donation education for new and seasoned hospital nurses. The OPO developed a sophisticated, interactive eLearning training that addressed uses for transplantable tissue and the tissue donor referral process. Once uploaded onto its Learning Management System, hospital leaders identified who should take it. Within the first year of implementation, 2535 hospital employees, including 142 Emergency Department (ED) RNs, successfully completed the training. Data were collected 13 months before and after initiation of the training to evaluate timeliness of the referrals. Results: During the 13 months before the training, 20% of ED referrals (n=276), and 24% of all hospital referrals (n=2263) occurred greater than one hour after the patient's death. Thirteen months after initiation of the training, just 16% of ED referrals (n=318), and 21% of all hospital referrals (n=2406) occurred after one hour post-death. In the 13 months after the start of the training, tissue donors increased by 53% in the ED, and 35% overall. The end result was a total increase of 29 tissue donors after the training. Conclusions: This focused hospital-wide eLearning training addressing the tissue donation process reduced the rate of delayed tissue donor referrals, especially in the ED. Timely tissue donor referrals help maximize the quality of tissue and support a timely release of bodies to funeral homes and the family. Most importantly, the training correlated with a significant increase in tissue donors and available transplantable tissue. The results of this single center pilot program represent implications for using this eLearning program in other hospital and hospital systems to affect positive change. (Table presented).

%X Background: Gastric cancer is the second highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Apart from Japan and Korea where screening programs are implemented, most gastric cancer patients worldwide are diagnosed at an advanced stage because of limited knowledge and experience of endoscopists. An internet-based e-learning system to teach detection of early gastric cancer using standard endoscopy has been developed and this study evaluated its effectiveness. Methods: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Participants worldwide signed a consent form before first undertaking a pre-test via the internet, after which they were randomly allocated to the e-learning and non-e-learning groups. Pre-adjustment strata were the pre-test score, experience of endoscopy, being a nurse endoscopist or a medical practitioner, and medical institution and country. Only the participants in the e-learning group were allowed to access the e-learning system, which consisted of video lectures on basic knowledge and self-exercise tests to accumulate experience. A post-test in both groups was conducted 2 months after the pre-test. The pre-determined primary endpoint was the difference in the rate of improvement of the test result (post-test score/pre-test score) between groups. After completion of the post-test, the e-learning system was opened for all participants. Results: Among the 515 endoscopists from 35 countries assessed for eligibility, 322 participants who met the study's inclusion criteria completed the pre-test and were enrolled: 166 were allocated to the e-learning group and 166 to the non-e-learning. Of these, 151 participants in the e-learning group and 144 in the non-e-learning group completed the post-test, and were included in the analysis. The mean rate of improvement (standard deviation) of the test result in the e-learning and non-e-learning groups was 1.24 (0.26) and. 1.00 (0.16), respectively (P<0.001, Student's t-test). Conclusion: This global study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of an e-learning system to improve knowledge and experience on endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer. Its effectiveness will be further evaluated in a study of improvements in the rate of early gastric cancer detection by all participants in actual clinical practice (UMIN: R000012039).

Objectives: A cross-sectional study was done from May-July 2012 to obtain the perceptions and SM usage patterns of oncology practitioners, and their views on how SM can potentially affect clinical practices. Methods: An online survey (14 questions) was sent via an invitation email to MASCC/ISOO members. Participants' demographics, SM usage behavior, perceptions regarding health information on SM channels and on patients' use of SM for supportive care information were obtained. Responses were analyzed using SPSS (v19). Results: Response rate was 16 % (128 people). Most were from Europe (38 %) and America (34 %). Participants were mainly physicians (33 %), nurses (32 %) and pharmacists (12 %). Over half (54 %) had 11-30 years of practice experience. The most popular SM channels were YouTube (69 %) and Wikipedia (68 %). Over half (57 %) encountered patients who searched SM for health information in their practices. Majority felt that SM channels often recommended unproven treatment Methods: and could potentially cause harm to patients (63 % each). However, similar proportions (61 % each) agreed that patients who searched information on SM channels were better empowered to manage their conditions and those who shared experiences on social networking sites could cope better with their supportive care. Conclusions: Certain SM channels (YouTube, Wikipedia) are popular among oncology practitioners. Practitioners are supportive of patients using SM for health information but are concerned regarding its quality. Therefore, patients should be educated on how to utilize these channels appropriately to supplement their cancer care.

%X Introduction: Chronic diseases are also the most important cause of death and burden of disease in Turkey. The rate of obesity frequency was seen 20% for adults in 2014 health survey by TURKSTAT. In the COSI 2013 study obesity is found 22.5% among children aged 7-8 (%14.2 overweight); In school study obesity was found 30.2% (19.5% overweight) in 11-15 years old. In the 18th Development Plan of Turkish Government the 21st priority program is the wellness program which coordinator is the Ministry of Health. Since 2010, healthy nutrition and active living programs has been imple-mented. Diabetes control and salt reduction programs are implemented also. Methods: Within the scope of obesity prevention in Turkey; studies, suc-cesses and challenges were shared. Results: Healthy nutrition and active living program is implemented as the Prime Ministry circular and all sectors are concerned with this program. Studies are carried out on awareness studies; public and in-service training; regulations; developing guidelines, reorganization health services and monitoring. Within awareness and advocacy studies, special days and weeks are cel-ebrated nationwide; walking organisations are held every month in each province by health directorate. In 2015, 40,000; in 2016, 300,000 bicycle was provided for schools; municipalities and universities. Food and beverages standards was developed for school canteens, the sale of cola, fzzy drinks, chocolate, candy in school canteens was prohibited. Since 2012 in the second term of primary schools, school milk and raisin distribution program is applied. Fitnessgram card was improved in secondary school and high school. The Nutrition Guide for Turkey; National Physical Activity Guidelines and Physical Activity Guidelines in Chronic Diseases were prepared. In order to reduce the advertising and marketing pressure for children, the nutrition profile and application guide was prepared because of Law Radio and Television Supreme Council. Labelling regulation was updated in accordance with the EU. In primary health care services, obesity counselling units and wellness centres were established. Diets therapy is given by dieticians. Obesity counselling guideline was developed for family practitioner and nurses. One million were published and distributed. Trainings of trainer (ToT) were held. Obesity in children is monitored within COSI with WHO Euro. National Nutrition and Health Survey was conducted in 2010 and it will be conduct in autumn 2017. The program was evaluated by WHO and the report was printed. Currently, www.saglik.gov.tr; and www.beslenme.gov.tr addresses, social media addresses of the ministry are actively used in public information and awareness. Conclusion: Follow-up of school's regulations should be realized . A school lunch program should be developed. Trans fats should be elimi-nated. In order to increase physical activity in the community, the use of bicycles as a means of transportation should be increased and wide pave-ments with trees should be constructed by municipalities. Infrastructures of schools should be increased in terms of physical activity applications. Pay for prevention must be provided in health services.

%X Background: Modern cancer care requires the development of clinical pathways to enhance coordination, but there are few descriptive studies about the content of coordination activities. More specifically, little is known about hospital discharge coordination, although this is seen as a sensitive phase of clinical pathway. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the categories of activities performed by nurse navigators for hospital discharge coordination. Methods: Patients supported within the Coordinating Outpatient Care department (COC) at Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France). Study conducted over two consecutive phases (Feb-September 2014): (1) a qualitative phase to identify the categories of coordination activities (interviews with patients plus, focus groups with nurse navigators—NNs); (2) a quantitative phase to quantify the relative share of each category. The calls received through the telephone platform of COC (made by both patients and primary care providers) were systematically reported (caller; reason for the call; procedure performed) and then analyzed. Results: Qualitative phase: 17 interviews with patients, plus 2 focus groups with NNs. Quantitative phase: 543 calls analyzed. The callers were patients or their relatives (38 %), private nurses (35 %), medical device providers (20 %), and other primary care providers (e.g., pharmacists, family physicians) (7 %). Five categories of coordination activities identified: (F1) Patient monitoring (29 %); (F2) Helping to navigate (24 %); (F3) Managing technical problems (17 %); (F4) Explaining care protocols (16 %); (F5) Collecting and transmitting the patient medical record information (14 %). Conclusions: The majority of requirements are related to organizational issues (e.g., navigation, lack of information, appointments). Nurse navigators’ training and qualification must therefore combine both clinical and managerial skills.

%X Background: Many studies point out the importance of care coordination, but there are few descriptive studies about the content of coordination activities and how it responds to the needs of patients and professionals. Objectives: To identify the skills and competencies needed to perform home care coordination activities. Methods: The study was conducted at Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France), into the department coordinating outpatient care for patients who need post-discharge home care. In a first step, a data grid was developed (a focus group with the nurses and the head of the department), and then refined during an observation period. After this qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis studied the phone calls received at the coordination platform of this department (May-June 2014). The following data were systematically collected (date; caller; reason for the call; procedure performed), and then analyzed by two researchers. They identified five categories of actions, one clinical (F1), and four related to managerial and, organizational solutions (F2 to F5), validated by the staff members of the department. Results: 543 calls were analyzed. The callers were patients or their relatives (38%), private nurses (35%), medical devices providers (20%), other primary care providers (7%). Five categories of coordination activities were identified: (F1) Patient monitoring and management of clinical and non-clinical alerts (side effects) (32%); (F2) Helping to understand and navigate through the clinical pathway (information about healthcare professional contacts) (21%); (F3) Managing technical problems linked to the achievement of care (problem about medical devices delivery) (17%); (F4) Explaining some elements of the care protocol (use a medical device) (16%); (F5) Collecting and transmitting the patient medical record information (medical prescriptions) (14%). Conclusions: The majority of requirements for patients and professionals are related to managerial and organizational issues (e.g. navigation, lack of information about specific aspects of the clinical pathway). They require the implementation of new professional managerial skills, especially among nurse navigators and other new professions.

%X Cancer clinical trials (CCT) provide much of the evidence for clinical guidelines and standards of care. To achieve optimal patient-centered care, all patients should have access to the latest treatments and the high quality care that typifies CCT. Low levels of CCT participation are well documented, especially for minorities. The barriers to CCT accrual are numerous including patient, provider, and system level factors. To identify provider and system level barriers to CCT accrual and current best practices in recruitment, an online survey was conducted about recruitment practices for population groups represented across the NRG Oncology network. The aims were: 1) to learn more about how sites recruit patients, especially minority/underserved populations, 2) to identify areas where additional training on accrual of minority/underserved populations is needed. The survey was conducted in January 2016 and was sent to 626 NRG Network Lead Research Associates and Local Site Research Associates with 215 submitting a completed survey (34% response rate). Questions were asked about specific recruitment practices, both successful and unsuccessful, required training related to research and cultural competency, methods for eligibility screening, and questions about catchment area. Responses showed that multiple methods were used to improve recruitment for CCT. Almost all respondents (90%) reported using written and verbal methods for disseminating information about trials and CCT recruitment, including posting information on institutional websites, distributing written materials and using patient navigators. Only 7% reported using social media for recruitment. A small proportion (12.9%) used incentives to improve recruitment including money, gift cards, parking and travel reimbursements. The most effective methods reported by respondents for recruiting minority/underserved participants included the use of patient navigators and written materials translated in languages other than English. Most sites (82%) reported using a formal mechanism for eligibility screening with the research nurse (77.7%), principal investigator (63.0%), and/or clinical research associate (49.8%) responsible for screening patients. Most institutions reported using a screening/enrollment tracking system (73.8%) and gathered data on the number of potentially eligible participants, number that were offered a clinical trial, number that agreed or refused to participate, and reasons for refusal. Cultural competency training for research staff was required by 45.5% of respondents. About half of the responding sites used one-on-one CCT training and 25% used courses outside of their institution. Most sites (81.2%) did not use community partners to assist with recruitment of minorities. About half (55%) reported having a defined catchment area with geographic variances ranging from a single county to 5 states. The NRG Oncology online survey provides useful information that could improve trial enrollment and shape future training efforts in recruiting minority/underserved populations to CCT. Specific areas that merit further investigation include; web based methods for CCT recruitment and tracking, cultural competency training, definition of catchment areas, use of patient navigators in recruitment activities, and the role of community members for enhanced CCT enrollment. A number of potential recruitment and training pilot programs will likely be initiated based on the survey results.

%X Objective: We aimed to evaluate a multifaceted education initiative designed to reduce the prophylactic use of metoclopramide. Methods: This was a pre- and post-intervention trial undertaken in a single ED. All ED doctors and nurses were targeted. The intervention comprised a specifically designed, 19-slide 'e-learning module', accessible via the ED intranet, supplemented by in-service training and a range of reminder techniques (posters, emails and drug room flyers). The primary end-point was the proportion of patients administered metoclopramide prophylactically with their initial morphine dose. Data were collected on random samples of patients who received morphine, using explicit medical chart review. Results: Both pre- and post-intervention periods were of 3 month duration. The charts of 146 cases were reviewed in each period. In the post-intervention period: • The proportion of patients administered metoclopramide prophylactically decreased from 22.6% to 4.1% (difference 18.5% [95% CI 10.3-26.7], P < 0.001) • The proportion of patients administered metoclopramide appropriately (for known morphine sensitivity, established nausea and rescue anti-emesis) rose marginally from 28.8% to 32.9% (difference 4.1% [95% CI -7.2-15.4], P = 0.53) • There was a 12.7% decrease in the number of ampoules of metoclopramide issued to the ED without a concurrent rise in the issue of other anti-emetic drugs Conclusion: The education initiative resulted in a significant improvement in the evidence-based use of metoclopramide. © 2009 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine and Australasian Society for Emergency Medicine.

%X Purpose: To determine the effects of virtual reality balance training (VRBT) in treatment of balance dysfunction in elderly with risk of falling and compare these effects with the effects of conventional balance training (CBT). Materials and Methods: Eighteen volunteers who live in Republic Of Turkey, Ministry of Family and Social Studies Narlidere Nursing Home Elderly Care and Rehabilitation Center, aged 65 years&over, with Berg Balance Score (BBS) 45-52 and no serious cardiac, neurologic, pulmonary disease were included. Medical history, cognitive status, basic functional mobility, balance, risk of balance-fall of the elderly were evaluated. Computerized VRBT were given to Virtual Reality Group (VR) whereas Conventional Exercise Group (CE) did simple calisthenics and balance exercises for 3 days/week during 6 weeks. Results: The median (min-max) age of the participants was 72(65-82) years and the median BMI was 26.28 (18.01-40.69) kg/m2. There was no significant difference between baseline results of groups(p>0.05). Following the intervention, BBS increased and risk of falling decreased in both groups (VR p = 0.02, CE p = 0.03). FES-I score decreased only in CE, thus the fear of falling reduced (p = 0.04). VR showed improvements in eyes closed one leg stance duration (right&left)(right&left p = 0.05) compared to CE group. Eyes closed tandem stance duration (p = 0.03) and Timed-Up and Go test scores(p = 0.03) increased in VR. Discussion: Both VRBT and CBT improved balance. VRBT improved static&dynamic balance skills and functional mobility better, compared to CBT. Virtual reality systems can be used as an effective rehabilitation technique for improving balance and reducing risk of falling, by creating safe environments similar to activities of daily living in elderly.

%X OBJECTIVES: There is limited information on effective balance training techniques including virtual reality (VR)-based balance exercises in residential settings and no studies have been designed to compare the effects of VR-based balance exercises with conventional balance exercises in older adults living in nursing homes in Turkey. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of VR-based balance exercises on balance and fall risk in comparison to conventional balance exercises in older adults living in nursing homes. METHODS: A total sample of 18 subjects (65-82 years of age) with fall history who were randomly assigned to either the VR group (Group 1, n = 7) or the conventional exercise group (Group 2, n = 11) completed the exercise training. RESULTS: In both groups, Berg balance score (BBS), timed up & go duration, and left leg stance and tandem stance duration with eyes closed significantly improved with time (p < 0.05), but changes were similar in both groups (p > 0.05) after training, indicating that neither the exercise method was superior. CONCLUSION: Similar improvements were found in balance and fall risk with VR-based balance training and conventional balance training in older adults living in the nursing home. Both exercise trainings can be preferable by health care professionals considering fall prevention. Appropriate patient selection is essential.

%X Background: 70% of Maternal and Child Mortality causes in the developing countries could be prevented if mothers and babies could access the quality MCH care. Accurate knowledge and clinical competency amongst health professionals are keys to reduce preventive tragedies. However training opportunities are very little in these countries, especially in remote area due to lack of resources, the poor infrastructures. Developing low cost and accessible continuing education system is crucial to tackle with the current challenges, and continuity of the sustainable development. We have developed participatory blended program over the last 5 years. Numerous changes from both teaching institutions and clinical practices at forefront had been reported. Methods: Modules of blended MCH seminar program focused on health promotion, risk assessment, prevention, and management were designed in collaboration with professional bodies and four national universities in Mongolia for knowledge and clinical skills translation into local contexts. It is designed with interactive online and face to face seminars between Japan and Mongolia. Moodle which we settled to function as a platform for all participants to access seminar materials, including text documents, seminar videos, and list of references for free of charge. Findings: Over 40 % of all Mongolian nursing profession was able to enroll at least one of these seminars between 2008 and 2013. Using the IT technology reduced both traveling time and cost of Japanese lecturers and Mongolian participants. All seminar credits have been accredited by the Mongolian government for renewal of the license, which was the major cause of reduction of nursing workforce in the remote area over the decades. Findings revealed that there were impacts on both clinical practices and undergraduate curricular, including introduction of parental education classes, better use of MCH handbook which is a combination of growth records throughout pregnancy to delivery, and a child up to 6 years old, and educational part, developing nursing care protocols and introduction of the first nursing diagnosis and nursing records. The first MCH nursing textbook were published and distributed by local partners, and widely used in the country now. Interpretation: Participatory blended seminar program provided platforms for not only the collaborative learning activities and mutual understanding between Japanese and Mongolian professionals and students, but also promoted local communication to understand the problems and possible intervention in Mongolia. Future work is planned to formulate the evaluation indicator of the outcomes.

%X Four years ago a group of trainee haematologists decided to utilise Social Media as a platform for education. Team Haem was born. Clinical scenarios are presented via interactive blogs on twitter and facebook to promote, develop and discuss unique and interesting cases. The result has been the evolution of a rich and diverse community of learners, including undergraduates, nurses, junior doctors, biomedical scientists and consultants spanning many specialities. Team Haem has a truly global appeal and significant presence on social media. There are now circa 2,300 followers from 163 different countries all with unlimited and free access to an interactive knowledge sharing platform. There are numerous advantages to the learner. The asynchronous and international nature of the learning plat form is particularly valuable with increasing clinical demands limiting access to real-time teaching for British trainees. Knowledge and skills of participants are wide ranging allowing a truly multi-disciplinary approach. Reflective practice is also encouraged by this form of learning as participants can discuss and debate key points and share experiences. Team Haem facilitates our followers to explore a topic for their own educational satisfaction by allowing participants to pose questions and engage in discussions, thus creating a more engaging and continuous dialogue. Alongside case discussions, Team Haem aims to promote new innovative developments within haematology and share this knowledge across our diverse community of learners. We regularly post links to journal articles, guidelines, conference hashtags and other learning tools for the benefit of our followers. In our presentation we will introduce the fundamentals of socialmedia as an interactive learning platform and discuss the ongoing and successful evolution of TeamHaem. Come with an open mind and tweet your thoughts! #teamhaem.

%X The NLN Jeffries Framework describing simulation in nursing education has been used widely to guide construction of human patient simulation scenarios and serve as a theoretical framework for research on the use of simulation. This framework was developed with a focus on prelicensure nursing education. However, use of human patient simulation scenarios is also a way of providing practice experiences for graduate students learning the educator role. High-fidelity human patient simulation offers nurse educator faculty a unique opportunity to cultivate the practical knowledge of teaching in an interactive and dynamic environment. This article describes how the components of The NLN Jeffries Framework can help to guide simulation design for nurse educator preparation. Adapting the components of the framework-which include teacher, student, educational practices, design characteristics, and outcomes-helps to ensure that future faculty gain handson experience with nurse educator core competencies. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X Objective: To demonstrate that evidence-based medicine (EBM) training can be imparted in developing countries using minimal resources. Design: Development of a minimal cost workshop with validation of gain in EBM skills using the Berlin questionnaire. Setting: Teaching hospital in Pakistan. Participants: Multidisciplinary faculty from The Shifa College of Medicine and Nursing, Pakistan. Intervention: A 14-hour locally-tailored McMaster-style workshop, using a problem-based, learner-focused small group format, with pre- and post-workshop evaluation of EBM skills. Results: Analysis of the pre- and post-Berlin questionnaires of the participants revealed that the pre-workshop Berlin questionnaire score for the group was 4.7±2.3, with a post-workshop Berlin score of 7.6±1.0 (p<0.001). Conclusion: EBM workshops can be locally-tailored in developing countries, where access to such workshops is generally not available. Workshops can serve to promote EBM skills in faculty, who can then help to disseminate and model concepts. The process increases awareness and interest in EBM, which in this case resulted in formation of a national platform for EBM. © Z Zaidi, M Iqbal, J Hashim, M Quadri, 2009.

%X Ischemic heart disease in European countries over decades causes up to 55% of all cases of sudden death and also has a high rate of mortality, morbidity, and hospital admission. Patients with such chronic diseases also require intensive home care facilities from community nurses. The aim was to establish international multilingual platform for transtelephonic ECG system as an alternative solution for home care and assess its performance. METHODS. During this pilot study, the international toll-free line between Lithuania and Germany was established, and practical applicability of the tele-ECG device was tested. Transtelephonic ECG system was implemented between Telemedicine Center in Bad Segeberg (Bad Segeberg Clinic, Germany), the Call Center in Kaunas at the Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine, and a patient residence. RESULTS. Over a 6-month follow-up period, 34 patients were recruited. Following the ECG transmission, 86 teleconsultations were done. During the study, a total of 329 ECGs were sent by the patients; out of them, 14 ECGs were with clinical changes. Technical problems due to insufficient patient training, telecommunication systems, acoustic data transmission, and device itself were reported. Up to 23% of ECGs sent by patients were unreadable and not applicable for further clinical analysis. CONCLUSIONS. Our study showed the potential of telemedicine facilities to overcome the problems of access that makes the technique so potentially useful, but for telemonitoring application at patient homes in a wider population, it needs to be improved in terms of technical performance, transmission and analysis automatization.

%X Objective: A supermarket chain is the first retail environment in the northeastern region of the United States to house on-site telehealth stations (THS) providing patients with on-demand, face-to-face access to prescribers/nurses through web-based telemedicine in an environment that meets security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act security requirements and is handicapped accessible. Using innovative THS technology, the supermarket pharmacy developed and will evaluate telepharmacy MTM services. The primary objective is to determine the short-term (3-month) return on investment (ROI). Secondary objectives include process and clinical outcome measures. Methods: THS MTM services include: patient creation of personal health record (PHR), comprehensive medication review (CMR), provision of personal medication record and medication action plan to the patient, physician intervention, and documentation. New patients opting in will create a PHR within the THS including the following data: family history, surgical history, health conditions, medications, and allergies. THS collects biometrics: blood pressure (BP), pulse, weight, temperature, and pulse oximetry, and assesses health risk. Pharmacists connected via THS can access PHR and biometric information during the CMR session. Following the CMR, patients can access their PHR via the Internet. ROI data analysis at 3 months will include costs (pharmacist and technician time, salary/benefits, technology needs, marketing) and revenue generated. Personnel time will include: training, preparation, direct patient contact, and documentation time. Process measures include: number of patients, medicationrelated problems (MRP), and patient satisfaction. The MTM-contracted platform allows tracking and documentation of MRPs in a standardized method. THS will administer a validated patient satisfaction questionnaire following the CMR. Clinical outcome measures include biometrics (BP, pulse, weight) obtained from the THS at baseline and 3 months. Changes in hemoglobin A1C and cholesterol will be determined from laboratory data.

%X Given the demographic changes in society, it is becoming increasingly important to treat the ever-growing number of multimorbid elderly patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes using state of the art medical know-how, both efficiently and while taking quality of life into consideration. In this respect, newer technologies like the Internet, ambient assisted living or telemonitoring play an increasing role also for the elderly. The qualification of carers - both professional and lay - for the growing number of elderly people is a significant challenge for the future. Three running projects on e-learning for nurses, internet-based benchmarking and telemonitoring in care homes are presented, providing an overview of future-oriented technologies on the basis of examples. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

%X Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is the major complication of central venous catheters (CVC). The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of a hospital-wide strategy on CLABSI reduction. Between 2008 and 2011, all CVCs were observed individually and hospital-wide at a large university-affiliated, tertiary care hospital. CVC insertion training started from the 3rd quarter and a total of 146 physicians employed or newly entering the hospital were trained in simulator workshops. CVC care started from quarter 7 and a total of 1274 nurses were trained by their supervisors using a web-based, modular, e-learning programme. The study included 3952 patients with 6353 CVCs accumulating 61,366 catheter-days. Hospital-wide, 106 patients had 114 CLABSIs with a cumulative incidence of 1.79 infections per 100 catheters. We observed a significant quarterly reduction of the incidence density (incidence rate ratios [95% confidence interval]: 0.92 [0.88-0.96]; P<0.001) after adjusting for multiple confounders. The incidence densities (n/1000 catheter-days) in the first and last study year were 2.3/1000 and 0.7/1000 hospital-wide, 1.7/1000 and 0.4/1000 in the intensive care units, and 2.7/1000 and 0.9/1000 in non-intensive care settings, respectively. Median time-to-infection was 15 days (Interquartile range, 8-22). Our findings suggest that clinically relevant reduction of hospital-wide CLABSI was reached with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and multimodal quality improvement programme including aspects of behavioural change and key principles of good implementation practice. This is one of the first multimodal, multidisciplinary, hospital-wide training strategies successfully reducing CLABSI. © 2014 Zingg et al.

%X Background: Vulnerable older adults continue to be a growing population in the oncology clinic. Geriatric assessment (GA) can help identify older adults who are at high risk of toxicity from cancer treatment. Despite this, there remains no well-established framework to guide the integration of GA into the care of older patients with cancer. Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted on quantitative and qualitative data collected from surveys of the first two rounds of a Delphi consensus study on the use of GA in clinical practice to summarize important themes. Study participants (N=33) were geriatric oncology experts who attended NIH-funded U13 or Cancer and Aging Research Group conferences, out of which 32 completed round 1 and 30 completed round 2. Results: 24/32 oncology experts used GA in the clinical care of older patients with cancer. Most commonly, GA was performed by a geriatrician or geriatric oncologist as a consultative service. Ideal processes for GA completion included a patient self-reported portion, either on a web-based or tablet platform at home or in the office, followed by performance based testing in the clinic. Experts included the following interdisciplinary members on their teams: social work (52.4%), nursing (45.8%), pharmacy (41.7%), a nurse practitioner (37.5%), nutrition (37.5%) and either physical or occupational therapy (16.5%). 59% used GA to categorize patient fitness into fit/vulnerable/ frail groups. GA is used to inform oncology treatment decisions such as: determining the cancer-based treatment vs symptom-directed treatment, identifying supportive care interventions, and predicting toxicity/functional decline from treatment. Time, lack of resources: funding for data-collection and data-management technology, well trained staff, and clinic space, as well as resistance to refer were the most frequently cited barriers impacting the feasibility and sustainability of integrating GA into the care workflow. Conclusion: Several barriers continue to limit the use of GA even by geriatric oncology experts. Expert perspectives however provide information on how GA might be integrated sustainably into the clinical care of older adults in the oncology setting.

%X Improving the health of children in foster care requires close collaboration between pediatrics and the child welfare system. Propelled by recent health care and child welfare policy reforms, there is a strong foundation for more accountable, collaborative models of care. Over the last 2 decades health care reforms have driven greater accountability in outcomes, access to care, and integrated services for children in foster care. Concurrently, changes in child welfare legislation have expanded the responsibility of child welfare agencies in ensuring child health. Bolstered by federal legislation, numerous jurisdictions are developing innovative cross-system workforce and payment strategies to improve health care delivery and health care outcomes for children in foster care, including: (1) hiring child welfare medical directors, (2) embedding nurses in child welfare agencies, (3) establishing specialized health care clinics, and (4) developing tailored child welfare managed care organizations. As pediatricians engage in cross-system efforts, they should keep in mind the following common elements to enhance their impact: embed staff with health expertise within child welfare settings, identify long-term sustainable funding mechanisms, and implement models for effective information sharing. Now is an opportune time for pediatricians to help strengthen health care provision for children involved with child welfare.

%X Background and aims Neuromonitoring, using amplitude-integrated Electroencephalography (aEEG) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS), is common practice on our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The quality of the registration depends on the application of the aEEG-needles or hydrogel electrodes and the NIRS-pad, handling the equipment and interpretation of the registration. Incorrect placement of the electrodes (too close to each other) by untrained nursing staff can lead to a registration full of artefacts, which may be interpreted as epileptic events or epileptic events may be missed. The correct interpretation of the aEEG patterns has a complex learning curve. Method An e-learning course about monitoring the neonatal brain was developed to ensure that nurses are able to learn at any time, at any place on any computer. The hospital provided an e-learning-team. The e-learning course is located at a virtual learning environment which every member of the hospital staff has access to. Results We developed an e-learning course which provides an interactive teaching tool to learn all about the near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) and four different aEEG monitor devices. Quizzes are included to practice how to interpret the aEEG recordings, which is essential in evaluating the monitoring of the neonatal brain. Conclusion E-learning is an interactive learning tool which will enable the staff to keep their skills up to date in using different NIRS- and aEEG monitors and will allow correct interpretation of the aEEG recordings.

%X Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease of major medical and public health importance worldwide. We have developed and tested three low-cost informatics tools in Nicaragua to help improve laboratory, surveillance and clinical management practices to reduce dengue-related morbidity and mortality. As part of the Dengue FIRST initiative (Fighting Infections through Research, Science and Technology), these tools were developed collaboratively between the NGO the Sustainable Sciences Institute and the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua. Input from stakeholders at the national, state and local levels was incorporated at multiple phases. “DENGUE-ALERT” is an innovative automated early warning system for outbreak detection and response that provides a customizable “dashboard” with information from traditional epidemiological disease reports and entomological, climatic and crowd-sourced data. It targets a wide range of end-users including public health and community-based actors and is designed to enable earlier detection and reporting of virus circulation or outbreak indicators to increase the efficiency of response and resource use. “DENGUE-SPECIALIST” is a web-based mobile application designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical data access and analysis in hospitalized dengue cases. End-users are clinicians and nurses in public sector hospitals. Simulations of SPECIALIST were tested with data from multiple years of a clinical study in a Nicaraguan public hospital. “DENGUE-LAB” is a web-based platform that supports a national-level information management system for integrating laboratory results and reporting to streamline information flow around the numerous tests used for dengue diagnosis. LAB is designed to improve quality control measures, simplify and automate some of the complexities of dengue diagnosis, and impact both the quality and the reliability of diagnostic results. Both quantitative and qualitative indicators were used in a mixed method evaluation of the pilot of these tools to assess their ability to support earlier and more accurate disease response and outbreak prevention. Following this design and testing phase, the goal is to extend the use of these tools to Mexico and to other Central American countries that are interested and able to adapt and implement “customized” versions of ALERT, SPECIALIST and LAB as appropriate in their country contexts.

%X Study Objectives: An estimated 400,000 to 800,000 needlestick injuries annually in the US involves health care workers. Although percutaneous injury are a common occurrence in the emergency department (ED), there is a large discrepancy between the number of actual events and the events reported to employee health. Despite the potentially serious consequences of percutaneous injury, practitioners often downplay the occurrence and do not report exposures. This study was conducted in order to investigate needlestick incidence and the resident's attitude associated with reporting injuries. It was also designed to investigate negative connotations associated with percutaneous injury. Methods: Using an Internet-based platform, a voluntary anonymous survey was distributed amongst all current allopathic emergency medicine residents in the state of Illinois during January to February of 2011. Each resident was sent a maximum of 3 requests for survey responses. Statistical comparisons between groups used Student-t, Chi-squared, or Fisher test with significance at 0.05. Results: 304 surveys were distributed, 5 were incomplete and 208 were returned for a response rate of 68.4%. Overall, 55.3% of respondents had at least one percutaneous injury with a mean of 1.73 sticks per resident. Of those who had a needlestick, 36.5% of respondents did not report it. Significantly more residents who failed to report perceived possible risk to be low (90.2% versus 40.3%; P<.001). Fear of negative repercussions (P = 0.350) and lack of comfort with a procedure (P= 1.00) did not influence residents' decisions to report their percutaneous injury. Only 5.8% of respondents felt that it is more unacceptable for a physician to get a needlestick compared to a nurse or EMT and only 5.4% of residents think needlestick injuries affect attendings' confidence in their abilities to perform procedures. Only 16.9% of residents would judge their peers procedurally less competent if they had one or more needlesticks but 24.3% would be embarrassed if fellow residents knew they had a percutaneous injury Conclusion: Over half of all ED residents report at least one percutaneous injury during their training; however, over a third of these residents do not report the percutaneous injury. The primary reason that residents who failed to report was a self-perceived risk to be low. Fear of negative repercussions and lack of comfort with a procedure do not seem to influence report of percutaneous injury.

%X Although e-learning is an innovation that is worth making generally available, it is not always accepted by nursing students. Many researchers state that voluntariness is closely related to the individual level of adoption of innovations. Hence, we hypothesized that voluntariness moderates the effect of perceived attributes of innovations (e.g. relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability), which determines the acceptance of e-learning. To test the hypothesis a survey involving two groups of nursing students was carried out. For the first group the usage of e-learning was mandatory, for the second group it was optional. The results confirm our hypothesis. Institutions, interested in e-learning initiatives, should consider the effect of voluntariness when implementing e-learning. This paper provides a useful reference that can help e-learning providers to develop guidelines that can improve the acceptance of e-learning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
