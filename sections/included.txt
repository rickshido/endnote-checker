%X INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of serious game computer simulation training in teaching electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) interpretation skills and the clinical action decisions associated with each abnormality. The use of novel technology like virtual reality, e-learning, and serious gaming can offer improvement in the learning outcomes. METHODS: OB/GYN nurses and physicians were randomized to either in-lab simulation group or serious game group in Phase 1 and received group-specific education on EFM interpretation and decisionmaking. After a minimum 3-month decay period participants completed Phase 2, a well-established in-situ team training drill in which they had to interpret EFM tracings and manage the patient accordingly. Participants were scored on their interpretations and decisionmaking of the EFM tracings during the in-situ team training drill. Participant scores were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Survey results were analyzed with the Chi square test or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The primary outcome was percent correct in EFM strip interpretation and decision-making recorded during the in-situ team training sessions. In comparing overall performance between the groups, the serious game participants scored 55.8% and the simulation lab participants scored 61.6%. There were no significant differences detected (p = 0.43), however this study was under powered. CONCLUSION: The use of serious games in delivery of education to healthcare providers is a viable alternative to delivery of education in large simulation laboratories. Our serious game participants performed similarly to our in-lab simulation participants. Studies with larger numbers of participation are needed.

%X National guidelines inform us that all patients suspected of having a stroke should have their swallow screened within 4 hours of admission. The Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) service on a London Hyperacute Stroke Unit (HASU) has competing demands of clinical work and staff training, which can result in delays for new staff nurses accessing swallow screen training. Creation of an eModule to replace face to face teaching aims to increase timely access to training and provide a flexible system of self-directed learning for nursing staff. A joint project is currently being undertaken by the HASU SLT and Education Technology Department. Content of face to face classroom teaching has been shared with the Elearning Designer for transformation into an eModule via storyboarding and infographics. When launched, the eModule will be accessed by new Staff Nurses via the Trust's learning portal. Results will be available by December 2015 following completion of the project. Analysis of successful implementation will include measuring time from new staff nurses commencing their role on the HASU to accessing swallow screen training, collecting numbers of new staff nurses accessing the eModule independent of SLT time and gathering staff feedback on the experience of using the eModule.

%X Background and Aims: At the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), a policy named “Pain management” states that all health care professionals are accountable for pain management. To train nursing staff, a pilot e-learning program on pain management was created. Methods: Different entities were involved with the training construction: clinical staff of Traumatology wards, Continuing education department and pain project manager. Pilot training consists of 17 short videos of about 5 minutes each deposited on an e-learning platform. An identical questionnaire is filled in before and after each video in order to test gain knowledge at pre-post viewing. The program is available during 21/2 months from inside and outside hospital. Staff can train during their shift. Topics were: definition, assessment, management of acute pain and specialized techniques. Teams' training participation is voluntary but strongly encouraged. Team leaders' and trainers' support is specially marked during the training's period. Results: 3 indicators demonstrate the pilot training's pertinence: high participation rate, increases in knowledge rates in pre- and post questionnaires, and a very positive satisfaction rate regarding the pilot training's format. Traumatology team leaders noticed a better pain anticipation and pain management assessment, as well as the development of a more elaborate professional positioning regarding pain and pain management. Conclusions: This program tested by the traumatology ward at CHUV was very successful. Supportive clinical leadership is a key element of program success. A long term evaluation of knowledge retention is being developed. The program is easily transferrable to other wards.

%X Aims and objectives. To detect problems when classifying pressure ulcers and to examine whether an e-learning program is able to increase the classification skills of qualified nurses and nursing students. Background. Both the distinction between pressure ulcer grades and the differentiation between moisture lesions is difficult. Misclassification and incorrect identification of the lesions results in inadequate preventive and therapeutic measures. Education and training are important for spreading evidence-based insights about this topic. Design. Repeated measure design, consisting of one pretest and three posttests. Methods. The experimental intervention consisted of a one-hour session during which the participants independently went over an e-learning program. The control intervention consisted of a one-hour lecture. Both interventions had the same learning contents. A convenience sample of 212 qualified nurses and 214 final-year nursing students was randomly assigned to an experimental-and a control group. Results. In the pretest, the classification skills were low. After the intervention, these skills improved significantly in both groups. The nursing students achieved better results when using the e-learning program. Among the qualified nurses, there was no difference between the learning methods. Although the classification skills decreased in the posttests, they did not drop under the level of the pretest. Conclusion. The actual classification system does not provide the necessary information about the severity of a pressure ulcer. The differential diagnosis between a moisture lesion was complicated. The classification skills of the qualified nurses and nursing students increased by both learning methods. Repetition remains, however, necessary. Relevance to clinical practice. Both instruction methods are adequate to acquire the knowledge about the differences between moisture lesions and pressure ulcers. E-learning allows studying in one's own time and place, and could therefore be very suitable for repetition of the training. How to organise this training could be a subject for further research. © 2008 The Authors.

%X BACKGROUND: It has previously been shown that nurses can learn clinical nursing skills by e-learning (online), and that many variables will influence how well nurses adopt learned clinical skills using distance education.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify and measure the strength of those factors which would simultaneously influence registered nurses' (RNs') beliefs about their own learning about buttonhole cannulation, using e-learning.
DESIGN: An online Likert style survey consisting of a list of statements related to knowledge and skill domains considered crucial in the area of buttonhole cannulation was distributed to 101 RNs before and after completing an e-learning programme. Participants were required to identify their current level of self-confidence in relationship to each of the statements.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures of RNs' self-rated abilities to assess and implement buttonhole cannulation after completing a related e-learning program were tested using a Partial Least Squares Analysis (PLS-PATH) programme.
RESULTS: The study's results strongly identify that the nurses' ability to meet both clinical and educational outcomes of the renal e-learning module can be predicted by six variables, none of which are directly related to the participants' demographic or clinical backgrounds.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of e-learning to teach clinical skills to RNs, and demonstrate the value of Partial Least Squares Analysis in determining influential learning factors.

%X Background: High quality health care demands a nursing workforce with sound clinical skills. However, the clinical competency of newly qualified nurses continues to stimulate debate about the adequacy of current methods of clinical skills education and emphasises the need for innovative teaching strategies. Despite the increasing use of e-learning within nurse education, evidence to support its use for clinical skills teaching is limited and inconclusive. Objectives: This study tested whether nursing students could learn and retain the theory and skill of handwashing more effectively when taught using computer-assisted learning compared with conventional face-to-face methods. Design: The study employed a two group randomised controlled design. The intervention group used an interactive, multimedia, self-directed computer-assisted learning module. The control group was taught by an experienced lecturer in a clinical skills room. Data were collected over a 5-month period between October 2004 and February 2005. Knowledge was tested at four time points and handwashing skills were assessed twice. Setting and participants: Two-hundred and forty-two first year nursing students of mixed gender; age; educational background and first language studying at one British university were recruited to the study. Participant attrition increased during the study. Results: Knowledge scores increased significantly from baseline in both groups and no significant differences were detected between the scores of the two groups. Skill performance scores were similar in both groups at the 2-week follow-up with significant differences emerging at the 8-week follow-up in favour of the intervention group, however, this finding must be interpreted with caution in light of sample size and attrition rates. Conclusion: The computer-assisted learning module was an effective strategy for teaching both the theory and practice of handwashing to nursing students and in this study was found to be at least as effective as conventional face-to-face teaching methods. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Aim.: In this paper, we tested the over-arching hypothesis that progressive self-guided learning offers equivalent learning benefit vs. proficiency-based training while limiting the need to set proficiency standards. Background.: We have shown that self-guided learning is enhanced when students learn on simulators that progressively increase in fidelity during practice. Proficiency-based training, a current gold-standard training approach, requires achievement of a criterion score before students advance to the next learning level. Methods.: Baccalaureate nursing students (n = 15/group) practised intravenous catheterization using simulators that differed in fidelity (i.e. students' perceived realism). Data were collected in 2008. Proficiency-based students advanced from low- to mid- to high-fidelity after achieving a proficiency criterion at each level. Progressive students self-guided their progression from low- to mid- to high-fidelity. Yoked control students followed an experimenter-defined progressive practice schedule. Open-ended students moved freely between the simulators. One week after practice, blinded experts evaluated students' skill transfer on a standardized patient simulation. Group differences were examined using analyses of variance. Results.: Proficiency-based students scored highest on the high-fidelity post-test (effect size = 1·22). An interaction effect showed that the Progressive and Open-ended groups maintained their performance from post-test to transfer test, whereas the Proficiency-based and Yoked control groups experienced a significant decrease (P < 0·05). Surprisingly, most Open-ended students (73%) chose the progressive practice schedule. Conclusion.: Progressive training and proficiency-based training resulted in equivalent transfer test performance, suggesting that progressive students effectively self-guided when to transition between simulators. Students' preference for the progressive practice schedule indicates that educators should consider this sequence for simulation-based training. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X A better understanding of the relationships between symptom recognition, nursing response, and preferred thinking style is needed to improve nursing education practices. Final semester nursing students (N = 29) completed a high fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) scenario; recognized symptoms (i.e., dyspnea) and responses (i.e., apply oxygen) were recorded, and compared with students' preferred thinking style using the Rational-Experiential Inventory-40. Relationships between concepts were explored. Significant relationships were noted between preference for Rational thinking styles and symptom recognition (p < .05). Preferred thinking style was not related to numbers of therapeutic responses. Thirty percent of students delayed application of oxygen until directed to do so by members of the health care team. Students having a stronger preference for rational thinking demonstrate greater accuracy in cue recognition. More nursing research is needed to explore the cognitive processing during simulation.

%X Perioperative nurses must use critical thinking and sound clinical judgment to meet their patients' needs safely and effectively. This requires the integration and continual updating of large amounts of detailed clinical information. Innovative education strategies are designed to make teaching and learning more interesting and interactive, especially for the presentation of complex subject material. One interactive educational strategy is the use of games. Educational games can foster collaboration and critical thinking among peers and associates. An example of this was the Perioperative QuizBowl: Evidence-Based Practice presented at the annual AORN Congress from 2003 to 2010, which was used to teach and reinforce evidence-based practice in a fun, competitive way. Although AORN no longer presents this offering, the QuizBowl format demonstrates how educational games can support clinical practice. © 2011 AORN, Inc.

%X Development of virtual-reality medical applications is usually a complicated and labour intensive task. This paper explores the feasibility of using commodity physics engine to develop a suturing simulator prototype for manual skills training in the fields of nursing and medicine, so as to enjoy the benefits of rapid development and hardware-accelerated computation. In the prototype, spring-connected boxes of finite dimension are used to simulate soft tissues, whereas needle and thread are modelled with chained segments. Spherical joints are used to simulate suture's flexibility and to facilitate thread cutting. An algorithm is developed to simulate needle insertion and thread advancement through the tissue. Two-handed manipulations and force feedback are enabled with two haptic devices. Experiments on the closure of a wound show that the prototype is able to simulate suturing procedures at interactive rates. The simulator is also used to study a curvature-adaptive suture modelling technique. Issues and limitations of the proposed approach and future development are discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

%X Nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is a common clinical procedure where a plastic tube is inserted into the stomach through the nostril for feeding or drainage. However, the placement is a blind process in which the tube may be mistakenly inserted into other locations, leading to unexpected complications or fatal incidents. The placement techniques are conventionally acquired by practising on unrealistic rubber mannequins or on humans. In this paper, a virtual reality based training simulation system is proposed to facilitate the training of NGT placement. It focuses on the simulation of tube insertion and the rendering of the feedback forces with a haptic device. A hybrid force model is developed to compute the forces analytically or numerically under different conditions, including the situations when the patient is swallowing or when the tube is buckled at the nostril. To ensure real-time interactive simulations, an offline simulation approach is adopted to obtain the relationship between the insertion depth and insertion force using a non-linear finite element method. The offline dataset is then used to generate real-time feedback forces by interpolation. The virtual training process is logged quantitatively with metrics that can be used for assessing objective performance and tracking progress. The system has been evaluated by nursing professionals. They found that the haptic feeling produced by the simulated forces is similar to their experience during real NGT insertion. The proposed system provides a new educational tool to enhance conventional training in NGT placement.

%X An evidence-based interprofessional educational (IPE) intervention involving first year undergraduate students studying medicine, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy was piloted at the University of Liverpool. Campbell's phased approach and Complexity Theory guided development of the intervention and its evaluation. The intervention included a staff-training programme, e-learning materials and interprofessional team working skills workshops. A multi method study design was used to evaluate outcomes and the processes by which the outcomes had transpired. The first year cohort of students (n = 442) was invited to attend the pilots. Fifty-four per cent (n = 237) opted to attend. Findings showed that the intervention promoted theoretical learning about team working. It enabled the students to learn with and from each other (p < 0.001), it significantly raised awareness about collaborative practice (p < 0.05), and its link to improving the effectiveness of care delivery (p < 0.01). The qualitative data showed that it served to increase students' confidence in their own professional identity and helped them to value difference making them better prepared for clinical placement. The findings support the need to start IPE early in students' training before professional doctrines have been built into their learning. As a result of the findings, the intervention has become compulsory for students to attend and the project has evolved to include trained service users/carers as co-facilitators of the workshops. It is also working on strengthening e-learning by integrating the generic materials into the curricula of all courses. Alongside this, strategies are being explored for interprofessional learning in practice. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

%X Patient simulation is increasingly used in the education of healthcare providers, yet few studies have compared simulation to other teaching modalities. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in knowledge acquisition and student satisfaction between two methods of teaching the principles of mechanical ventilation to advanced practice nursing (APN) students: high-fidelity patient simulation (including face-to-face instruction) versus an online, narrated PowerPoint presentation. Twenty APN students were randomized to either the simulation or online teaching method in this pre/posttest study. Measures included a 12-item knowledge questionnaire and a 5-item satisfaction survey. Both groups had significant improvement in knowledge scores from pretest to posttest, but knowledge scores were not significantly different at posttest between groups. Student satisfaction with their learning method was significantly higher in the simulation group. Students choosing to participate in the alternative teaching method after study completion preferred the simulation to the online method.

%X Human patient simulation (HPS) is used in health care education to enhance the transition from classroom learning to competent performance. It has been used frequently in nursing and medical schools and less often in pharmacy and other allied health professions. HPS is used to improve the development of pharmacy practice skills such as physical assessment, pharmacotherapy plan development, and monitoring plans. Engaging multiple health care disciplines in simulations enables participants to practice teamwork and communication skills that are essential in preventing errors and events of harm to patients. This article reviews current literature and use of simulation in pharmacy curricula for the development, enhancement, and assessment of pharmacy practice skills.

%X This exploratory descriptive study aimed at assessing the performance of undergraduate students in the fourth year of the Nursing course to carry out a vein puncture technique with the support of three digital educational materials--hypertext, educational games, and simulations. The sample consisted of 37 students, who had studied the digital material in an IT laboratory and had carried out the procedure of peripheral vein puncture in training laboratory. Ten stages considered essential for the accomplishment of the procedure were observed, and an assessment form of the educational materials was analyzed. Thirty three (89.19%) subjects had never done vein puncture, and 27 (72.97%) correctly performed five or more stages of the procedure. As to visualizing and saving the educational materials in the computer, 12 (32.44%) and 15 (40.54%) students, respectively, said to have had some kind of difficulty. According to 91.90% of the students, the material aided their learning process, which demonstrates this learning tool can be explored and more frequently used.

This article describes the collaborative development and implementation of an interactive online learning package to understand the key role nurses have in recognising and then starting to apply the Sepsis Six care bundle in clinical practice. The e-learning package, developed in a UK teaching hospital, uses a case study approach to address the knowledge that is required to be able to recognise sepsis, to understand the processes that occur and the ongoing care and treatment required. The package is relevant to final-year student nurses, newly registered nurses in preceptorship and other health professionals involved in assessing and treating patients who may be developing sepsis.

%X Aim: To develop a formal web based, training module for all aspects of vascular access maintenance and surveillance, including teaching and accreditation Background: Local programs for pre-emptive screening and surveillance of fistulas exist to a variable extent in renal units in Australia. The practical skills and theoretical knowledge required to adequately initiate and maintain a surveillance program is gained “on the job”. A haemodialysis nurse is usually tasked with the responsibility of maintaining such a program often without any prior training or standardized formal instruction. A formal instructive medium such as a computer based teaching and assessment module will help initiate a standardized process of imparting specific theoretical knowledge and skills. Method: A cross platform HTML5 web based smartphone compatible software package was purchased. Interactive content including video footage, hot spot pictures and illustrations were used to create a web based module. In collaboration with an existing Nephrology Educator Network (NEN) teaching module and utilising some of the content, a new interactive program was developed. Results: Below are screenshots from the interactive module. Conclusion: This web based smartphone and tablet compatible educational module would prove to be useful to standardise practice and improve knowledge regarding vascular access and surveillance.

%X This paper details the results of the first phase of a project that used eLearning to support students' learning within a simulated environment. The locus was a purpose built Clinical Simulation Laboratory (CSL) where the School's newly adopted philosophy of Problem Based Learning (PBL) was challenged through lecturers reverting to traditional teaching methods. The solution, a student-centred, problem-based approach to the acquisition of clinical skills was developed using learning objects embedded within web pages that substituted for lecturers providing instruction and demonstration. This allowed lecturers to retain their facilitator role, and encouraged students to explore, analyse and make decisions within the safety of a clinical simulation. Learning was enhanced through network communications and reflection on video performances of self and others. Evaluations were positive, students demonstrating increased satisfaction with PBL, improved performance in exams, and increased self-efficacy in the performance of nursing activities. These results indicate that an elearning approach can support PBL in delivering a student centred learning experience.

%X Forensic nursing is a nursing specialty that provides services to a variety of patient populations who have experienced violence, including interpersonal violence, sudden or unexpected death, and motor vehicle collisions. However, many critical care nurses have received the background knowledge or practical skills required to provide the level of care required by many forensic patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in knowledge or practical competence exist between participants using 2 different learning modalities: medium fidelity simulation versus face-to-face lecture. Participants who were enrolled in an elective online forensic nursing science course were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The 18 intervention group participants were given three 2-hour forensic simulation sessions in the laboratory. The 17 control group participants attended 3 face-to-face lectures covering forensic science topics. All study participants also received the same forensic course content via the online Blackboard platform. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in either knowledge or practical competency. The lack of results may have been heavily influenced by the small sample size, which resulted in insufficient power to detect possible differences.

%X This article presents and analyses a training system aiming at acquiring skills in nursing cares. The aims followed are the development: --of an active pedagogic method: learning through problems (LTP); --of the interdisciplinary and intercultural approach, the same problems being solves by students from different disciplines and cultures; --of the use of the new technologies of information and communication (NTIC) so as to enable a maximal "distance" cooperation between the various partners of the project. The analysis of the system shows that the pedagogic aims followed by LTP are reached. The pluridisciplinary and pluricultural approach, to be optimal, requires great coordination between the partners, balance between the groups of students from different countries and disciplines, training and support from the tutors in the use of the distance teaching platform.

%X This evaluation research focused on methods for improving simulation instruction by determining if students ' knowledge about simulation subject matter improved and was retained following a simulation experience. Using a pretest/posttest approach, NCLEX-style questions pertaining to the simulation subject matter content were administered to nursing students from two prelicensure nursing courses immediately preceding the simulation, immediately following the simulation, and then again at their final examinations. These findings have helped faculty determine when their simulation instruction is effective and have provided a guide for revising their simulation teaching. While this pretest/posttest method offers insight into student learning outcomes, it perhaps more importantly creates a systematic approach for evaluating simulation instruction.

%X Background and Purpose: Evidence-based medical education is not as causal and universal as evidence-based medicine; the advantages of new educational methods and interventions must be translated into particular contexts of use before they can be truly assimilated. Virtual patients constitute a well established and increasingly well researched design for learning and assessment but their uptake has been very uneven. Methodology: The 'Pathways for Interactive Narrative Education' (PINE) Project was established to ground the development and use of virtual patient designs in the institutions providing healthcare education in Northern Ontario. Funded by Inukshuk Wireless and an Interprofessional Education initiative at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine the 12-month project engaged 75 authors from across the province in 10 workshops and 30 small group sessions. The result is a bank of 60 freely available virtual patient cases covering topics in medicine, nursing, midwifery and interprofessional practice, each with a distinct Canadian flavour. Results: Although PINE can be considered successful in terms of the content generated, the real success is the development and transformation of healthcare education practice in the participant institutions involved. Three notable changes arising from PINE are enabling the redesign of the third year of a multisite Ontario-wide midwifery program, the redevelopment of the NOSM IPE program and the augmentation of the NOSM undergraduate medical program to make use of virtual patients in a variety of contexts. Conclusion and Discussion: PINE was able to effect change by providing a focus and a resource for faculty development and experiment outside existing programs and curricula.

%X Background: Virtual reality simulators allow trainees to practice techniques without consequences, reduce potential risk associated with training, minimize animal use, and help to develop standards and optimize procedures. Current intravenous (IV) catheter placement training methods utilize plastic arms, however, the lack of variability can diminish the educational stimulus for the student. This study compares the effectiveness of an interactive, multimedia, virtual reality computer IV catheter simulator with a traditional laboratory experience of teaching IV venipuncture skills to both nursing and medical students. Methods: A randomized, pretest-posttest experimental design was employed. A total of 163 participants, 70 baccalaureate nursing students and 93 third-year medical students beginning their fundamental skills training were recruited. The students ranged in age from 20 to 55 years (mean 25). Fifty-eight percent were female and 68% percent perceived themselves as having average computer skills (25% declaring excellence). The methods of IV catheter education compared included a traditional method of instruction involving a scripted self-study module which involved a 10-minute videotape, instructor demonstration, and hands-on-experience using plastic mannequin arms. The second method involved an interactive multimedia, commercially made computer catheter simulator program utilizing virtual reality (CathSim). Results: The pretest scores were similar between the computer and the traditional laboratory group. There was a significant improvement in cognitive gains, student satisfaction, and documentation of the procedure with the traditional laboratory group compared with the computer catheter simulator group. Both groups were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly. Conclusions: This evaluation and assessment was an initial effort to assess new teaching methodologies related to intravenous catheter placement and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors. Technology alone is not a solution for stand alone IV catheter placement education. A traditional learning method was preferred by students. The combination of these two methods of education may further enhance the trainee's satisfaction and skill acquisition level. © 2003 Excerpta Medica, Inc. All rights reserved.

%X Background: Over the last 25 years, the transfusion medicine community has focused its efforts on preventing the transmission of infectious diseases. We have done an outstanding job in greatly reducing this risk. We are now beginning to shift more of our focus to the safety of bedside blood administration. We must implement measures to assure that the right patient is safely transfused with the right blood product every time. Study: Our hospital purchased a high fi delity human simulator which simulates authentic patient situations. The mannequin can produce computer generated physiologic responses (heart sounds, breath sounds, cardiac rhythms, etc) and has a computerized voice. The mannequin is housed in a private training room. He uses “mocked up” blood made from distilled water mixed with red food coloring. Our education department worked in conjunction with our transfusion services manager and several nurse educators to develop a blood administration simulation excercise for new nursing graduates. The learner objectives for the excercise are as follows: 1) Demonstrate nursing procedures for blood product transfusion from physician order to completion of transfusion. 2) Recognize the most common opportunities for error during the transfusion process. 3) Refl ect on ways that complacency can creep into routine procedures. The participants walk through the entire process, including checking orders in the electronic medical record, drawing the patient's sample for blood bank testing, walking to the blood bank to pick up the blood, administering the blood, and completing post-transfusion procedures. Conclusion: We have completed this excercise with several groups of new nursing graduates. The responses have been very positive. The new nurses reveal that they receive very little to no “hands on” experience with blood administration while in nursing school. They very much appreciate the chance to walk through the entire process, and they convey that their confidence level with this procedure is greatly enhanced after completing the simulation. We will continue to utilize this excercise with new nursing graduates. In addition, next year we will take this to the next level and will develop a modified version of this excercise for nursing skills fairs. Experienced nurses have expressed a desire for a hands on annual refresher in blood administration. We currently use e-Learning modules to accomplish annual nursing in-service education for this procedure.

%X Nurses must be prepared to care for patients following a disaster, including patients exposed to hazardous contaminants. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of virtual reality simulation (VRS) to teach the disaster-specific skill of decontamination. A quasi-experimental design was used to assign nursing students from 2 baccalaureate nursing programs to 1 of 2 groups to learn the disaster skill of decontamination-printed written directions or VRS. Performance, knowledge, and self-efficacy were outcome measures. Although students in the treatment group had significantly lower performance scores than the control group (p = 0.004), students taking part in VRS completed the skill in a significantly shorter amount of time (p = 0.008). No significant group differences were found for self-efficacy (p = 0.172) or knowledge (p = 0.631). However, students in the VRS treatment group reported high levels of satisfaction with VRS as a training method. The disaster-specific skill of decontamination is a low-volume, high-risk skill that must be performed with accuracy to protect both exposed patients and providers performing decontamination. As frontline providers for casualties following a disaster event, emergency nurses must be prepared to perform this skill when needed. Preparation requires cost-effective, timely, and evidence-based educational opportunities that promote positive outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine the benefits and long-term effects of VRS for disaster education.

%X The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of virtual reality simulation (VRS) on learning outcomes and retention of disaster training. The study used a longitudinal experimental design using two groups and repeated measures. A convenience sample of associate degree nursing students enrolled in a disaster course was randomized into two groups; both groups completed web-based modules; the treatment group also completed a virtually simulated disaster experience. Learning was measured using a 20-question multiple-choice knowledge assessment pre/post and at 2 months following training. Results were analyzed using the generalized linear model. Independent and paired t tests were used to examine the between- and within-participant differences. The main effect of the virtual simulation was strongly significant (p&.0001). The VRS effect demonstrated stability over time. In this preliminary examination, VRS is an instructional method that reinforces learning and improves learning retention. © The Author(s) 2012.

%X Purpose: This paper presents a novel approach of computer-assisted learning for nursing education in university undergraduate courses. Background: The most innovative aspect of the proposal is the design of nursing assignments as on-line competitions. The effects of competitive e-learning versus conventional teaching methods on the acquisition and retention of knowledge were compared in a course on medical-surgical nursing. Method: A total of 116 students of mixed gender, age, computer experience and educational background in a second-year course on medical-surgical nursing participated in the study. Data were collected from nursing students at four time points. The on-line activities were carried out using a web-based automatic evaluation system. Results: The study revealed that the competitive e-learning method produced significant cognitive gains for the experimental group students in the immediate follow-up test. Nevertheless, both teaching methods resulted in similar knowledge retention in the 10-week follow-up test. Conclusion: Significant benefits were found following our approach. The work of the students could be evaluated along the course, the workload of instructors was reduced and students received immediate feedback by the on-line judge, which promoted both independent learning and reflective thinking. The approach is applicable to any other nursing educational institution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Educating physicians and other health care professionals about the identification and treatment of patients who drink more than recommended limits is an ongoing challenge. Methods: An educational randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the ability of a standalone training simulation to improve the clinical skills of health care professionals in alcohol screening and intervention. The "virtual reality simulation" combined video, voice recognition, and nonbranching logic to create an interactive environment that allowed trainees to encounter complex social cues and realistic interpersonal exchanges. The simulation included 707 questions and statements and 1207 simulated patient responses. Results: A sample of 102 health care professionals (10 physicians; 30 physician assistants or nurse practitioners; 36 medical students; 26 pharmacy, physican assistant, or nurse practitioner students) were randomly assigned to a no training group (n = 51) or a computer-based virtual reality intervention (n = 51). Professionals in both groups had similar pretest standardized patient alcohol screening skill scores: 53.2 (experimental) vs 54.4 (controls), 52.2 vs 53.7 alcohol brief intervention skills, and 42.9 vs 43.5 alcohol referral skills. After repeated practice with the simulation there were significant increases in the scores of the experimental group at 6 months after randomization compared with the control group for the screening (67.7 vs 58.1; P < .001) and brief intervention (58.3 vs 51.6; P < .04) scenarios. Conclusions: The technology tested in this trial is the first virtual reality simulation to demonstrate an increase in the alcohol screening and brief intervention skills of health care professionals.

%X In different nursing programmes, one important learning outcome is clinical reasoning (CR) skills. However, to date, there is limited number of methods available for assessment of CR skills; especially for distance-based courses. This study investigates students' opinions about the feasibility of using Virtual Patients (VPs) for assessing CR in nursing education. VPs were introduced as an assessment tool in three different nursing courses at two universities, comprising 77 students in total. Students' overall acceptance of this assessment tool, including its applicability to the practise of nursing and the potential of VP-based assessment as a learning experience, were investigated using questionnaires. Course directors used the Web-SP system to assess students' interactions with VPs and their answers regarding diagnoses, caring procedures and their justifications. Students' found the VP cases to be realistic and engaging, and indicate a high level of acceptance for this assessment method. In addition, the students' indicated that VPs were good for practising their clinical skills, although some would prefer that the VP system be less "medical" and asked for more focus on nursing. Although most students supplied correct diagnoses and made adequate clinical decisions, there was a wide range in their ability to explain their clinical reasoning processes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X In health-care education, it is important to assess the competencies that are essential for the professional role. To develop clinical reasoning skills is crucial for nursing practice and therefore an important learning outcome in nursing education programmes. Virtual patients (VPs) are interactive computer simulations of real-life clinical scenarios and have been suggested for use not only for learning, but also for assessment of clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to investigate how experienced paediatric nurses reason regarding complex VP cases and how they make clinical decisions. The study was also aimed to give information about possible issues that should be assessed in clinical reasoning exams for post-graduate students in diploma specialist paediatric nursing education. The information from this study is believed to be of high value when developing scoring and grading models for a VP-based examination for the specialist diploma in paediatric nursing education. Using the think-aloud method, data were collected from 30 RNs working in Swedish paediatric departments, and child or school health-care centres. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The results indicate that experienced nurses try to consolidate their hypotheses by seeing a pattern and judging the value of signs, symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory tests and radiology. They show high specific competence but earlier experience of similar cases was also of importance for the decision making. The nurses thought it was an innovative assessment focusing on clinical reasoning and clinical decision making. They thought it was an enjoyable way to be assessed and that all three main issues could be assessed using VPs. In conclusion, VPs seem to be a possible model for assessing the clinical reasoning process and clinical decision making, but how to score and grade such exams needs further research.

%X For Virtual Patient-based exams, several scoring and grading methods have been proposed, but none have yet been validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new scoring and grading model for VP-based exams in postgraduate paediatric nurse education. The same student group of 19 students performed a VP-based exam in three consecutive courses. When using the scoring and grading assessment model, which contains a deduction system for unnecessary or unwanted actions, a progression was found in the three courses: 53% of the students passed the first exam, 63% the second and 84% passed the final exam. The most common reason for deduction of points was due to students asking too many interview questions or ordering too many laboratory tests. The results showed that the new scoring model made it possible to judge the students' clinical reasoning process as well as their progress.

%X Background and aims Pain management is often inadequate in emergency departments (ED) despite the availability of effective analgesics. Interventions to change professional behavior may therefore help to improve the management of pain within the ED. We hypothesized that a 2-h educational intervention combining e-learning and simulation would result in improved pain treatment of ED patients with pain. Methods Data were collected at the ED of Horsens Regional Hospital during a 3-week study period in March 2015. Pain intensity (NRS, 0–10) and analgesic administration were recorded 24 h a day for all patients who were admitted to the ED during the first and third study weeks. Fifty-three ED nurses and 14 ED residents participated in the educational intervention, which took place in the second study week. Results In total, 247 of 796 patients had pain >3 on the NRS at the admission to the ED and were included in the data analysis. The theoretical knowledge of pain management among nurses and residents increased as assessed by a multiple choice test performed before and after the educational intervention (P = 0.001), but no change in clinical practice could be observed: The administration for analgesics [OR: 1.79 (0.97–3.33)] and for opioids [2.02 (0.79–5.18)] were similar before and after the educational intervention, as was the rate of clinically meaningful pain reduction (NRS >2) during the ED stay [OR: 0.81 (CI 0.45–1.44)]. Conclusions Conduction of a 2-h educational intervention combining interactive case-based e-learning with simulation-based training in an ED setting was feasible with a high participation rate of nurses and residents. Their knowledge of pain management increased after completion of the program, but transfer of the new knowledge into clinical practice could not be found. Future research should explore the effects of repeated education of healthcare providers on pain management. Implications It is essential for nurses and residents in emergency departments to have the basic theoretical and practical skills to treat acute pain properly. A modern approach including e-learning and simulation lead to increased knowledge of acute pain management. Further studies are needed to show how this increased knowledge is transferred into clinical practice.

%X Introduction Simulation has been increasingly utilised in medical education since the publication of Safer Medical Practice.1 Some specialities have led the way in integrating simulation training into curricula to cover technical and higher-level nontechnical skills training. To date simulation in gastroenterology has largely restricted itself to the use of virtual reality endoscopy training. Even then, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate how best to integrate this into the curriculum, so this remains untackled.2 In 2015 UCLPartners funded a Gastroenterology Simulation Fellow, based at The Homerton Hospital, to consider how best to use simulation to deliver multi-professional training across UCLP Trusts. Among the aims has been optimising trainee preparation for learning endoscopy; improving interprofessional training; addressing a need for higher-level skills training; creating sustainability in delivering training; and engaging trainees in reflective practice that is little utilised as a tool elsewhere in training. Methods Over the course of a year we are delivering 15 oneday courses from 4 UCLParters trusts. They include courses in Screen-based Endoscopy Technical Skills, Human-Factors in Virtual Endoscopy and Situational Training in Gastroenterology. The courses are open to both gastroenterology and endoscopy nurses and gastroenterology and surgical registrars, matching different courses to different training grades. We are evaluating the courses by means of written feedback using both Likert Scales and freetext. We will analyse both quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate how well received the courses were; how well they addressed specific demands of the curriculum and revalidation requirements; and whether they successfully addressed elements of the curriculum not met elsewhere. We are also undertaking faculty feedback to ascertain explore the perception of increasing simulation training in gastroenterology and identify any barriers to the ongoing delivery of training. Results Early results from the first courses seem to indicate that they were well received with high levels of enjoyment and engagement, and that there may be significant gaps in the training programme which may best be met by simulation. By early June we will have undertaken collation of all data from course feedback, and analysis as above. Conclusion The results will inform the integration of simulation into the training program and local curriculum over the coming years and how to create sustainability to achieve this.

%X This study aimed to develop and assess an application software for the teaching of the procedure Manual Measurement of the Central Venous Pressure which can be used in mobile devices. The research was conducted in three phases (Survey of needs; Methodology for multimedia application development and evaluation of the multimedia application).The multimedia was the method chosen because it favors an encouraging and dynamic environment, as it integrates images and texts into an application software available for cell phones, constituting a mobile and autonomous means for learning. The research allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of the development from this pedagogical tool and open up prospects for believing that, in Nursing education, the technology available can uncover new ways of learning in a meaningful manner.

%X AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using crisis resource management (CRM) principles and high-fidelity human patient simulation (HFHPS) for interprofessional (IP) team training of students from undergraduate nursing, nurse anesthesia, medical, and respiratory therapy. BACKGROUND: IP education using simulation-based training has the potential to transform education by improving teamwork and communication and breaking down silos in education. METHOD: This one-year study used a quasi-experimental design to evaluate students' acquisition and retention of teamwork and communication skills. A convenience sample consisted of 52 students in the fall semester, with 40 students returning in the spring. RESULTS: Mean scores increased after training, and skills were retained fairly well. Any loss was regained with repeat training in the spring. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that using CRM and HFHPS is an effective pedagogy for teaching communication and teamwork skills to IP student teams.

%X Background Nurses are vital in the care and treatment of children/adults with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies (SID). For patients on long-lasting/life-long treatments, such as e g IgG replacement therapy, the nurses are often the ones who support self-care of the patients/families, take the practical decisions about the IgG therapy and the necessary equipment, and take responsibility for therapy follow-ups. The PID/SID University Education Project The education will be at advanced level, evidence-based and comprise 7.5 credit points (nursing science 4.5 medical science 3.0 points). A web based teaching and learning platform will be used, thus making it possible for nurses living/working far away from the University to participate. The medical education will cover e g pathophysiology including genetics, symptoms and diagnostic procedures, microbiology and treatment of infections; nursing education will cover e g research-based knowledge about immunodeficiency treatments, motivational dialogue techniques, patient-/family-education including compliance, and quality of life. The education will be held for the first time during spring semester 2015. Future education and graduation This is a unique University education for nurses in Swedish/ Scandinavian speaking countries. Still, the education should be considered a first stepping-stone in creating a formal graduation as an Immunology/PID Nurse. The opportunity for further courses deepening the knowledge in different areas will hopefully be possible within the European Union Higher Educational System, and possibly globally, involving INGID as the coordinating organisation.

%X BACKGROUND: Little has been written about using human patient simulation to teach primary care management to large groups of nurse practitioner (NP) students. This article describes an innovative design for simulated clinical experiences based on a game show format.
METHOD: This large-group design was conceived as a way to overcome several challenges, particularly limited faculty resources, to integrating simulation into NP education. Progressive variations evolved from this foundation, including the use of observer-participant groups; initial and follow-up visits on the same simulated patient; and mentor-mentee collaborations.
RESULTS: Student comments, while consistently positive about the simulated clinical experiences, have been used to guide revisions to strengthen the simulation program.
CONCLUSION: The innovative large-group design enabled faculty to use simulation to enhance students' skills in primary care management. Faculties with similar challenges might find these strategies useful to replicate or adapt.

%X This article explores a case of the implementation of high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in an undergraduate preregistration nursing program in a Canadian school of nursing. A small practice collaborative project to develop reusable simulation resources for team-based simulations is described, using HFS technology. Considerations for effective learning resulting from faculty and student evaluations of the project are discussed. Students identified positive learning experiences and indicated that real-time patient status changes proved valuable to them. Also, using these techniques offered a safe environment for improving competence. The use of reflective debriefing appeared to be a focal area for learning that requires emphasis in the planning of HFS experiences. This template, team-focused learning approach also appeared to offer a cost-efficient strategy for HFS.

%X This article presents the design and evaluation of an interprofessional multiple-patient simulation between nursing and graduate dietetic students. Dietetic students' completed surveys were observed, scored, and debriefed during 3 patient simulations, and submitted plans of care. Fifteen of the 16 students agreed that the simulation enhanced interprofessional communication skills. Plans of care improved after debriefings, and 37 of the 39 nursing students who completed the simulation with dietetic students said the experience helped them learn the dietitian's role. Interprofessional simulations provide a practice opportunity for students to deliver clinical care in a safe setting. Debriefing is formative in improving nutrition care process skill.

The difficulty has been in finding ways to facilitate the process.This article describes an innovative web-based virtual community. The Neighborhood, used to promote conceptual learning across a new curriculum at the University of New Mexico College of Nursing. The Neighborhood features 30 fictional characters that represent various cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and demonstrate a range of health and psychosocial problems. These characters interact with various community agencies in numerous health care settings. The Neighborhood has strong links to three well-founded teaching strategies: storytelling, case-based learning, and interpretive pedagogy. Because the cases unfold over time, in much the same way problems develop in real life, ongoing exposure to a concept is permitted, facilitating deep understanding.

%X Nurse educators are challenged to keep up with highly specialised clinical practice, emerging research evidence, regulation requirements and rapidly changing information technology while teaching very large numbers of diverse students in a resource constrained environment. This complex setting provides the context for the CaseWorld project, which aims to simulate those aspects of clinical practice that can be represented by e-learning. This paper describes the development, implementation and evaluation of CaseWorld, a simulated learning environment that supports case based learning. CaseWorld provides nursing students with the opportunity to view unfolding authentic cases presented in a rich multimedia context. The first round of comprehensive summative evaluation of CaseWorld is discussed in the context of earlier formative evaluation, reference group input and strategies for integration of CaseWorld with subject content. This discussion highlights the unique approach taken in this project that involved simultaneous prototype development and large scale implementation, thereby necessitating strong emphasis on staff development, uptake and engagement. The lessons learned provide an interesting basis for further discussion of broad content sharing across disciplines and universities, and the contribution that local innovations can make to global education advancement.

%X ISSUE: Hand hygiene (HH) compliance direct observation requires observer training and validation. To improve care and prevention of infections in children with cancer worldwide, HH compliance is essential. Direct HH compliance observation is part of the World Health Organization (WHO) HH multimodal improvement strategy. In a situational analysis, we identified lack of training and validation of HH compliance observers at our international partner sites. PROJECT: We first developed and recorded a 10-week online Spanish course for viewing at our website. Second, we designed a database using the Epi Info TM7 to enter and analyze HHcompliance observation data. Then, we delivered the course using: (1) individualized online training (asynchronous distance learning method), and (2) on-site training by retrieving and Projecting the online course. We trained in HH theory and field practice. The theoretical component had four modules based on the WHO educational materials. The 6-week field practice consisted of 4 weeks of 20-minutes daily observations, and 2-weeks of data entry and analysis. RESULTS: Eighty healthcare workers (HCWs) from 47 healthcare facilities in 8 Latin American countries enrolled in the training course. Forty three participants completed both components. Thirty participants completed the theoretical component only and 7 withdrewfrom the course. Of the 80 HCWs, 84% (67) were nurses, most of them infection preventionists (n=41). Significant knowledge transfer was documented for both delivering Methods (Table1 & 2). Participants carried out 1260 direct HH monitoring sessions and reported more than 18,000 HH opportunities (Table 3). Fortythree participants successfully used the database. In 18 healthcare facilities, direct HH compliance monitoring was conducted for the first time. LESSON LEARNED: E-learning is a promising tool to train and validate direct HH compliance observers in low and middle income countries. An online educational platform, local leadership and ementoring are essential to implement this novel approach in this setting. (Table Presented).

%X The Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI) are innovative approaches to strengthening the academic and clinical training of physicians and nurses in Sub-Saharan African countries, which are heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS. Begun in 2010 by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief with the National Institutes of Health, investments in curricula, innovative learning technologies, clinical mentoring, and research opportunities are providing a strong base to advance high-quality education for growing numbers of urgently needed new physicians and nurses in these countries. The MEPI and NEPI focus on strengthening learning institutions is central to the vision for expanding the pool of health professionals to meet the full range of a country's health needs. A robust network of exchange between education institutions and training facilities, both within and across countries, is transforming the quality of medical education and augmenting a platform for research opportunities for faculty and clinicians, which also serves as an incentive to retain professionals in the country. Excellence in patient care and a spirit of professionalism, core to MEPI and NEPI, provide a strong foundation for the planning and delivery of health services in participating countries.

%X Objective: TOXlearning, the UK clinical toxicology e-learning resource developed by NPIS Edinburgh, went live in September 2005 providing training on using TOXBASE® ; additional modules were added in July 2008 (Management of the poisoned patient) and September 2010 (Management of patients involved in chemical incidents). The objective of this work was to identify users'usage patterns, and assess their experience of the resource. Methods: Web usage statistics were analysed. All users since 2005 were e-mailed a quality assurance questionnaire and returns analysed. Results: At 30/09/11 3270 individuals had registered since the site's launch; 2905 completing modules on the first unit, 690 the second, 161 the third. Users have training-level access to TOXBASE®, the UK clinical toxicology database. The top TOXBASE® monographs accessed closely matched the main substances covered in the first module (e.g. antifreeze/ ethylene glycol, paracetamol, ferrous sulphate, etc). As newer modules came online covering different topics, hits on corresponding monographs rose up the ranks (e.g. from the second module digoxin rose from 77th to 18th; from the third module sulphur mustard and carbon monoxide ranked for the first time). Only 2425 users'e-mail addresses remained valid; 59.4% (1439) “official” addresses/40.6% (986) private accounts. Responders were ambulance staff 28.1% (37), nurses 21.2% (28), doctors 18.1% (24), NHS 24/Direct 16.6% (22), and other 15.9% (21). All user types responded similarly and positively when asked to grade statements concerning ease of access, attractiveness of resource and ease of navigation. On a scale of 1 - 6 (1 = disagree completely/6 = agree completely) they agreed “a lot” or “completely” that learning was pitched at the right level (75.0% [99]), and that the subject matter was interesting (88.6% [117]). On a scale of 1- 5 (1 = very poor/5 = very good) 93.3% (124) rated their overall satisfaction 4 or 5. Conclusion: As potentially 7 years could have passed since first registration the response rate (5.6% [135]) was, as expected, low. A large proportion of users registered using private e-mail accounts to facilitate learning from home. Users took the opportunity to use training-level access to TOXBASE® to support their e-learning activities. Irrespective of user type respondents indicated a high degree of confidence and satisfaction with the resource.

%X Nurse educators claim accountability to ensure their students are prepared to assume leadership responsibilities upon graduation. Although front-line nurse leaders and nurse executives feel new graduates are not adequately prepared to take on basic leadership roles, professional nursing organizations such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) deem leadership skills are core competencies of new graduate nurses. This study includes comparison of a leadership-focused multi-patient simulation and the traditional leadership clinical experiences in a baccalaureate nursing leadership course. The results of this research show both environments contribute to student learning. There was no statistical difference in the overall score. Students perceived a statistically significant difference in communication with patients in the traditional inpatient environment. However, the students perceived a statistical significant difference in teaching-learning dyad toward simulation.

%X Health-care professionals need an appropriate genetics knowledge base to care for patients and their families. However, studies have indicated that nurses and midwives lack the requisite genetics knowledge to practice effectively and safely, with a paucity of resources to address their educational needs. This paper describes an action research study aimed at developing an online genetics resource for students and practitioners in a range of health professions. A literature review of current health-care genetics education was undertaken. In the first phase of the action cycle, a sample of nurses and midwives were surveyed using a questionnaire to discover their perceived learning needs and the acceptability of an e-learning approach. Using the findings, an online resource for health professionals was developed, by means of a life stage structure to expedite accessibility. The developmental process leading to the construction of clinical case studies in this resource (including theory, ethical, and practical issues) and the evaluation strategy are discussed. © 2007 The Authors; Journal Compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

%X The inadequate use of syringe pumps can jeopardize patient safety, and syringe pump trainings are conducted to manage this risk. A critical step in this risk management process is the learning success of trainees. In the present paper, we compared an e-learning approach with standard classroom training in learning success effectives, trainees' opinion on the trainings, and investigated the relation between technological affinity and learning success. The results showed that e-learning was as effective as classroom training but nursing students' confidence in using the pump and satisfaction with the training was decreased for e-learning compared with classroom training. We discuss the results in context of the nursing e-learning literature. Finally, we discuss the literature for risk identification, risk analysis, risk treatment, and risk monitoring and control in the context of syringe pump training and add the lessons learned from the evaluated e-learning program.

%X Background Errors occur frequently during the medication process, from prescription to administration. They can lead to severe damage for patient health, particularly with injectable (IV) drugs. Purpose To evaluate the impact of a self-made e-learning lesson, focused on the safety of IV drug preparation and administration, on the ability of nurses and pharmacy students to detect errors voluntarily placed in a simulated patient's room ('room of errors'). Material and methods • Selection of 11 errors related to IV drug preparation and administration based on reported incidents. Study design: number of errors detected in 15 min in the 'room of errors' by nurses and pharmacy students before and after an e-learning lesson (30 min). • Evaluation of the impact of the e-learning on the mean number and type of detected errors (±SD), globally and in both populations. • Satisfaction evaluation (standardised questionnaire). Results • 28 participants (16 nurses/12 pharmacy students) were enrolled. The mean number of detected errors increased significantly after completion of the e-learning (4.6 ± 2.3 vs 2.6 ± 1.8; p < 0.0001). The e-learning had a greater impact on the detection of administration errors compared with preparation errors (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 5.5); p = 0.001). • Nurses: after e-learning, the mean number of detected errors increased (5.5 ± 2.5 vs 3.3 ± 2.0; p < 0.0001). The probability of detecting a preparation error (that was not detected before e-learning) was lower (21.6%; 95% CI 12.1 to 35.8) compared with administration errors (34.7%; 95% CI 20.5 to 52.4). • Pharmacy students: after e-learning, the mean number of detected errors increased (3.3 ± 1.1 vs 1.8 ± 1.1; p = 0.0001). The probability of detecting a preparation error (that was not detected before e-learning) was very low (3.8%; 95% CI 1.0 to 14.1) but higher for administration errors (27.3%; 95% CI 17.2 to 40.4). • Satisfaction evaluation: most of the participants (100% of nurses, 83% of pharmacy students) appreciated this concept of learning but it was judged more suitable for nurses' practice. Conclusion The e-learning lesson significantly improved the number of detected errors, particularly of administration errors. Long term impact and usefulness of this innovative pedagogic approach for continuing education should be evaluated in the future.

%X Faced with increasingly complex clinical situations, nurses must respond with accurate clinical judgment. But del Bueno (2005) reports that only 35 percent of new graduate nurses exhibit entry-level expectations of the necessary critical-thinking skills. Croskerry (2003) argues that clinicians' education should be directed at developing cognitive strategies that reduce errors in clinical decision-making. A challenge for nurse educators is finding activities to help students analyze their thinking as they address clinical problems. The author describes an assignment, given to third-year baccalaureate students, that used both online learning and high-fidelity patient simulation. Through discussions with instructors and peers, as well as personal reflection, students gained insight into both their sound and faulty critical thinking and clinical decisions.

%X Simulation techniques such as virtual patients (VPs) are valuable tools for teaching and learning a range of clinical proficiencies. Compared with other forms of simulation, however, the reported use of VPs within nursing is limited. Descriptions of simple, low cost methods for the development of VP devices could help facilitate their wider implementation and use in nursing education and training. In order to encourage broader use of VP technologies within nursing, this paper aims to expand current knowledge of VP creation by reference to the development of two virtual mental health patients produced for a multilingual e-learning course for European mental health nurses. Focusing on narrative VPs, the paper provides a brief overview of various types and potential uses of VP techniques, along with central elements of good practice in VP development. The five phase development framework used in the creation of the two VPs is presented. Processes detailed include the design and construction of case scenarios and multimedia components, in addition to initial usability and validity testing. VPs like those described here are a relatively inexpensive way of integrating virtual simulation technology into nursing education, particularly within online, blended and/or cross-cultural learning environments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X This paper discusses the use of simulation in nursing education and training, including potential benefits and barriers associated with its use. In particular, it addresses the hitherto scant application of diverse simulation devices and dedicated simulation scenarios in psychiatric and mental health nursing. It goes on to describe a low-cost, narrative-based virtual patient simulation technique which has the potential for wide application within health and social care education. An example of the implementation of this technology in a web-based pilot course for acute mental health nurses is given. This particular virtual patient technique is a simulation type ideally suited to promoting essential mental health nursing skills such as critical thinking, communication and decision making. Furthermore, it is argued that it is particularly amenable to e-learning and blended learning environments, as well as being an apt tool where multilingual simulations are required. The continued development, implementation and evaluation of narrative virtual patient simulations across a variety of health and social care programmes would help ascertain their success as an educational tool. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing.

Methods: Realized from November 30, 2015 to June 6, 2016. It was designed a management system learning installed on a web server that is used to manage, distribute and control the activities of training. The purpose is to train physician, nurses and students in to take cervical smear tests. To design the software PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) was used. MySQL (My Structured Query Language) was used to structure the database. Software access was through awebsitewhere different menus. Participants and teachers log on the website with a user name and password. Results: Software testing was conducted during a training course of 56 hours to health personnel. All participants took Pap smears and software tools used to enhance learning. The information was stored in a database for statistical processing. Electronic records were legible, accurate and complete, which reduces human error. The software allows applying the methodology b learning for training, a more meaningful learning was identified. It was developed in the participant: interest, self-knowledge and responsibility. This software can be used both in medical and nursing students and health professionals in service. Conclusions: The educational software was very useful in the teachinglearning process. It was increasing appropriate and useful samples for the interpretation of the pathologist; also the participants had a friendly, fast and accessible electronic platform.

The union of these methods, both of which use a hands-on approach, complements the use of text and laboratory demonstration for teaching infusion therapy. This study shows that with increased use of the virtual reality system, the student has increased probability of success at the first attempt during the return demonstration of the skill of initiating infusion therapy. With the emphasis on enhancing student preparedness for this advanced skill, the authors have found that the inclusion of all methods will better meet students' learning needs and their preferred methods of learning.

%X INTRODUCTION: Human patient simulation has been widely adopted in healthcare education despite little research supporting its efficacy. The debriefing process is central to simulation education, yet alternative evaluation methods to support providing optimal feedback to students have not been well explored. Eye tracking technology is an innovative method for providing objective evaluative feedback to students after a simulation experience. The purpose of this study was to compare 3 forms of simulation-based student feedback (verbal debrief only, eye tracking only, and combined verbal debrief and eye tracking) to determine the most effective method for improving student knowledge and performance.
METHODS: An experimental study using a pretest-posttest design was used to compare the effectiveness of 3 types of feedback. The subjects were senior baccalaureate nursing students in their final semester enrolled at a large university in the northeast United States. Students were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 intervention groups.
RESULTS: All groups performed better in the posttest evaluation than in the pretest. Certain safety practices improved significantly in the eye tracking-only group. These criteria were those that required an auditory and visual comparison of 2 artifacts such as "Compares patient stated name with name on ID band."
CONCLUSIONS: Eye tracking offers a unique opportunity to provide students with objective data about their behaviors during simulation experiences, particularly related to safety practices that involve the comparison of patient stated data to an artifact such as an ID band. Despite the limitations of current eye tracking technology, there is significant potential for the use of this technology as a method for the study and evaluation of patient safety practices.

%X The authors conducted a randomised controlled trial of four pedagogical methods commonly used to deliver teamwork training and measured the effects of each method on the acquisition of student teamwork knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The authors recruited 203 senior nursing students and 235 fourth-year medical students (total N = 438) from two major universities for a 1-day interdisciplinary teamwork training course. All participants received a didactic lecture and then were randomly assigned to one of four educational methods didactic (control), audience response didactic, role play and human patient simulation. Student performance was assessed for teamwork attitudes, knowledge and skills using: (a) a 36-item teamwork attitudes instrument (CHIRP), (b) a 12-item teamwork knowledge test, (c) a 10-item standardised patient (SP) evaluation of student teamwork skills performance and (d) a 20-item modification of items from the Mayo High Performance Teamwork Scale (MHPTS). All four cohorts demonstrated an improvement in attitudes (F(1,370) = 48.7, p = 0.001) and knowledge (F(1,353) = 87.3, p = 0.001) pre- to post-test. No educational modality appeared superior for attitude (F(3,370) = 0.325, p = 0.808) or knowledge (F(3,353) = 0.382, p = 0.766) acquisition. No modality demonstrated a significant change in teamwork skills (F(3,18) = 2.12, p = 0.134). Each of the four modalities demonstrated significantly improved teamwork knowledge and attitudes, but no modality was demonstrated to be superior. Institutions should feel free to utilise educational modalities, which are best supported by their resources to deliver interdisciplinary teamwork training.

%X Background: Inter-professional teamwork skills for geriatric care are integral to education of health professional students. Logistical challenges hinder longitudinal in-person small-group experiences so we created an interactive web-based system to foster and measure collaboration around care of virtual patients. Methods: Designed by faculty from the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Social Work, the case system annually engages more than 600 senior students from these schools in teams of 7 to 9 that collaborate for 6 weeks. In each of 4 chapters of a complex unfolding geriatric case, every student receives discipline-specific patient information. Students share data using an electronic chart within the system and answer questions individually based on charted information. Then, each team collaboratively answers the same questions, building competency in geriatrics and teamwork. Each choice for each of 60 questions may be selected, forcing approximately 529 decisions, all linked to core competencies. Possible scores range from -9580 to +9280 (range 18,860). A message board supports asynchronous dialogue. Closing each chapter, students conduct peer evaluations of each other. Extensive automated data capture quantifies degree of engagement, knowledge and decision-making. Results: Team scores from the first 295 users on 40 teams (8-27- 12 through 11-16-12) varied from +2850 to +6530. Individuals' average score by team ranged from 1977 to 4230. Social work students' scores were lower (Median = 1480, p<0.01 for all comparisons) reflecting a “medical” focus of many questions; there were insignificant differences between median scores for students from medicine (3780), nursing (3540), and pharmacy (3220). Strongest univariate predictors of team score were individual scores, logins, and post views by the team. Preliminary regression analyses show that number of team views of the dialogue box is the strongest predictor. Conclusions: A virtual case system provided a setting for asynchronous inter-professional learning. The system discriminated between individual performance, and team performance, showing that collaborative behaviors as represented by logins and posts viewed, correlated more strongly with better team performance than did individual performance. This virtual case system represents a novel, effective way to teach and assess geriatric knowledge and inter-professional teamwork.

%X Background: We developed a virtual case system to train and evaluate interprofessional teams on management of geriatric patients. Content was based on the AAMC's 26 medical student geriatric competencies and 8 domains. Students shared data, then answered questions both individually and collaboratively as a team. We analyzed individual performance by students to identify curricular deficits in geriatric concepts. Methods: Over a 12-week period in 2014, 50 interprofessional teams of senior students from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and social work (total n = 295) followed a virtual patient through a sequence of 4 health episodes. Students entered case data into a virtual health record, then individually answered questions about patient care and treatment. Items used a multiple response format; students could select a number of different choices under each stem, some right and some wrong. We calculated overall percent correct including both correct and incorrect responses selected. Each question was mapped to as many as 3 AAMC geriatric competencies for medical students. Scores by question were averaged by competency domain and compared using ANOVA. Results: Mean number of questions mapped to each domain was 10.4 ranging from 3 (Falls, Balance, Gait) to 17 (Self-care Capacity) Medical student scores for each domain varied individually and ranged from a mean of 73% (SD 13%) correct (Medication Management and Atypical Presentation of Disease) to 85% (Falls, Balance, Gait, SD 13%). ANOVA tests show that the mean score for Falls, Balance, Gait was significantly higher than the average score for all other domains, while scores for Medication Management and Atypical Presentation of Disease were significantly lower than other domains (p = .03). Comparison across professions showed significantly higher scores (p < .01) in certain domains: Medication Management (pharmacy highest; social work lowest), Atypical Presentation of Disease (medicine highest; social work lowest), and Palliative Care (social work highest; pharmacy lowest). No significant differences were observed in the domains of Hospital Care for Elders and Health Care Planning and Promotion. Conclusions: Based on results of the virtual case, we identified strengths and weakness of our geriatrics curriculum across health professions and have the potential to inform and monitor the impact of future curricular interventions.

%X This paper describes the conceptual design and testing of an Interactive Computerised Decision Support Framework (ICDSF) which was constructed to enable student nurses to "think like a nurse." The ICDSF was based on a model of clinical reasoning. Teaching student nurses to reason clinically is important as poor clinical reasoning skills can lead to "failure-to rescue" of deteriorating patients. The framework of the ICDSF was based on nursing concepts to encourage deep learning and transferability of knowledge. The principles of active student participation, situated cognition to solve problems, authenticity, and cognitive rehearsal were used to develop the ICDSF. The ICDSF was designed in such a way that students moved through it in a step-wise fashion and were required to achieve competency at each step before proceeding to the next. The quality of the ICDSF was evaluated using a questionairre survey, students' written comments and student assessment measures on a pilot and the ICDSF. Overall students were highly satisfied with the clinical scenarios of the ICDSF and believed they were an interesting and useful way to engage in authentic clinical learning. They also believed the ICDSF was useful in developing cognitive skills such as clinical reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making. Some reported issues were the need for good technical support and the lack of face to face contact when using e-learning. Some students also believed the ICDSF was less useful than actual clinical placements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Background: Human patient simulation (HPS) has been used since 1969 for teaching purposes. Only recently has technology advanced to allow application to the complex field of trauma resuscitation. The purpose of our study was to validate an advanced HPS as an evaluation tool of trauma team resuscitation skills. Methods: The pilot study evaluated 10 three-person military resuscitation teams from community hospitals that participated in a 28-day rotation at a civilian trauma center. Each team consisted of physicians, nurses, and medics. Using the HPS, teams were evaluated on arrival and again on completion of the rotation. In addition, the 10 trauma teams were compared with 5 expert teams composed of experienced trauma surgeons and nurses. Two standardized trauma scenarios were used, representing a severely injured patient with multiple injuries and with an Injury Severity Score of 41 (probability of survival, 50%). Performance was measured using a unique human performance assessment tool that included five scored and eight timed tasks generally accepted as critical to the initial assessment and treatment of a trauma patient. Scored tasks included airway, breathing, circulation, and disability assessments as well as overall organizational skills and a total score. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare the military teams' scores for scenarios 1 and 2, and the comparison of the military teams' final scores with the expert teams. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The 10 military teams demonstrated significant improvement in four of the five scored (p ≤ 0.05) and six of the eight timed (p ≤ 0.05) tasks during the final scenario. This improvement reflects the teams' cumulative didactic and clinical experience during the 28-day trauma refresher course as well as some degree of simulator familiarization. Improved final scores reflected efficient and coordinated team efforts. The military teams' initial scores were worse than the expert group in all categories, but their final scores were only lower than the expert groups in 2 of 13 measurements (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: No studies have validated the use of the HPS as an effective teaching or evaluation tool in the complex field of trauma resuscitation. These pilot data demonstrate the ability to evaluate trauma team performance in a reproducible fashion. In addition, we were able to document a significant improvement in team performance after a 28-day trauma refresher course, with scores approaching those of the expert teams.

%X Purpose: The purpose of the pilot study was twofold: to (i) develop a new interprofessional educational module to teach and evaluate student practices in a simulated complex healthcare environment and (ii) determine the feasibility of implementing such a complex interprofessional simulation scenario. Relevance: High-fidelity simulation has been shown to be effective in health sciences education for learning new skills and practicing team approaches to managing complex care (Dunn, 2004; Issenberg et al., 2005; Laschinger et al., 2008). Infection control skills are taught early in most educational programs. A new simulation module developed for senior students would provide the opportunity to practice effective infection control skills in a fast-paced, realistic environment while collaborating with other healthcare providers. Participants: Twenty-four senior health professional student volunteers (9 nursing, 7 medicine, 8 physiotherapy) participated in the pilot of the scenario. Three profession-specific instructors ran the scenario (infection control, physiotherapy, nursing) with two expert observers (infection control practitioner (ICP), research assistant). Methods: Faculty from physiotherapy, medicine, and nursing met with ICPs and an information technology simulation expert and developed 3 critical care patient cases using highfidelity simulators. The 2.5 hour pilot of the scenario included (i) a short video review of infection control practices, (ii) a pre-scenario briefing and role assignment, (iii) 25 minute run of the simulation with Team A (n = 12) as clinicians and Team B (n = 12) as observers, (iv) a 2nd run of the scenario switching teams and (v) post-session focus groups (students, instructors), questionnaires (x3) and observer feedback. Analysis: The quantitative data (student questionnaires) were analysed as descriptive statistics (SPSS©). The qualitative (participant observation&focus group) data transcribed concepts organized into themes representative trustworthy quotes extracted (results will be presented elsewhere). Results: Interprofessional Communication and Teamwork (9 questions/6-point Likert scale): In general students from all professions reported being comfortable with IP communication and teamwork. Nursing students reported less confidence putting forward personal opinions in a group. The majority of the students reported feeling uncomfortable taking the leadership role in a group. Confidence with Infection Control Skills (8 questions/6-point Likert scale): Overall, students were confident with hand hygiene, routine practices, contact precautions and removing personal protective equipment but were less confident with enhanced precautions. Satisfaction with the Interprofessional Infection Control Simulation Module (7 questions/6-point Likert scale): The majority of the students enjoyed the session, felt the IP component was valuable and felt that simulation-based training was valuable. The majority of students felt that the IP infection control simulation session should be mandatory, however, 12.5% of PT students disagreed somewhat, 14.3% of medical students disagreed strongly and 28.6% of medical students disagreed. Observer Feedback: Senior students applied infection control principals poorly within a complex patient care scenario. IP collaboration was evident. The rooms were too crowded. Conclusions: 1. It is feasible to develop and implement a complex, simulation-based interprofessional teaching module. 2. Senior healthcare students may need enhanced infection control practice. 3. The module logistics require review and revision. Implications: In educational institutions where the resources exist to implement high-fidelity simulation scenarios, enhanced infection control practices could be a target skill.

%X Objectives: Acquisition of microbiological knowledge is both intellectual- and skills-oriented. The traditional 'wet-lab' is an important platform to achieve this goal. The heightened interest in microbiology and infectious diseases, and the administrative clustering of many institutions, has lead to increased number of students from geographically diversed locations. As a result, it is increasingly difficult to organise laboratory classes with limited resources such as laboratory space and number of teachings staffs. To address the situation, a web-based“Virtual Microbiology Laboratory”was developed and evaluated for its effectiveness. Methods: Starting 2007/2008, a web-based Virtual Microbiology Laboratory was set up for nursing undergraduate microbiology studies. Students' performance and perception of the course were analysed for three consecutive academic years (2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09; class-size ranged from 174 to 190). These web materials comprised of a series of 58 web images, 19 videos, 9 on-line quizzes and an anonymous forum. Access to this web was voluntary, but usage was logged. Students' learning outcomes were assessed by course evaluation questionnaire (23 items on a 6-point Likert scale: 1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree) and examination. The course evaluation was conducted at the end of the course, but prior to the examination. The examination was paper-based with long-answer-questions and a-type MCQ, which were marked by the same panel of teachers. Results: An improved perception on understanding of concepts and interest in microbiology was observed with the launch of Virtual Microbiology Laboratory. An improvement in scoring on the MCQ was also observed (2008/09 vs 2006/07, p < 0.05) However, scoring with long-answer-questions had declined (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The development of Virtual Microbiology Laboratory has stimulated interest among undergraduate students. Their knowledge, however, when assessed by traditional examination method had yielded divergent results. Ability to recall factual information, as tested by a-type MCQ, is enhanced. Ability to assimilate information, and to present them in a logical written manner (as tested by long-answer-question) had declined. While web-based e-learning is a useful shotgun approach to improve the breath of information, it may not replace classroom or bench-side teaching where in-depth discussion are generated, hypothesizing- and theorising-skills are developed and practised.

%X AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the learning effect and resource use cost of workplace-based, blended e-learning about dysphagia for stroke rehabilitation nurses.
BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a potentially life-threatening problem that compromises quality of life. In many countries, nurses play a crucial role in supporting the management of patients with swallowing problems, yet the literature reports a need for training.
DESIGN: A single-group, pre- and post-study with mixed methods.
METHODS: Each blended e-learning session comprised a needs analysis, e-learning programmes, practical skills about modifying fluids and action planning to transfer learning into practice. Participants were the population of registered nurses (n = 22) and healthcare assistants (n = 10) on a stroke rehabilitation ward in a large, teaching hospital in England between August 2010-March 2011. Data collection comprised observation (34 hours), questionnaires administered at four time points to examine change in attitude, knowledge and practice, and estimating the resource use cost for the service. Nonparametric tests and content analysis were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: All participants achieved a nationally recognised level of competence. The learning effect was evident on the post- and follow-up measures, with some items of dysphagia knowledge and attitude achieving significance at the p ≤ 0·05 level. The most common self-reported changes in practice related to medicines management, thickening fluids and oral hygiene. The resource use cost was estimated at £2688 for 108 hours training.
CONCLUSIONS: Workplace-based, blended e-learning was an acceptable, cost effective way of delivering essential clinical knowledge and skills about dysphagia.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Dysphagia should be viewed as a patient safety issue because of the risks of malnutrition, dehydration and aspiration pneumonia. As such, it is pertinent to many members of the interdisciplinary team. Consideration should be given to including dysphagia management in initial education and continuing professional development programmes.

%X This multisite study examined the impact of multiple-patient simulation experiences on the development of nursing students' patient safety competencies in the final semester of their baccalaureate or associate degree nursing program. It extends the Jeffries Simulation Model by investigating how the student factors of tolerance for ambiguity and self-reported grade point average (GPA), in addition to age, relate to the outcomes of simulation. The study showed that students' safety competencies improved significantly from the first to the second simulation. Student age, GPA, and tolerance of ambiguity were not significantly correlated to the students' demonstration of patient safety competencies. The findings of this study contribute to the science of nursing education by providing evidence for nursing educators related to the impact of multiple-patient simulations on improving and documenting students' patient safety competencies before their entry into the workforce. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

%X Delirium is a common, serious and potentially preventable problem. It is argued here that knowledge and skills for effective assessment and treatment of delirium cannot be considered 'specialist'. Rather, delirium is a problem that requires a healthcare team approach to assessing patients, identifying risks or symptoms and reducing precipitating factors. Research from the preceding decade suggests that the clinical reality is falling short of this ideal with the result that many cases of delirium go undetected and many precipitating factors are not reduced where this is indeed possible. This presents a challenge for the education of nursing and medical students and for the development of qualified staff in practice. The current paper outlines an educational approach, e-learning, which increases access for learners, integrates knowledge and skill development and promotes active, problem-based learning. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

The blended learning program was developed by the authors and implemented for 4 weeks. 56 senior nursing students were recruited at a university in Korea. Significant improvement was noted in learning achievement. No significant differences were noted between FTF and web-based learning in learning motivation. Learning satisfaction and students' experience in taking this course revealed some positive effects of blended learning. The use of blended learning program for undergraduate nursing students will provide an effective learning model.

%X Background Knowledge among critical care nurses and their adherence to evidence-based guidelines for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia is reported to be low. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of human patient simulation (HPS) education in the nursing management of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Methods A prospective, parallel, randomized controlled trial with repeated measurements was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Finland from February-October 2012. Thirty critical care nurses were allocated evenly to intervention and control groups (n = 15 each). The effectiveness of HPS education was evaluated through the validated Ventilator Bundle Questionnaire and Ventilator Bundle Observation Schedule at baseline and repeated twice-after the clinical and simulation settings, respectivley. Results After HPS education, the average skill scores (Ventilator Bundle Observation Schedule) in the intervention group increased significantly (46.8%-60.0% of the total score) in the final postintervention observation. In the average skill scores, a linear mixed model identified significant time (Pt <.001) and group (Pg =.03) differences and time-group interactions (Pt*g =.02) between the study groups after the HPS education. In contrast, the model did not identify any significant change over time (Pt =.29) or time-group interactions (Pt =.69) between groups in average knowledge scores (Ventilator Bundle Questionnaire). Conclusions Our study identified significant transfer of learned skills to clinical practice following HPS education but no influence on the level of participants' factual knowledge.

The main points to be described are the integration of PBL and e-learning methods and nursing students' learning outcomes in clinical practice. PBL pedagogy develops information literacy skills, critical thinking and evidence-based nursing skills, communication, co-operation and team working skills, problem solving and self-assessment skills. Integration of PBL and e-learning methods in clinical practice has developed nursing competencies, reflection of learning and peer support of nursing students. The most important results are peer support, feedback and a teacher's encouragement when using e-learning methods.

%X The most common cardiac examination ordered by physicians is the 12 lead ECG, frequently obtained with a computerized recording device that not only provides the ECG tracing but, may also provide the diagnosis. In the past, only persons working in the ECG laboratory were allowed to perform a 12 lead ECG on a patient. Today, however, this task has been delegated to a variety of health professionals, including registered nurses, licensed practice nurses, and even nursing assistants in some health care facilities. New nurses are taught the skill of obtaining a 12 lead ECG during their initial hospital orientation. Because of this, it is not uncommon to have staff development nurses teaching groups of health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG content and skill as many as 5 times in 1 week. For delivery of repetitive content, the use of an interactive CD ROM can be very cost effective. Many health care institutions purchase commercially made CD ROM products, while elsewhere nurse educators develop their own. An interactive CD ROM based on the principles of best practice in education and using embedded virtual reality, was designed by the author to teach nurses, students, and other health professionals how to perform a 12 lead ECG. This article will: 1) describe the interactive CD ROM reality as a teaching methodology; 2) discuss the preliminary evaluation of learning outcomes using CD ROM as the instructional method; and 3) describe the applications interactive CD ROMs may have in nursing practice and education.

%X Many U.S. colleges and universities are discovering innovative and exciting ways of using information technology to promote the process of teaching and learning and to extend education to new populations of students. Nurse educators in academia and service settings are developing interactive e-learning programs or courses to meet this need, and to either enhance practice concepts and basic skills or orient new associates to the clinical organization. In continuing education programs, students need flexibility and convenience to concurrently meet their personal and academic goals, and consumer demand for online instruction is increasing. The challenge is to prepare a comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective e-learning course to meet educational standards and competencies. To meet this challenge, an instructional design model, the Hyperlearning Model, was developed based on Chickering and Gamson's principles of best practices in undergraduate education, to guide the development of an online course for basic critical care content. In this article, I describe the creation and testing of an instructional design model for developing content in this online course.

%X The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM with traditional methods of teaching the skill of performing a 12-lead ECG. A randomized pre/posttest experimental design was used. Seventy-seven baccalaureate nursing students in a required, senior-level critical-care course at a large midwestern university were recruited for the study. Two teaching methods were compared. The traditional method included a self-study module, a brief lecture and demonstration by an instructor, and hands-on experience using a plastic manikin and a real 12-lead ECG machine in the learning laboratory. The second method covered the same content using an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM embedded with virtual reality and supplemented with a self-study module. There were no significant (p < .05) baseline differences in pretest scores between the two groups and no significant differences by group in cognitive gains, student satisfaction with their learning method, or perception of self-efficacy in performing the skill. Overall results indicated that both groups were satisfied with their instructional method and were similar in their ability to demonstrate the skill correctly on a live, simulated patient. This evaluation study is a beginning step to assess new and potentially more cost-effective teaching methods and their effects on student learning outcomes and behaviors, including the transfer of skill acquisition via a computer simulation to a real patient.

%X The use of computerized technology is rapidly growing in the classroom and in healthcare. An emerging computer technology strategy for nursing education is the use of virtual reality simulation. This computer-based three-dimensional educational tool simulates real-life patient experiences in a risk-free environment, allows for repeated practice sessions, requires clinical decision making, exposes students to diverse patient conditions, provides immediate feedback, and is portable. The purpose of this article was to review the importance of virtual reality simulation as a computerized teaching strategy. In addition, a project to explore readiness of nursing faculty at one major Midwestern university for the use of virtual reality simulation as a computerized teaching strategy is described where faculty thought virtual reality simulation would increase students' knowledge of an intravenous line insertion procedure. Faculty who practiced intravenous catheter insertion via virtual reality simulation expressed a wide range of learning experiences from using virtual reality simulation that is congruent with the literature regarding the barriers to student learning. Innovative teaching strategies, such as virtual reality simulation, address barriers of increasing patient acuity, high student-to-faculty ratio, patient safety concerns from faculty, and student anxiety and can offer rapid feedback tostudents.

%X Learning manual skills is a fundamental part of health care education, and motor, sensory and cognitive learning processes are essential aspects of professional development. Simulator training has been shown to enhance factors that facilitate motor and cognitive learning. The present study aimed to investigate the students' experiences and thoughts about their learning through simulation skills training. The study was designed for an educational setting at a clinical skills centre. Ten third-year undergraduate nursing students performed urethral catheterisation, using the virtual reality simulator UrecathVision™, which has haptic properties. The students practised in pairs. Each session was videotaped and the video was used to stimulate recall in subsequent interviews. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis from interviews resulted in three themes: what the students learn, how the students learn, and the simulator's contribution to the students' learning. Students learned manual skills, how to perform the procedure, and professional behaviour. They learned by preparing, watching, practising and reflecting. The simulator contributed by providing opportunities for students to prepare for the skills training, to see anatomical structures, to feel resistance, and to become aware of their own performance ability. The findings show that the students related the task to previous experiences, used sensory information, tested themselves and practised techniques in a hands-on fashion, and reflected in and on action. The simulator was seen as a facilitator to learning the manual skills. The study design, with students working in pairs combined with video recording, was found to enhance opportunities for reflection. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

%X Many health professionals within the UK experience difficulty in accessing further education due to increased workload, reduction in budgets and personal commitments. This paper discusses the redevelopment of a children's pain management (CPM) module to blended e-learning in response to changing workforce needs. The rationale for changing the pedagogy which underpinned the mode of delivery of the module was associated with a number of factors. Reduction in student numbers, difficulties with nurses being released from their practice setting and a desire from stakeholders to maintain pain management education. An on-line questionnaire was utilised to undertake a module evaluation which formed part of the University teaching and learning strategy. Evaluations were generally positive, however, some ethical and professional issues emerged surrounding a lack of study time and level of computer expertise amongst the students. Negotiation is being undertaken with stakeholders to ensure future students are provided with protected study time. Further development with electronic assignment submission will enable the module to be accessible to a wider national and international audience. Change of module delivery to blended e-learning has assisted the health professional to learn in a manner that is adaptable to their workplace and promotes life-long learning by development of independent learning skills. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Aim. This paper is a report of a project to introduce and evaluate methods for using information and communication technologies to involve academic staff, students, and patients in a common synchronous e-learning environment. Background. Although there is no strong evidence for this, there may be benefits in 'efficiency' and for patients and students from shared e-learning. Asynchronous e-learning methods in nursing education are well-established, but synchronous methods have received less attention. However, if feasible, because they are more akin to face-to-face contact, they may be more suitable for patients and may provide a quicker development path for e-learning. Method. We evaluated three synchronous technologies: (1) non-commercial satellite interactive television (TV); (2) Internet videoconferencing; and (3) webcasting, through feasibility studies of 'TV-style' panel discussions on health topics and seminars with interaction with viewers by e-mail, inter-site research meetings with face-to-face interaction, user surveys and literature reviews. Results. Interactive satellite TV required the booking of rooms with specialized receiving equipment. This limited accessibility contributed to the high cost per participant. Videoconferencing proved acceptable for cross-site research meetings and is proposed for joint meetings for doctoral students with overseas centres but has the same access issues as interactive satellite TV. Webcasting is accessible to most users with Internet access and provides a feasible means of delivery of synchronous interactive material. Reported live webcasts have had audiences of thousands. Presentation formats: panel discussions with mixed patient-professional membership and mixed patient-professional audiences were acceptable to participants but engaging academic staff and students was problematic. This may be overcome with webcasting but there may still be barriers such as time-tabling and students' concerns about learning in the same 'live' environment as patients. Conclusions. Limitations in accessibility have been demonstrated for both satellite broadcasts and videoconferencing. Webcasting proved the most acceptable way of supporting a common synchronous environment. Having identified a feasible synchronous method we can now investigate hypothesized benefits for staff, students, and patients of combined e-health e-learning. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X This study confirmed the educational effectiveness of practical exercises (PE) using intravenous (IV) simulators incorporating virtual reality (VR)/haptics (based on the sense of touch) device technologies. First-year nursing students (n= 114) were randomly divided into three PE groups: Group A, utilizing a conventional arm model (IV arm); Group B, utilizing a VR/Haptics IV Simulator (IV sim); and Group C, utilizing both the IV arm and IV sim. Group C scored highest on procedures for conducting venipuncture. Group B was more successful in performing injections than Groups A and C. Group C required significantly less time than Group B to complete a venipuncture injection and was faster than Group A, although this difference was not significant. In conclusion, a new paradigm of PE is suggested using both IV sim and IV arm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Educating health care professionals is a key issue in the provision of quality healthcare services. Interprofessional education has been suggested as a means of meeting this challenge. Four Finnish polytechnics providing education for nurses, social workers and physiotherapists wished to develop the content and methods of teaching the care of the elderly by collaboratively creating and implementing an interprofessional module of 15 European Credit Transfer units, using e-learning. This paper examines the planning and assessment of the impact of the pilot module. The web-based environment eminently suited teaching interprofessional care of the elderly. It supported content and methodological development and renewal of the module. It enabled discussion and collaboration between nursing, social work and rehabilitation teachers and students from the Polytechnics which are located in different parts of Finland. However, it became evident during the pilot that the most crucial challenges of the web-based pedagogy were in the ability of the teacher to supervise, support and motivate students and the organisation of interprofessional learning offered by collaborating institutions. © Taylor & Francis Ltd.

%X Objective To identify a novel method to educate learners in communication and end-of-life care. Background. The use of standardized patients to teach medical and nursing students has been well studied in the realms of communication and physical exam skills. In addition, it is accepted by the adult learner as interactive, experiential, and involves immediate feedback. With more curricular time devoted to end-oflife care, we have found that simulation of the dying patient is a useful way to teach and evaluate learner skills. We present our novel, multidisciplinary experience with an end-of-life patient simulation using role-playing. Methods. We will demonstrate a standardized patient encounter of a patient with end-stage multiple myeloma on hospice, who presents to the emergency department with distressed family for uncontrolled symptoms. During the encounter, the patient (mechanical simulator controlled electronically in real time) declines further and dies. Faculty observe and assess core skills performed. Immediately afterwards, students, faculty, and standardized patients discuss feedback of performance and learners complete a written assessment. Scenarios vary among medical and nursing students based on core skills desired. Results. Twenty-four medical students and 93 nursing students have completed the encounter. The experience was reported to be beneficial in 100% of the encounters. Discussion. This experience has been well received by the learners and provides the faculty with a clear picture of knowledge gaps in communication, family support, and symptom management. It also provides a new forum for inter-professional collaboration. We plan to expand the encounter beginning in July 2012 to include all 120 year 4 medical students and the entire nursing school class. In addition, we will begin collecting pre- and post-encounter data about attitudes and knowledge in end-of-life care. This experience has been well received by the learners and provides the faculty with a clear picture of knowledge gaps in communication, family support, and symptom management. It also provides a new forum for inter-professional collaboration. Conclusion. The use of the standardized patient to teach and evaluate end-of-life skills is useful and appreciated. We will share our experience and outcomes in teaching each desired core skill and provide a visual example of this reproducible teaching tool.

%X High fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) has become an increasingly popular teaching methodology in nursing education. To date, there have not been any published studies investigating HFPS scenarios incorporating medical and psychiatric nursing content. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design to assess if HFPS improved student knowledge and retention of knowledge utilizing three parallel 30-item Elsevier HESI(TM) Custom Exams. A convenience sample of 37 senior level nursing students participated in the study. The results of the study revealed the mean HESI test scores decreased following the simulation intervention although an analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined the difference was not statistically significant (p = .297). Although this study did not reveal improved student knowledge following the HFPS experiences, the findings did provide preliminary evidence that HFPS may improve knowledge in students who are identified as "at-risk." Additionally, students responded favorably to the simulations and viewed them as a positive learning experience.

%X Introduction: The adoption of e-learning platforms can offer a number of benefits including greater learning flexibility in several arenas including healthcare. The present study aims to explore the perceptions of healthcare postgraduate students regarding the adaptability of e-learning and Web-based courses. Methods: The research was based on the four dimensions of the Technology Acceptance Model, i.e. Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Attitude towards use and Behavioural intention. A questionnaire covering these 4 dimensions was created, uploaded on a website and the 39 MSc students enrolled in the Healthcare Management and Health Informatics at the Faculty of Nursing, University of Athens, Greece, invited to complete it. Completed questionnaires were analysed using Partial Least Squares and other statistical techniques. Results: A total of 20 questionnaires were fully completed. Analysis of the results demonstrated that postgraduate students appreciate and perceive usefulness and ease of use as key factors towards using e-learning platforms and online courses. Conclusion: The study has a number of limitations including the small sample size. For that reason, we conducted a downsized modeling scenario in order to produce observations and compare results, in terms of validity. Nevertheless despite these limitations, the current study can be useful in helping to guide the development and implementation of e-learning initiatives. © The Journal on Information Technology in Healthcare 2009.

%X INTRODUCTION: Newly graduated nurses are expected to possess clinical skills and the ability to critically judge quality in patient care. There are an increasing number of baccalaureate nursing (BSN) schools that are integrating the use of patient simulation (PS) in the educational experience of their students. This descriptive study examines the use of PS technology in selected BSN programs in the United States. METHODS: This study targeted National League for Nursing-accredited BSN schools with an online survey related to the current use of PS in course curriculum and how it is being used. Two hundred nine BSN schools were identified and 78 schools responded (37.3% response rate). RESULTS: Sixty (78.9%) BSN schools responded to the survey reported using patient simulators in core clinical nursing courses: health assessment, nursing fundamentals, medical/surgical nursing I and II, pediatrics, and obstetrics courses. Approximately 31% of schools reported using high-fidelity scenarios in more than 51% of their clinical courses. The responding schools indicate that they are using PS in the usual undergraduate nursing courses that coincide with clinical settings. The replacement of actual clinical hours with PS remains controversial and unresolved. Responses to an open-ended question indicated interest in using PS but that many schools are limited by not having a dedicated faculty to champion the way and resources to purchase the technology. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were limitations to this study, it is one of the first to describe the patterns of using PS in nursing schools for clinical education. As the use of this technology grows in BSN programs, addressing the issues resulting from this study are essential to understanding the use of this technology in nursing education.

%X Training medics, medical students, nurses, and residents to perform trauma care skills presents many obstacles. These include: emergent nature of the procedures, instructor time, availability of clinical material, and anatomic knowledge. Virtual Reality simulators address each of these obstacles. The National Capital Area Medical Simulation Center is a unique national asset that not only uses state-of-the-art simulators to teach trauma care skills to medical students and others, but adapts existing technology and develops new simulations to teach these skills. Most standard trauma training is performed on either mannequins or anesthetized animals and requires the constant presence of an instructor. VR applications can be stand-alone devices that have built-in scenarios and multiple patients to increase variation and/or level of technical expertise required to successfully complete the required steps of the trauma procedure. Commercial VR simulators to teach trauma skills include: CathSim Intravenous Simulator (HT Medical), UltraSim Ultrasound Simulator (MedSim), Limb Trauma Simulator (Musculographics/BDI), and the Human Patient Simulator (MedSim). Additionally, we have developed two additional simulators based on the HT CathSim; these are the pericardiocentesis simulator and the diagnostic peritoneal lavage simulator. Future applications include virtual environment triage simulation and surgical airway simulators.

%X Context: Absence of standardised pain curricula has led to wide diversity in the understanding and awareness of pain by healthcare students. Indeed pain management is frequently under-prioritised in nursing education, providing potential to negatively impact upon patient care. Yet the recent addition of Pain to the UK National Health Service's Essence of Care Benchmarks has highlighted the need to address this issue, and in response pain educators have called for the development of high quality, globally accessible e-learning resources in pain management. Objectives: This study will determine the effectiveness of an e-learning intervention on pain management developed for nursing students. Methods: Two variants of an e-learning resource on pain management were developed, each containing the same core content but one with a section focusing on pain assessment and the other on pharmacological management. Nursing students (n = 42) were randomly assigned to trial one resource, after which they undertook a questionnaire adapted (to ensure alignment with the content of the e-learning resources) from Ferrell and McCaffrey's Nurses Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Pain Survey. Scores were analysed for each resource and year of study, and compared with scores from a standard non-intervention group completing the questionnaire only (n = 164). Results: Scores averaged 19.2% higher for students undertaking the e-learning resources (p < 0.005). Specifically, undertaking the assessment resource improved assessment knowledge more, whilst assignment to the treatment resource particularly enhanced pharmacological knowledge (p < 0.005). Correlation was found between year of study and pain knowledge. Conclusion: Results support the effectiveness of the resources independent of voluntary-response bias. Conclusions recommend that introducing e-learning has substantial benefit to enhance pain education in nursing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

%X BACKGROUND: Recognising and responding to patients who are deteriorating are key aspects to improving outcomes. Simulations provide students with exposure to deteriorating patient scenarios and the role of nurses in such events. The number of programmes seeking to provide best possible simulation experiences is growing exponentially. Robust evaluation of these experiences is crucial to ensure maximum benefit.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a deteriorating patient simulation experience on students' technical and communication skills; and to determine if differing study programmes and years of previous nursing experience influenced students' responses and experiences.
METHODS: A convenience sample of final year nursing students (N=57) in a medical-surgical course at a large urban university completed a descriptive pre/post simulation survey rating their technical skills and communication abilities in recognising and responding to patient deterioration. Changes in pre/post scores were analysed including influence of study programme (3-year, 2-year Enrolled Nurse, 2-year Graduate Entry); gender; and years nursing experience (beyond course clinical practicum).
RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in post-simulation survey scores were demonstrated for combined student group data. Students with greater years of nursing experience had statistically higher scores than those with less experience in both pre- and post-surveys. Specific improvements were identified for: assessing a deteriorating patient; and in seeking help from the medical officer or external service.
CONCLUSIONS: All student groups gained benefit in participating in a deteriorating patient simulation. For this group, greater years of prior nursing experience led to higher pre- and post-survey scores. The learning activity provided students an experience of the importance of recognising and responding to an acute situation in a timely manner which may be recalled in subsequent clinical situations.

%X Despite technologic advances in task trainers and manikins, there persists an inability to replicate key clinical skills as would occur in clinical settings. This report provides details of a project to develop a functional and reliable tympanic thermal simulator prototype that could be embedded into the ear of a manikin to enable tympanic thermometers to be used during simulation encounters. A simple electrical circuit was built using (i) a standard 9-V battery, (ii) a switch, (iii) 5 × 62-Ω resistors in parallel for circuit stability, (iv) a 62-Ω resistor in parallel with (v) a 1-kΩ potentiometer to vary the infrared light-emitting diode (IRLED) intensity, and (vi) 2 IRLEDs. After confirming reliability of circuit performance, the IRLEDs were implanted into the ear of a manikin. Over 3 consecutive days, 3033 samples were recorded simulating a range of human body temperatures, controlled by altering current flow. Initial testing of the thermal simulator prototype indicates that a range of human temperatures (34.0°C-41.9°C) can be generated using high-intensity IRLEDs. Although, at higher applied current levels, the variation in measured temperature was larger (2.4°C) than at lower applied currents (0.2°C), reasonably precise temperatures were achieved. Testing and reporting initial prototype results are an important first step in developing and refining a useful product to enhance manikin capabilities associated with patient physical assessment in the simulation setting. Despite the undesired variation, the current design could still be used for teaching purposes in educational settings. Retrieving tympanic temperatures during "patient assessment" of the simulator benefits nursing, midwifery, and other health care students by enabling authentic practice. Further development of this prototype is required to improve the reliability, precision, and accuracy of the device.

%X E-learning is regularly promoted in higher education settings as a way of fostering more flexible approaches to learning. It has been argued however that the 'potential benefits of new information and communication technology instruments in education' have not been subjected to critical scrutiny (Debande, O., 2004. ICTs and the development of e-learning in Europe: the role of the public and private sectors. European Journal of Education 39 (2), 191-208, p. 192). This paper outlines a multi-method evaluation of an e-learning innovation designed to teach clinical skills to student nurses. Responding to the challenges of teaching clinical skills to large class sizes, we developed a set of instructional videos for one undergraduate skills-based module, which are now integral to the module and available online to students on a continuous basis. Evaluation suggests that students' performance outcomes are unchanged. The students view the flexible and self-management aspects of this method of learning positively, with some attitudinal differences between male and female, and mature and non-mature students. However, it is best used to complement rather than replace lecturer demonstration, lending support to a 'blended' model (Collis, B., van der Wende, M., 2002.

%X Purpose Medical imaging is essential for the diagnosis and therapy of patients across a broad spectrum of medical disciplines. Imaging data is required at different points of the surgical treatment process in different modes of presentation. Traditional ways of viewing medical imaging data (i.e., Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) workstations) in a stacked fashion removed from the patient may change with virtual and augmented reality (AR). We firstly present a new, interactive and immersive method of visualizing preoperative planning data with a 3D virtual reality framework using the head-mounted display (HMD) Oculus Rift™ (Oculus VR LLC, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and show feasibility, assess satisfaction and acceptance of the technology and evaluate its potential by medical professionals, Fig. 1. Secondly we present a mobile, real-time and point-of-care augmented reality system for medical diagnosis and therapy and evaluated it with regard to feasibility and accuracy in a pilot study involving phantom, animal, and human models, Fig. 2. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of virtual and augmented reality in the surgical treatment process. Methods For virtual reality we selected a sample case of a colorectal cancer patient with multiple hepatic metastases planned for liver resection. We segmented the liver and gallbladder surface, the arterial, venous and portal venous vasculature, the bile ducts and the liver tumors with a defined security margin from a CT-scan using the arterial and venous phases. We used the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg) for organ and vessel segmentation. Post-processing was carried out with MeshMixer (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA). We used the virtual reality HMD to visualize the intraoperative anatomical situation in the abdomen. By using the HMD the surgeon could access the three-dimensionally visualized upper abdomen, clinical patient data and the original CT images. We evaluated user satisfaction, acceptance and potential by an online questionnaire. For augmented reality computed tomography imaging was realized and a tablet computer was positioned above the patient and a semi-transparent 3D-representation of structures of interest were superimposed on top of the patient's image resulting in augmented reality. Live camera images and the three-dimensional volume were registered by fiducial markers. Feasibility and accuracy were evaluated in a static model using the open source Heidelberg Laparoscopy Phantom (openHELP). The system was further analyzed in a porcine animal study. The reprojection error for both phantom and animal studies was defined as the average offset of the back-projected two-dimensional image points and the manually defined points in the three-dimensional volume. Finally the setup was tested with a human volunteer to prove basic feasibility for clinical application. Results We evaluated the virtual reality system with attending surgeons (n = 13), resident surgeons (n = 34), medical students (n = 57), surgical nurses (n = 52) and non-medical staff (n = 22). In total 180 evaluations were performed. 89 % of the users were satisfied with the virtual reality scene, 90 % saw its potential to better evaluate complex surgical cases, 87 % found it useful in the training of medical students, 85 % in surgical training and 56 % in the training of nurses. 80 % saw high clinical potential of this technology. The AR-System was successfully realized in the phantom, animal and human model. In the phantom model of the 1380 analyzed AR-positions 83.9 % could be successfully realized. The reprojection error was 2.83 ± 2.68 mm. 95 % of the measurements were below 6.71 mm. In the animal model 79.3 % of the 690 analyzed AR-positions could be successfully realized. In the animal study the reprojection error was 3.52 ± 3.00 mm. 95 % of the measurements were below 9.49 mm. The reprojection error was significantly lower in the phantom model compared to the porcine model (P<0.001). At last augmented reality was successfully ealized in clinical case. Conclusion Novel methods of image visualization and interaction are feasible, accurate and clinically practicable. Three-dimensional surgery planning and simulation in combination with immersive virtual reality can prove beneficial for complex liver resections, possibly improving patient care. It may also help younger surgeons to better understand the underlying anatomy of a surgical case and the reasoning behind the surgical decision-making processes. Secondly, mobile, real-time and point-of-care augmented reality systems for clinical purposes are feasible and accurate in a realistic experimental setting. (Figure presented).

%X Learning may be enhanced in mental health nursing education by applying virtual reality technologies in which students may safely practice communication and assessment skills with simulated patients. The purpose of this descriptive study was to assess the effectiveness of a Second Life® (SL) virtual simulation as a teaching strategy for undergraduate mental health nursing students. Data were collected via a researcher-developed survey questionnaire. Students perceived the simulation to be moderately effective as an educational strategy and slightly difficult as a technical program. Positive aspects included client assessment in an environment where mistakes were without consequence, working from home, and novelty. Drawbacks were dressing and maneuvering the avatar and lack of realism. Correlations were found between educational effectiveness and technical difficulty and between educational effectiveness and age of the computer. SL virtual simulation has potential to provide unique, easily accessible, safe, and fun learning for mental health nursing students. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the period of retention of ACLS skills is different between medical students and registered nurses. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed. Medical students and registered nurses were trained both BLS and ACLS based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 2005 Guidelines tools, and evaluated by skill performance tests based on the AHA 2005 BLS and ACLS tools in simulated environment, at immediately and 3 months after training. The registered nurses were similarly evaluated also at 9 months after training. RESULTS: A total of 197 medical students enrolled was trained, being assigned to 30 groups. Twenty four registered nurses in a general ward were trained, being assigned to 6 groups. In 3 months after training, the medical students retained the core skills of chest compression, which included the correct rate and adequate depth of chest compressions, delivering 30 compressions and 2 ventilations, and resuming chest compressions after shocks, whereas checking breathing, 2 ventilations with bag-valve-mask, or checking carotid pulse was done in only 33% of all groups. The airway management and drug use in the secondary ACLS survey and the effective communication and team dynamics were done in 30%-50% of all groups. The registered nurses also retained the core skills of chest compression and drug use in 3 months after training. Especially, effective communication and team dynamics were well-retained in all groups. In 9 months after training the registered nurses also retained, whereas both opening airway and first 2 ventilations were done in 50% of all groups. Checking carotid pulse or checking breathing was little done for at least 5 seconds but no more than 10 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: Through BLS and ACLS training, the registered nurses have well retained resuscitation skills, but they also have well demonstrated effective communication and team dynamics for longer period than medical students. Medical students are required short interval of retraining ACLS skills with team dynamics, similarly healthcare providers without performing resuscitation as daily work may be. In addition to this, it should be important to apply effectively different way to teach ACLS skills, such as e-learning or self-training.

%X The purpose of this study was to develop a PBL package for maternal and newborn care and apply e-learning multimedia contents for PBL. During the first semester of 2005, 64 Nursing students of a college were subjected to the e-learning multimedia contents for PBL. This course was blended so that part of the class sessions were held in a face to face setting and the other classes were held online. Learners' reactions and their instructional performance were measured.E-learning multimedia contents, composed of a learning contents system, PBL systems and an administrator/professor system, were developed. Ratings of their reactions as learners and of instructional performance averaged 3.3 points and 3.9 points (on a scale of 5) respectively. Some benefits of this program as reported by the learners are: the moving pictures similar to clinical situations, distinctive experience, ease of understanding, time saving, repetitive learning, etc. The nursing students reported this program was a positive experience and that it encouraged self-directed learning.

%X Objective: To identify, catalog, and critically evaluate Web-based resources for critical care education. Data Sources: A multilevel search strategy was utilized. Literature searches were conducted (from 1996 to September 30, 2010) using OVID-MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature with the terms "Web-based learning," "computer-assisted instruction," "e-learning, " "critical care," "tutorials," "continuing education," "virtual learning," and "Web-based education." The Web sites of relevant critical care organizations (American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Thoracic Society, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care Medicine, World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine, American Association of Critical Care Nurses, and World Federation of Critical Care Nurses) were reviewed for the availability of e-learning resources. Finally, Internet searches and e-mail queries to critical care medicine fellowship program directors and members of national and international acute/critical care listserves were conducted to 1) identify the use of and 2) review and critique Web-based resources for critical care education. Data Extraction and Data Synthesis: To ensure credibility of Web site information, Web sites were reviewed by three independent reviewers on the basis of the criteria of authority, objectivity, authenticity, accuracy, timeliness, relevance, and efficiency in conjunction with suggested formats for evaluating Web sites in the medical literature. Measurements and Main Results: Literature searches using OVID-MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature resulted in >250 citations. Those pertinent to critical care provide examples of the integration of e-learning techniques, the development of specific resources, reports of the use of types of e-learning, including interactive tutorials, case studies, and simulation, and reports of student or learner satisfaction, among other general reviews of the benefits of utilizing e-learning. Review of the Web sites of relevant critical care organizations revealed the existence of a number of e-learning resources, including online critical care courses, tutorials, podcasts, webcasts, slide sets, and continuing medical education resources, some requiring membership or a fee to access. Respondents to listserve queries (>100) and critical care medicine fellowship director and advanced practice nursing educator e-mail queries (>50) identified the use of a number of tutorials, self-directed learning modules, and video-enhanced programs for critical care education and practice. Conclusions: In all, >135 Web-based education resources exist, including video Web resources for critical care education in a variety of e-learning formats, such as tutorials, self-directed learning modules, interactive case studies, webcasts, podcasts, and video-enhanced programs. As identified by critical care educators and practitioners, e-learning is actively being integrated into critical care medicine and nursing training programs for continuing medical education and competency training purposes. Knowledge of available Web-based educational resources may enhance critical care practitioners ongoing learning and clinical competence, although this has not been objectively measured to date. © 2011 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

%X Background: Nurse-led gastrointestinal endoscopy is a priority clinical area in the UK. Endoscopic procedures are challenging to learn, requiring a combination of technical competence (manipulating a flexible endoscope and interpreting the findings) and interpersonal skills (engaging effectively with a conscious patient who is frequently apprehensive). This paper explores the potential of an innovative, scenario-based approach which links a simulated patient with a computer-driven virtual reality (VR) training device for flexible sigmoidoscopy. Within this safe yet realistic quasi-clinical environment, learners carry out the procedure while interacting with the 'patient'. Communication skills are assessed by simulated patients, while quantitative performance data relating to the procedure is generated automatically by the VR simulator. Methods: This pilot study took place within a nurse practitioner endoscopy course. A mixed methodology combined qualitative and quantitative data (observation and interview studies, communication rating scales and a range of computer-generated output measures from the VR simulator) in a multifaceted evaluation. Results: Seven nurses took part in the study. Participants found the scenarios to be a convincing and powerful learning experience. All experienced high levels of anxiety. Simulated patients identified strengths in participants' communication skills, together with areas for development. Simulator-based practice led to an improvement in objective performance measures. Discussion: Scenario-based training provides a powerful learning experience, allowing participants to build their technical expertise and apply it within a holistic clinical context without the risk of causing harm. We used this pilot study as a springboard for discussions over wider implications of procedure-based skills training, locating it within the literature on expertise and situated learning.

%X Introduction In the United Kingdom, practical training in neonatal resuscitation is a requirement for neonatal practitioners. Good quality, effective resuscitation can improve short and long term outcomes and prevent many immediate perinatal complications. Resuscitation skills deteriorate rapidly if not used daily. A particularly rapid loss of skills occurs in the first 3-6 months after attending a resuscitation course. Currently there is no formal program for refresher training in neonatal resuscitation skills in the four year period until mandatory recertification. E-learning and video based training has been shown to be an effective means of teaching and refreshing adult and paediatric resuscitation skills. Aims/Method This study evaluated whether a 'refresher' training video could improve performance in neonatal healthcare professionals. We produced a 3 min video with voiceover, demonstrating key neonatal resuscitation skills. Eighty six clinical staff members (32 midwives, 31 neonatal nurses and 23 doctors) volunteered to participate in the study; their neonatal resuscitation skills were assessed before and after viewing the video. Results There was a statistically significant improvement in all skills assessed across all professional groups after viewing the video. Key results: 59% of midwives delivered effective inflation breaths pre video compared to 96% post video (P = 0.0005). Nurses' checking of the correct set up of resuscitation equipment improved from 64% to 93% (P = 0.0001). Sixty-five percent of doctors checked the Positive End-Expiratory (PEEP) pressures before seeing the video, increasing to 100% afterwards (P = 0.0072). Conclusion Videos such as this could form part of a training package available to staff who wish to refresh their resuscitation skills through self-directed learning, or become part of mandatory training updates.

%X Education on the care of aggressive and disturbed patients is fragmentary. eLearning could ensure the quality of such education, but data on its impact on professional competence of the staff are insufficient. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of ePsychNurse.Net, an eLearning course, on psychiatric nurses' professional competence in seclusion and restraint and on their job satisfaction and general self-efficacy. The study showed that the ePsychNurse.Net, an affordable and easy-to-access learning instrument may, with certain reservations, be recommended for the continuing vocational education of nursing staff in psychiatric institutions. ePsychNurse.Net is worth further development with more flexible time schedules and individualization of content. Education on the care of aggressive and disturbed patients is fragmentary. eLearning could ensure the quality of such education, but data on its impact on professional competence in psychiatry are lacking. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of ePsychNurse.Net, an eLearning course, on psychiatric nurses' professional competence in seclusion and restraint and on their job satisfaction and general self-efficacy. In a randomized controlled study, 12 wards were randomly assigned to ePsychNurse.Net (intervention) or education as usual (control). Baseline and 3-month follow-up data on nurses' knowledge of coercion-related legislation, physical restraint and seclusion, their attitudes towards physical restraint and seclusion, job satisfaction and general self-efficacy were analysed for 158 completers. Knowledge (primary outcome) of coercion-related legislation improved in the intervention group, while knowledge of physical restraint improved and knowledge of seclusion remained unchanged in both groups. General self-efficacy improved in the intervention group also attitude to seclusion in the control group. In between-group comparison, attitudes to seclusion (one of secondary outcomes) favoured the control group. Although the ePsychNurse.Net demonstrated only slight advantages over conventional learning, it may be worth further development with, e.g. flexible time schedule and individualized content. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing.

%X Background: The management of psychiatric inpatients exhibiting severely disturbed and aggressive behaviour is an important educational topic. Well structured, IT-based educational programmes (eLearning) often ensure quality and may make training more affordable and accessible. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of an eLearning course for personnel on the rates and duration of seclusion and mechanical restraint among psychiatric inpatients. Methods: In a cluster-randomized intervention trial, the nursing personnel on 10 wards were randomly assigned to eLearning (intervention) or training-as-usual (control) groups. The eLearning course comprised six modules with specific topics (legal and ethical issues, behaviour-related factors, therapeutic relationship and self-awareness, teamwork and integrating knowledge with practice) and specific learning methods. The rates (incidents per 1000 occupied bed days) and durations of the coercion incidents were examined before and after the course. Results: A total of 1283 coercion incidents (1143 seclusions [89%] and 140 incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints [11%]) were recorded on the study wards during the data collection period. On the intervention wards, there were no statistically significant changes in the rates of seclusion and mechanical restraint. However, the duration of incidents involving mechanical restraints shortened from 36.0 to 4.0 h (median) (P < 0.001). No statistically significant changes occurred on the control wards. Conclusions: After our eLearning course, the duration of incidents involving the use of mechanical restraints decreased. However, more studies are needed to ensure that the content of the course focuses on the most important factors associated with the seclusion-related elements. The eLearning course deserves further development and further studies. The duration of coercion incidents merits attention in future research.

%X The nursing literature supports the need for end-of-life (EOL) education, but the ability to provide quality clinical experience in this area is limited by the availability of patients and nursing instructors' and preceptors' comfort and expertise in teaching EOL care. Clinical simulation allows faculty to provide the same quality EOL experience to all students. This article discusses an effective teaching strategy integrating End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium core content with National League for Nursing ACE.S unfolding case studies, clinical simulation, and social media.

%X Background: mLearning is increasingly presented as an attractive novel educational strategy for medical and nursing education. Yet, evidence base for its effectiveness or factors which influence use, success, implementation or adoption are not clear. We aim to synthesise findings from qualitative studies to provide insight into the factors (barriers and facilitators) influencing adoption, implementation and use of mobile devices for learning in medical and nursing education. The review also aims to identify factors or actions which are considered to optimise the experience and satisfaction of educators and learners in using mobile technologies for medical and nursing education and to identify strategies for improving mLearning interventions for medical and nursing education. Methods: A systematic search will be conducted across a range of databases for studies describing or evaluating the experiences, barriers, facilitators and factors pertaining to the use of mLearning for medical and nursing education. The framework synthesis approach will be used to organise and bring different components of the results together. The confidence in the qualitative review findings will be assessed using the CERQual approach. Discussion: This study will contribute to the planning and design of effective mLearning and the development of mLearning guidelines for medical and nursing education.

%X Background & Hypothesis: The rise in the ageing population demands an increase in geriatric medicine-trained healthcare providers. Geriatric nursing is not a popular choice. Many cite it as boring, unglamorous, tedious and draining. This negative attitude can affect the older adult's quality of care. We hypothesise that an interprofessional geriatric e-learning module focusing on the essence of geriatric medicine can change attitudes with a resultant career choice in geriatric nursing. Methods: A cohort study of 9 second year nursing students was done. An e-learning module concentrating on multidisciplinary interprofessional collaboration was created. Baseline demographics and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) attitudes scale pre and post e-learning module were collected. Responses as to whether they would consider geriatric nursing upon graduation were collected. Paired t-test compared the change in scores pre and post e-learning module. Statistical significance was taken as P ≤0.05. Results: A total of 77.8% of our cohort was female and 88.9% single. Their pre e-learning UCLA score was 3.35 +/- 0.41 and their post UCLA score was 3.63 +/- 0.46. Unfortunately, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.20). In spite of this improvement in their attitudes towards older adults, 77.8% of them did not intend to go into geriatric nursing giving reasons like indecisiveness and inadequate exposure. Discussion & Conclusion: The e-learning module improved nurisng students' attitudes towards older adults. However, this does not translate into them wanting to do geriatric nursing. Future studies should incorporate the elearning module into their geriatric practicum to study the effect on attitudinal change.

%X Evidenced-based educational practices propose simulation as a valuable teaching and learning strategy to promote situated cognition and clinical reasoning to teach nursing students how to solve problems. A project that uses a structured debriefing activity, the Outcome Present State-Test Model of clinical reasoning following high fidelity patient simulation, is described in this paper. The results of this project challenge faculty to create and manage patient simulation scenarios that coordinate with didactic content and clinical experiences to direct student learning for the best reinforcement of clinical reasoning outcomes. Considerations for the future include incorporating patient simulation activities as part of student evaluation and curriculum development. The arguments for using high fidelity patient simulation in the current educational environment has obvious short term benefits, however, the long term benefit of developing clinical expertise remains to be discovered.

%X There is a need to develop cost effective ways to bring hands-on education about essential information technologies, such as electronic health record (EHR) systems to nursing students, nursing faculty and practitioners. This is especially the case as worldwide there is an increased deployment of these systems and they are transforming the practice of healthcare. However, due to technical, financial and knowledge limitations, many nursing schools and programs do not have an adequate way to bring such technology into their classes and curricula. In this paper we describe an approach to developing Web-based EHR education that allows students from any Web-accessible location to access and work with real EHR systems remotely over the Internet for learning purposes. In this paper we describe our work in moving this approach to a cloud-based solution to allow access to EHRs for educational purposes from any location with Web access and to do so in a way that is both educationally sound and cost effective.

%X BACKGROUND: Continuing education is essential in improving practical psychiatric nursing skills. However, little is known about how knowledge gained in continuing education is transferred to nurses' daily work.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the transfer of knowledge gained from an e-learning course to daily practice.
DESIGN: Qualitative study design.
SETTINGS: One hospital district in Southern Finland with three specialized psychiatric wards (acute, rehabilitation, geriatric wards).
PARTICIPANTS: Nursing staff (N=53) were recruited and 35 participated voluntarily in the e-learning continuing education course in spring 2009.
METHODS: The data comprised nurses' reflective writing during the e-learning course and course evaluation forms completed after the course. We used qualitative design with inductive content analysis to analyze nurses' writings.
RESULTS: The nurses were willing and able to transfer what they learned to their daily practice including the course themes, communication and co-operation among staff members, understanding of preventive and alternative treatment methods and critical thinking regarding one's own work. After the e-learning course the nurses were able to identify development areas such as issues related to staff members' daily work, the patient's role on the ward, alternative methods to avoid coercion, issues pertaining to the care environment on the ward, psychiatric nurses' education, and making an action plan for aggressive situations. All nurses would recommend the course to other nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: New knowledge is easily adopted and transferred to daily practice.

%X Background: In order to deliver safe and effective patient care in the operating room, staff must work together as a team. Teamwork requires closed-loop communication and the ability to anticipate events. Studies have shown that interdisciplinary simulation exercises improve the efficiency with which health care providers and other ancillary staff respond to highacuity situations. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that multimedia resources help learners recall and retain information. 360-degree video is an emerging multimedia platform, which allows users to be visually immersed in a video. Using this technology and these premises we are working with the OR nursing staff to create high-fidelity simulations and recording them in 360-degrees. Methods: Quarterly group simulations were held with members of the nursing staff, surgical team, and anesthesia team. Participants were notified in advance that a simulation exercise was planned but details of the scenario were not disclosed. To date we have done a pediatric surgery scenario and a pediatric post-anesthesia care scenario in 360-degree video. To create a realistic experience the perioperative environment was set-up in the normal fashion using standard equipment and a mannequin patient. A 360-degree, six GoPro camera mount was positioned in the center of the room to record the simulation. Individual videos were then downloaded to a VR-capable, custom build PC and stitched together using Autopano Video Pro. The final video was uploaded to Youtube, allowing anyone with a mobile phone or computer to view it in 360-degrees. Results: Rendering 360-degree videos from six GoPro cameras was successful with good resolution and sound. The video could be viewed from a computer, mobile device, or virtual reality headsets. Initial reception of the 360-degree recordings of the simulation was positive. OR staff who viewed the videos stated that the ability to view everything occurring simultaneously allowed them to better understand the overall scenario. Learners commented that it enabled them to discern their own individual roles within the group as well as the ongoing interplay between different services. Conclusion: 360-degree videos provide distinct advantages over traditional videos when used for interdisciplinary simulation because it provides the participant a vantage point otherwise unobtainable. Being able to view the entire room through one video stream allows an individual from any service or even hospital administration to review safety protocols in place and ascertain if there are deficiencies in training or resources needed to respond appropriately to high-acuity situations. Additional work is required to ascertain the optimal positioning of the camera as well as improving the stitching and processing of the video.

%X Aim: This paper details the experience of establishing an integrated skills training centre for use in undergraduate nursing education in The Open University of Hong Kong. Background: Skills training is an essential element in undergraduate nursing education. Owing to the increasing complexity of the health-care system and patient health needs, undergraduate nursing students should be well prepared for integrated skills competency, critical thinking and rapid decision-making. To achieve this goal, the use of simulation as a skills training tool is being recommended. Conclusion: The Clinical Nursing Education Centre is established. It adopts simulation as a teaching and learning tool. It has four specific education units, namely: (1) clinical simulation education unit, (2) virtual reality education unit, (3) nursing skills education unit, and (4) Chinese medicinal education unit. These units are specifically designed for the teaching and learning of nursing skills related to general, mental and Chinese medicinal nursing from elementary to advanced level. Experiences pertaining to the conceptualization, exploration and actualization phases of the establishment are presented. Details of the structure and specific functions of the centre are also illustrated. Finally, there is discussion on the challenges encountered during the establishment process and how they were overcome. © 2010 The Authors.

%X Background: Safe medication management is a major competency taught in the nursing curriculum. However, administering pediatric medications is considered a common clinical stressor for Taiwanese students. A supplemental e-learning program that helps students fill the gap between basic nursing skills and pediatric knowledge on medication safety was developed. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an e-learning program to increase pediatric medication management among students who take pediatric nursing courses. Design: This intervention study used a historical comparison design. Setting: A university in Northern Taiwan. Participants: A total of 349 undergraduate nursing students who took pediatric nursing courses participated. Eighty students in the comparison group received regular pediatric courses, including the lectures and clinical practicum; 269 students in the intervention group received an e-learning program, in addition to the standard pediatric courses. Methods: Between February 2011 and July 2012 pediatric medication management, including pediatric medication knowledge and calculation ability, was measured at the beginning of the first class, at the completion of the lectures, and at the completion of the clinical practicum. The program was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: The intervention group had significantly higher pediatric medication management scores at completion of the lecture course and at the completion of the clinical practicum than the comparison group based on the first day of the lecture course, after adjusting for age, nursing program, and having graduated from a junior college in nursing. Overall, the students appreciated the program that included various teaching modalities content that related to the administration of medication. Conclusion: Using an e-learning program on pediatric medication management is an effective learning method in addition to sitting in a regular lecture course. The different emphases in each module, provided by experienced instructors, enabled the students to be more aware of their role in pediatric medication safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Virtual environments offer a variety of benefits and may be a powerful medium with which to provide nursing education. The objective of this study was to compare the achievement of learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students when a virtual patient trainer or a traditional lecture was used to teach pediatric respiratory content. This was a randomized, controlled, posttest design. A virtual pediatric hospital unit was populated with four virtual pediatric patients having different respiratory diseases that were designed to meet the same learning objectives as a traditional lecture. The study began in Spring 2010 with 93 Senior I, baccalaureate nursing students. Students were randomized to receive either a traditional lecture or an experience with a virtual patient trainer. Students' knowledge acquisition was evaluated using multiple-choice questions, and knowledge application was measured as timeliness of care in two simulated clinical scenarios using high-fidelity mannequins and standardized patients. Ninety-three students participated in the study, of which 46 were in the experimental group that received content using the virtual patient trainer. After the intervention, students in the experimental group had significantly higher knowledge acquisition (P = 0.004) and better knowledge application (P = 0.001) for each of the two scenarios than students in the control group. The purpose of this project was to compare a virtual patient trainer to a traditional lecture for the achievement of learning outcomes for pediatric respiratory content. Although the virtual patient trainer experience produced statistically better outcomes, the differences may not be clinically significant. The results suggest that a virtual patient trainer may be an effective substitute for the achievement of learning outcomes that are typically met using a traditional lecture format. Further research is needed to understand how best to integrate a virtual patient trainer into undergraduate nursing education.

%X The advent of eLearning has seen online discussion forums widely used in both undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education. This paper reports an Australian university experience of design, delivery and redevelopment of a distance education module developed for Vietnamese nurse academics. The teaching experience of Vietnamese nurse academics is mixed and frequently limited. It was decided that the distance module should attempt to utilise the experience of senior Vietnamese nurse academics - asynchronous online discussion groups were used to facilitate this. Online discussion occurred in both Vietnamese and English and was moderated by an Australian academic working alongside a Vietnamese translator. This paper will discuss the design of an online learning environment for foreign correspondents, the resources and translation required to maximise the success of asynchronous online discussion groups, as well as the rationale of delivering complex content in a foreign language. While specifically addressing the first iteration of the first distance module designed, this paper will also address subsequent changes made for the second iteration of the module and comment on their success. While a translator is clearly a key component of success, the elements of simplicity and clarity combined with supportive online moderation must not be overlooked. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X BACKGROUND: Virtual patient simulation has grown substantially in health care education. A virtual patient simulation was developed as a refresher training course to reinforce nursing clinical performance in assessing and managing deteriorating patients.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the development of the virtual patient simulation and evaluate its efficacy, by comparing with a conventional mannequin-based simulation, for improving the nursing students' performances in assessing and managing patients with clinical deterioration.
METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 57 third-year nursing students who were recruited through email. After a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated environment, the experimental group received a 2-hour fully automated virtual patient simulation while the control group received 2-hour facilitator-led mannequin-based simulation training. All participants were then re-tested one day (first posttest) and 2.5 months (second posttest) after the intervention. The participants from the experimental group completed a survey to evaluate their learning experiences with the newly developed virtual patient simulation.
RESULTS: Compared to their baseline scores, both experimental and control groups demonstrated significant improvements (P<.001) in first and second post-test scores. While the experimental group had significantly lower (P<.05) second post-test scores compared with the first post-test scores, no significant difference (P=.94) was found between these two scores for the control group. The scores between groups did not differ significantly over time (P=.17). The virtual patient simulation was rated positively.
CONCLUSIONS: A virtual patient simulation for a refreshing training course on assessing and managing clinical deterioration was developed. Although the randomized controlled study did not show that the virtual patient simulation was superior to mannequin-based simulation, both simulations have demonstrated to be effective refresher learning strategies for improving nursing students' clinical performance. Given the greater resource requirements of mannequin-based simulation, the virtual patient simulation provides a more promising alternative learning strategy to mitigate the decay of clinical performance over time.

%X AIM: To explore the effect of an innovative simulation education programme on nursing students' transition-to-practice experiences.
BACKGROUND: Academic-practice partnership is emerging as an important vehicle for improving nursing students' transition-to-practice. Using existing university resources, academic educators and alumni developed an innovative simulation educational programme known as the Simulated Professional Learning Environment (SIMPLE) to align the educational process with the realities of nursing practice. Educators and alumni collaborated to create and facilitate 15 hours of simulation sessions that comprised the learning platform for the SIMPLE programme.
DESIGN: This was a descriptive qualitative study.
METHOD: Focus groups were conducted in 2012 with 22 final-year nursing students completing their transition-to-practice clinical practicum. The interview transcripts were analysed using content analysis.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified from the analysis: 'experiencing the role of staff nurse'; 'knowing how to'; and 'learning from the 'seniors'. Experiencing the role of staff nurse in the programme showed the nursing students what to expect and how to prepare for their roles. Knowing how to focus on holistic patient care, manage 'difficult' clients and communicate with other healthcare professionals were the learning outcomes gained from the programme. Learning from the 'seniors' about hospital work processes positively influenced the nurses' transition-to-practice experiences.
CONCLUSION: This study provides support for introducing the simulation education programme as an enhancement during nursing students' final year to improve their transition-to-practice experiences. A stronger collaborative relationship between academic educators and practising nurses could be further fostered by expanding this learning platform.

%X BACKGROUND: Web-based learning is becoming an increasingly important instructional tool in nursing education. Multimedia advancements offer the potential for creating authentic nursing activities for developing nursing competency in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive multimedia Web-based simulation for developing nurses' competencies in acute nursing care.
METHODS: Authentic nursing activities were developed in a Web-based simulation using a variety of instructional strategies including animation video, multimedia instructional material, virtual patients, and online quizzes. A randomized controlled study was conducted on 67 registered nurses who were recruited from the general ward units of an acute care tertiary hospital. Following a baseline evaluation of all participants' clinical performance in a simulated clinical setting, the experimental group received 3 hours of Web-based simulation and completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions of the program. All participants were re-tested for their clinical performances using a validated tool.
RESULTS: The clinical performance posttest scores of the experimental group improved significantly (P<.001) from the pretest scores after the Web-based simulation. In addition, compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher clinical performance posttest scores (P<.001) after controlling the pretest scores. The participants from the experimental group were satisfied with their learning experience and gave positive ratings for the quality of the Web-based simulation. Themes emerging from the comments about the most valuable aspects of the Web-based simulation include relevance to practice, instructional strategies, and fostering problem solving.
CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in authentic nursing activities using interactive multimedia Web-based simulation can enhance nurses' competencies in acute care. Web-based simulations provide a promising educational tool in institutions where large groups of nurses need to be trained in acute nursing care and accessibility to repetitive training is essential for achieving long-term retention of clinical competency.

%X Educators today need innovative teaching strategies to meet the learning needs of the multigenerational population of perioperative nurses. Emerging technologies, such as YouTube, the world's largest video-sharing web site, can be used as a component of an active learning strategy that can appeal to a broad group of nurses along the novice-to-expert proficiency continuum. Using video clips can be a useful method to engage learners and promote critical thinking, decision making, and creativity. YouTube videos can be used to teach skills or as a platform for discussion. Learners also can create and upload their own videos to educate others.

%X The problem-solving approach to nursing is labeled the "nursing process". It is common to use cases of simulated patients described on paper as teaching materials in order to learn nursing processes. In the present study, we developed a prototype e-learning system for improving the problem solving abilities of nursing students. The teaching materials included the following 8 nursing education categories: basic nursing; adult nursing (chronic and acute); pediatric nursing; mental health and psychiatric nursing; community health nursing (maternal and child, and geriatric); and occupational health nursing.

%X Under-treated pain is a significant problem. Health care institutions are under increasing pressure from patients and accreditation bodies to improve staff training in pain management. Pain assessment, a necessary pre-cursor to good pain management, is a complex multi-step process requiring sophisticated understanding and superior communication skills. This article describes the development and usability testing of an interactive, Internet-deliverable, multimedia tutorial to teach best practice pain assessment. The software platform allowed non-programmers to create multimedia tutorials and included the capability to simulate role-plays. The tutorial was designed to actively engage and respond to the learner and to include skills practice. Twenty-five nurses took the tutorial and rated it positively on a usability questionnaire in terms of ease-of-use and learning method.

%X AIM To introduce faculty to podcasting, giving them opportunities for course integration in nursing. BACKGROUND Faculty represented adult, gerontological, psychiatric, acute, and family health specialties interested in technology integration. METHOD Faculty were invited to submit an abstract describing interest and experience with educational technology and intended use of podcasting. Each faculty received an iPod® and sessions were held updating the required technical skills. Transformational learning was the conceptual framework, and faculty and students were encouraged and tutored in workshops to utilize podcast technology. Faculty launched podcasts on the university's platform, monitored students' responses, and conducted end-of-course evaluations. RESULTS Faculty enthusiastically embraced podcasting's potential. Students' responses were mixed. Many viewed podcasts as extra work and preferred face-to-face class or written assignments. Podcasts were helpful to others, especially during commutes or for reviewing or reinforcing material. Auditory learners also preferred podcasts. CONCLUSION Despite some technical difficulties, responses were positive. Using the theory of transformational learning and allowing students greater flexibility in obtaining knowledge, asynchronously, and at their own pace, proved beneficial.

%X Introduction: El Virtual Classroom (VC) from Murcia University is the official e-learning where teachers and students have various online tools that facilitate the development of teaching and learning. The VC uses SAKAI platform (Apero Foundation). Objective: To evaluate the use of VC in the Palliative Care subject of 2nd course of Grade of Nursing studies from Murcia University. Methods: During the academic year 2014-2015 we used e-learning with a VC for Palliative Care subject. Interactive learning shifts the focus from a passive, teacher-centered model of the past years to one that is active and learner-centered, offering a stronger learning stimulus The tools in the VC were: Teaching guide, calendar, resources, announcements, private messages, chats, exercises, exams online, weblogs, message boards and teleconferencing. Results: Of 205 official students in the Palliative Care subject, 99.5% visited VC. The total number of visit: 13673. In the months near to the final exam (1st July), the visits to the VC were of 3801 in May and 3951 in June. The tool more used was “Resources”: the students can work with educational materials such as lessons, text, graphics, animation, audio, or video to produce engaging content. It contained 193 archives. Of them, 98.4% were downloaded. The VC also has resolved student's doubts with the tool “Virtual tutorial” (100% were resolved). The final satisfaction survey has shown higher levels of learner satisfaction (90%), understanding of concepts, achievement of course objectives, and changes in practice. Students explained that the VC allows learning to be individualized and transforming the role of the teacher (from disseminator to facilitator). Conclusion: The integration of e-learning into education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.

%X The research literature on the use of cinema in nurse education is relatively small. This study evaluates student nurses' learning experiences of a new undergraduate elective module called Madness in the Movies. Ethical approval was granted to conduct the study. Data were collected through an online survey and a social media discussion forum. The anonymous online survey responses were collated via Survey Monkey. Content analysis was conducted on the data from the Facebook discussion threads to understand, interpret and conceptualise the meanings from the data. All study participants agreed that their understanding of mental health issues was enriched, their attitudes and beliefs enhanced and their confidence to talk about mental health concerns increased significantly. This module provides a fruitful approach to encourage critical reflection on mental health issues in a safe environment that closely mirrors authentic practice experiences. The module facilitates the development of students' knowledge, values and attitudes in relation to person-centred mental healthcare.

%X Traditional teaching methods used in medical education couldn't meet the need for keeping pace with up to date information. Present study has conducted in order to compare the effect of lecture and e-learning methods on nursing students' learning outcomes in the context of Iran. A cross-over design was applied. Study sample was consisted of 32 students which were in third semester of nursing bachelor program and were passing Maternal Child nursing course. The first part of the course was taught using lecture method during first four weeks; an e-learning method was the technique used to educate the remained part of the course during the second four weeks. Students' learning outcomes in each method, opinion toward and participation with both educational methods was assessed. No significant difference was found between students exam scores in both methods. Considering students' opinion toward educational methods, no significant difference was found between two methods in general but students reported better "capability" and "independency" in e-learning method while lecture was obtained higher scores in "effectiveness on learning" and "motivation" characteristics. E-learning can be used in teaching some nursing courses. It is recommended to use e-learning method with appropriate interactive strategies and attractive virtual environments to motivate students.

%X Patient simulation has been used to augment the traditional clinical model, but its value is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a theory-driven pediatric simulation curriculum on nursing students' clinical performance. The convenience sample included 116 junior nursing students enrolled in a pediatric course. Using a staggered timing model, students attended simulation instead of clinical for 2 weeks (25%) of an 8-week semester. The students spent the same amount of time in simulation as in clinical (12 hours per week). Student clinical performance was assessed using a Likert-style tool at 2-week intervals by the clinical faculty. Scores of students who attended simulation in the first 2 weeks were compared with students who had not yet attended simulation. Data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis with the mixed model, and covariate effects were considered. A Compound Symmetry covariance model was used to control the correlation between weeks within each subject. Statistical significance was determined at the 5% level. Faculty rated students with patient simulation experience higher than those who had not yet attended simulation (mean ± standard error: 1.74 ± 0.75, P = 0.02). On item-level analysis, therapeutic skills were positively impacted by simulation (P = 0.02). Time in simulation enhanced clinical performance, as simulation students achieved higher scores more quickly than those without simulation and maintained high performance levels. These findings suggest patient simulation is a valuable addition to augment the apprenticeship model.

%X METHODS: The intervention group used an adaptive self-learning e-learning tool developed by the research team (ePULab) for pressure ulcer assessment and treatment. The control group received a traditional on-campus class on the same topic. Pretest and post-test questionnaires were designed to assess the students' ability in pressure ulcer diagnosis and treatment.
RESULTS: The educational intervention based on the use of the ePULab tool produced significantly better learning acquisition results than those obtained by traditional lecture-style classes: the total score improved in the control group from 8·23 (SD 1·23)-11·6 (SD 2·52) after the lecture, whereas in the intervention group, the knowledge score changed from 8·27 (SD 1·39)-15·83 (SD 2·52) (p = 0·01) with the use of ePULab.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show a higher effectiveness of the devised e-learning approach for education on management of pressure ulcers.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our results reveal the suitability of the ePULab e-learning tool as an effective instrument for training on assessment of and treatment for pressure ulcers and its potential impact on clinical decision-making.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of information and communication technologies in the undergraduate students' pressure ulcer training as a learning tool, compared with traditional teaching methods.
BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers constitute one of the great challenges faced by nursing professionals. Currently, pressure ulcer training is based on traditional on-campus teaching, involving lecture-style classes with frequent use of photographs of the wounds. This traditional training has some important weaknesses that can put the efficacy of the training at risk.
DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial was developed including undergraduate nursing students.

%X Background Rheumatology nursing management is a relevant strategic challenge. The recent “EULAR recommendations for the role of the nurse in the management of chronic inflammatory arthritis” indicate specific goals for a wide range of interventions. Thus, an effective educational agenda is urgently needed to support the access to high quality education for nurses. Objectives To determine the response of nurses a web-based e-learning programme. Methods AIR (Assistenza Infermieristica Reumatologica) is an educational website that was created in November 2009 (www.aircommunity.it). It represents the first experience in Italy of a teaching website specifically oriented to rheumatology nurses. The main goal of AIR is to provide useful information on several knowledge domains including the ABC of the rheumatic diseases, counseling, patient education, and risk management. From the November 2011 AIR website also includes an e-learning platform that permits to obtain certified learning credits by a “problem solving” approach. Eight clinical cases highly representative of daily rheumatological practice are included in the project (three cases have already been published). Each case description includes 16 specific questions focused on various clinical nursing problems. To obtain learning credits, all the questions had to be answered. Results The visitors' number of the website increased from 200 (November 2009) to 13225 (January 2012). The registered users are currently 1450. In spite the website is in Italian, a total of 11.775 pages have been visited by navigators from other European countries and 3.893 navigators from United States. In three months a total of 1019 nurses were involved in the e-learning platform of clinical cases. 628 nurses out of 871 passed the test assessment of the first case; 500 out of 606 nurses passed the test assessment of the second case whereas 352 out of 420 nurses passed the test assessment of the third case. Conclusions The results of our preliminary e-learning experience focused on rheumatology nursing are encouraging. The fast increase of visitors over the last three months indicates a strong interest by nurses to the “problem solving” approach.

%X The ability to accurately document undergraduate student nurses' development while in the clinical area is a requirement of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Owing to a number of strategic and pragmatic drivers, the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Southampton has developed and implemented an e-Assessment of Professional Practice (eAoPP). This platform enables the student, mentor and academic staff to access the portfolio from any internet enabled device and has been rolled out in phases over 2 years to more than 5000 students and mentors. The key factors underpinning the success of the project are presented along with an audit and preliminary analysis of support service activity provided during the roll out to 380 students in January 2015 across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Plans for future development, including employability and roll out to other student groups are discussed.

%X This paper discusses the introduction of blended learning strategies, a combination of traditional and online techniques, into the first year of a new preregistration nursing advanced diploma and degree programme at Bournemouth University (UK).During a ten week sociology of health academic unit, in the first term of a three year nursing course, wikis were introduced as a complementary learning technique to traditional lectures and seminars. Wikis, an online application, provided eleven student seminar groups (each divided into 4 online or elearning groups of 6-8 students) with the potential to communicate collaboratively "anytime, anywhere" (JISC, 2010) to discuss a sociology preparation activity for the preceding week. The implementation of this elearning tool was structured through the application of Salmon's five stage model (Salmon, 2002) and evaluated from 69 students' online contributions to wikis as well as questionnaires completed by both a sample of students and academic staff. As well as the many comments made by students the evaluation indicated that 45% of students' responses valued wikis as a communication tool and 33% believed it promoted or allowed the sharing of group views.The evaluation presents and critiques the initial project management using Salmon's five stage model and the engagement of students and academic staff. In particular it begins to show how wikis have the potential to structure academic learning and promote social networking in the crucial first few months of a course. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X A recent point prevalence study completed across 15 Victorian Health Services identified malnutrition as highly prevalent in the inpatient and ambulatory oncology settings. A core recommendation from this study was to develop a resource to increase awareness, understanding and the appropriate management of malnutrition amongst multidisciplinary cancer clinicians. E-learning resources were the selected medium, with the goal to optimise the accessibility, reach and impact. E-learning presents benefits in cost effectiveness; enhanced audience engagement and response; consistency and currency of information; accessibility and flexibility in time, pace and location; monitoring capacity; and opportunity for innovative, interactive, active learning. Focussed, discipline specific cancer malnutrition E-learning packages were developed for medical, allied health, nursing, general practitioners and practice nurse domains to promote awareness, identification, early intervention and management. Through education and enhanced management, patient outcomes are expected to benefit. Development of the packages considered key theories in adult learning given the diverse target audience. Kolb's Experiential Learning theory was consulted and a range of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic information modalities utilised to enhance educational impact on cancer clinicians. Videos, images, maps and charts were utilised throughout to engage visual learners. Auditory learners will benefit from consistent written and verbal information presented by a narrator, clinicians and patients as well as a range of written information as fact-sheets, education resources, clinical tools and a comprehensive literature review. The resource includes a range of interactive activities throughout to engage those who learn kinaesthetically. In many cases, a combination of visual, auditory and kinaesthetic information was presented to optimise the influence of the information provided. This e-learning package is an example of an innovative, interactive, evidence-based health education package. A number of pedagogic strategies and theories have been employed to meet the learning needs of a wide and diverse audience to ultimate enhance patient care and outcomes.

%X High-fidelity patient simulation is becoming an essential component of prelicensure nursing education. A survey was mailed to the boards of nursing in all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to ascertain the use of high-fidelity patient simulators for clinical time in current regulations. Participants were asked if high-fidelity patient simulation could be substituted for clinical time in the regulations and, if so, for what percentage. If not, they were asked whether they gave approval to nursing programs to substitute clinical time with high-fidelity patient simulators and, if so, for what percentage. Finally, the participants were asked whether they felt that the regulations would be changed in the future to allow the use of high-fidelity patient simulators to substitute for clinical time. Five states and Puerto Rico have made regulation changes to allow for such substitution, but only Florida has indicated a percentage of time. Sixteen states currently give approval for simulation substitution, and 17 states may consider regulation changes concerning high-fidelity patient simulation in the future. Such findings have implications for alterations in the prelicensure nursing curriculum that could examine patient safety and quality concerns addressed by the public and leading health and nursing organizations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

%X Modern handheld devices and wireless communications foster new kinds of communication and interaction that can define new approaches to teaching and learning. Mobile learning (m-learning) seeks to use them extensively, exactly in the same way in which e-learning uses personal computers and wired communication technologies. In this new mobile environment, new applications and educational models need to be created and tested to confirm (or reject) their validity and usefulness. In this article, we present a mobile tool aimed at self-assessment, which allows students to test their knowledge at any place and at any time. The degree to which the students' achievement improved is also evaluated, and a survey on the students' opinion of the new tool was also conducted. An experimental group of 20- to 21-year-old nursing students was chosen to test the tool. Results show that this kind of tool improves students' achievement and does not make necessary to introduce substantial changes in current teaching activities and methodology.

%X PURPOSE: An important component of the clinical nurse specialist (CNS) educational program involves anticipatory guidance for students assimilating the CNS role. This article describes a strategy for facilitating this transition through online discussion about CNS practice among students and experienced CNSs. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS: Six students in the final semester of their CNS program and 5 CNSs from across the country used the WebCT platform to participate in an online learning experience. This article outlines the process of structuring an online discussion, soliciting an expert panel, and preparing the participants. Students' concerns and panelists' responses are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Themes that emerged from students' questions to the panelists were certification and title protection; developing a career trajectory, including tips for interviewing and negotiation; and current and future trends in CNS practice. Benefits to participants are described, as well as suggestions for using Web-based discussion in other applications.

%X PURPOSE: Interprofessional education (IPE) is essential for preparing nurse practitioner (NP) students to provide care in a collaborative team environment. The combination of a virtual clinic and video conferencing designed for NP students to practice interprofessional collaboration has not been studied. This study examined students' perceptions of the virtual learning environment which was developed to improve interprofessional competencies.
DATA SOURCES: A survey instrument developed to evaluate interprofessional practice competencies was administered to student participants from eight disciplines (n = 71) following eight video conference discussions of an elderly patient presentation in a virtual clinic.
CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of responses was significantly associated with interprofessional competency domain (p = .002). The distribution of responses was also significantly associated with discipline (p < .001). Participants rated the value of this activity positively.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A virtual clinic and video conferencing was an acceptable learning platform for students, which can be used to simplify IPE logistics. The roles and responsibility competency domain is perhaps the hardest for novices to grasp. Teaching meeting facilitation is a necessary part of IPE for NP students to be able to use these skills in the future.

%X The use of high-fidelity human patient simulators (HPS) have been embraced by nursing education programs in the development of immersive clinical simulations despite the lack of research into a pedagogy or educational philosophy appropriate to guide this technology-based learning tool. In this article, we explore this approach to clinical teaching through a critical examination of the application of behaviorist and constructivist pedagogy to high-fidelity scenario-based simulation sessions. Practical guidelines for developing simulation-based learning sessions that reflect both philosophical paradigms are provided. Consideration is also given to societal trends such as the digital revolution and the incoming millennial generation who represent the aptitude of the modern nursing student to utilize high-fidelity realistic and immersive simulation. Depending on the desired goal of simulator utilization, the nurse educator may want to draw on constructivism or behaviorism or a blend of both educational philosophies to best meet the needs of the adult learner. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The use of the high-fidelity human patient simulator (HPS)-based clinical scenario in undergraduate nursing education is a powerful learning tool, well suited to modern nursing students' preference for immersive construction of knowledge through the provision of contextually rich reality-based practice and social discourse. The purpose of this study was to explore the social-psychological processes that occur within HPS-based clinical scenarios. Grounded theory method was used to study students and faculty sampled from a Western Canadian baccalaureate nursing program. The process of leveled coding generated a substantive theory that has the potential to enable educators to empower students through the use of fading support, a twofold process composed of adaptive scaffolding and dynamic assessment that challenges students to realistically self-regulate and transform their frame of reference for nursing practice, while limiting the threats that traditional HPS-based curriculum can impose. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X Nurse educators are charged with the responsibility of empowering novice nurses to become autonomous thinkers with the capacity to cope with the many challenges of modern day practice. Human patient simulation is a powerful technology-based educational tool ideally suited for the application of emancipatory pedagogies that aid in the transformation of individual meaning schemes. Transformative learning theory provides educators with the tools to empower students to challenge their preconceived beliefs, assumptions, and values and socialize them appropriately to thrive in modern day clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to critically analyze the role of clinical scenarios using human patient simulation to promote transformative learning events in undergraduate nursing education. The authors focus on the role of debriefing in the promotion of the critical reflection and social discourse that is integral to the learning process and the implementation of scenarios that provide students with disorientating dilemmas for perspective transformation. © SLACK incorporated.

%X Human patient simulation provides students with experiences and skills they might not otherwise encounter in a clinical rotation. It also offers an experience during which the time is suspended, thus affording students time to think critically, make decisions, and act, as opposed to the fast-paced hospital environment where students may have neither a clear picture of the situation nor adequate time to act. This article presents the design of a simulation center within a school of nursing along with several areas of considerations for successful implementation of the laboratory. A simulation scenario focusing on the acute coronary syndrome used during a final semester critical care nursing course is described and student evaluation of the experience analyzed. The evaluation includes student assessment of the simulation process for the development of necessary patient care skills and the ability to test decision-making and critical thinking skills. The experience with the initial integration of simulation into the nursing curriculum is discussed, inclusive of opportunities for improvement. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

%X Technology in education is moving quickly in terms of the hardware and software applications available, but also due to the expectations of an increasingly digitally competent student population. Academics have to rethink their pedagogy in relation to these changes. Nurse educators, in particular, must face the challenge of effectively integrating technology into what is essentially a hands-on, people-centred profession. To date, the factors most commonly cited as barriers to the adoption of e-learning by academics have focused on explicit and tangible ('hard') issues. Less frequently mentioned are the implicit and tacit ('soft') factors which are harder to identify. This article describes a pilot study using Q-methodology to explore the limitations of commonly used research methods in identifying how these hard and soft issues are prioritised by individuals, through the voices of nurse educators.

%X Aims: To report a study undertaken to explore the underlying factors influencing e-learning adoption in nurse education. Background: Despite e-learning's high profile it has not been readily integrated into teaching practice in nurse education. Previous research has identified generic, cross-disciplinary factors but has left out 'soft' factors. Design: The study adopted an exploratory descriptive design. Methods: Q-methodology was used to explore e-learning adoption in a Division of Nursing located in an institution of Higher Education in the UK. Between September-December 2009, 38 participants were recruited to participate in Q-sorts and post-sort interviews. The Q-sort data were factor analysed and the interviews were coded to their respective factors to develop in-depth narratives. Findings: Four factors were identified: 'E-learning advocates' saw e-learning's potential to improve nurse education and prepare future nurses for their evolving role; the 'Humanists' had avoided e-learning because they valued human interaction; the 'Sceptics' doubted that technology could improve learning outcomes; and the 'Pragmatics,' only used e-learning as a tool to post lecture notes online to supplement what they covered in class. Conclusion: The findings point to the variety of responses existing among nurse academics faced with integrating e-learning into their teaching. Moving beyond the binary labels commonly attributed to those considered either 'early adopters' or 'laggards,' the findings contribute to the literature by revealing a wider breadth of views and responses towards technology. Acknowledging these views can inform future e-learning strategies and lead to improvement in e-learning use in nurse education. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X E-learning will play an important role in the training portfolio of students in higher and vocational education. Within the LEONARDO-DA-VINCI action programme transnational pilot projects were funded by the European Union, which aimed to improve the usage and quality of e-learning tools in education and professional training. The overall aim of the LEONARDO-DA-VINCI pilot project " e-learning-assistant" was to create new didactical and technical e-learning tools for Europe-wide use in nursing education. Based on a new situation-oriented learning approach, nursing teachers enrolled in the project were instructed to adapt, develop and implement e- and blended learning units. According to the training contents nursing modules were developed by teachers from partner institutions, implemented in the project centers and evaluated by students. The user-package " e-learning-assistant" as a product of the project includes two teacher training units, the authoring tool " synapse" to create situation-based e-learning units, a student's learning platform containing blended learning modules in nursing and an open sourced web-based communication centre. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

%X Objectives 1. Describe the benefits, limitations, and status of interdisciplinary palliative education in the current healthcare education environment and how such education could advance and improve interdisciplinary practice. 2. Describe innovative teaching methods, including virtual reality approaches, and their added value in providing a practical and transportable interdisciplinary palliative care education. 3. Discuss the lessons learned in the early years of developing a mandatory, integrated, interdisciplinary palliative care curriculum across the disciplines of medicine, nursing, social work, and pastoral care. Background. Interdisciplinary practice is core to palliative care, yet students of the healthcare professions are rarely prepared to practice in interdisciplinary teams. The National Cancer Institute funded the University of Louisville to develop, implement, and test a novel, mandatory, and interdisciplinary palliative care curriculum for medical, nursing, social work, and chaplaincy students. This abstract reports on the initial work, progress, and lessons from educators designing and implementing this innovative curriculum. Case Description. The council began work in the fall of 2010. Led by nine learning objectives, members were assigned to four subgroups based on major learning activities: didactics, clinical rotations, clinical vignettes, and standardized patient and family scenariosdall with a focus on interdisciplinary learning and creative group learning experiences. Building on previous efforts in palliative education (ELNEC, EPEC-O, and the ACE Project), 14 didactic modules, to be taught online using interactive technology, were designed. Virtual reality and avatar experiences were evaluated. Community partnerships were developed to design interdisciplinary clinical experiences for learners. Interdisciplinary clinical vignettes (longitudinal case studies) were developed to teach an interdisciplinary perspective in addressing key challenges. Standardized patient and family scenarios were written to address complex and challenging clinical issues. Each learning activity focused on meeting specific learning Objectives, developing creative and novel solutions, and addressing complex/restrictive curricular structures of each discipline, practical implementation, sustainability, and portability. Conclusion. While the value seems clear, the challenges and obstacles can appear overwhelming when attempting to involve learners from four different schools and disciplines, all having different academic schedules and discipline specific learning demands and unique cultures. But interdisciplinary education can be accomplished if educators are willing to be flexible, creative, and persistent. This case study of one educational institution developing such a curriculum can serve as amodel for others hoping to prepare students for interdisciplinary palliative care.

%X Background: Emergency department (ED) blood samples have a higher rate of hemolysis (6%-30%) than the 2% benchmark established by ASCP. Hemolyzed specimens may require re-drawing and re-testing, resulting in delays in treatment, delays clinical decision making, prolonged ED length of stay, and patient dissatisfaction. While the reasons for high hemolysis rates are multifactorial, they are typically caused during the pre-analytic phase of the testing process. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an education initiative aimed towards optimization of a set of preanalytic factors on hemolysis rates in ED blood samples. Methods: This was a prospective interventional study in an urban tertiary care ED with annual volume of approximately 65,000 visits. Utilizing the Sunquest lab data platform, we evaluated all potassium lab draws during two independent periods. The historical control period represented lab draws between 8/1/14-8/23/14 and the comparative period represented draws between 8/1/15-8/23/15, after a predetermined level 85% completion rate of the online education module. The draws in 2015 followed an online education initiative given to nurses and medics in the ED to inform them of best practices in reducing hemolysis including the following: straight stick use, use of antecubital vein for IV lab draws, use of large gauge needles and tourniquet time less than 60 seconds.. We compared the overall frequency of hemolysis using Chi-square tests. Results: The overall hemolysis rate during the control period was 11.57% (259/2238 samples). Following the intervention, hemolysis rates were significantly lower 9.68%; (221/2283, p=0.04). Hemolysis rates with comment and gross hemolysis rates were also less frequent but neither was statistically significant. Conclusion: An online educational effort to instruct frontline staff on best practices had a significant impact on hemolysis rates. Further evaluation of the long-term effects and the specific content that was effective may be valuable in improving this practice in the ED.

%X BACKGROUND: With the proliferation of portable digital technology, mobile learning is becoming increasingly popular in nursing education and practice. Most of the research in this field has been concentrated on small-scale projects in high income countries. Very little is known about the ways in which nurses and midwives use mobile technology in remote and resource poor areas in informal learning contexts in low and middle income countries.
OBJECTIVES: To address this gap, this study investigates whether nurses use mobile phones as effective educational tools in marginalized and remote areas, and if so, how and why.
SETTING AND METHODS: In rural South Africa, 16 nurses who attended an advanced midwifery education program, facilitators and clinical managers were interviewed about their use of digital mobile technology for learning. Techniques of qualitative content analysis were used to examine the data.
RESULTS: Several rich "organically-grown", learning practices were identified: mobile phone usage facilitated (1) authentic problem solving; (2) reflective practice; (3) emotional support and belongingness; (4) the realization of unpredictable teaching situations; and (5) life-long learning.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that mobile phones, and the convergence of mobile phones and social media, in particular, change learning environments. In addition, these tools are suitable to connect learners and learning distributed in marginalized areas. Finally, a few suggestions are made about how these insights from informal settings can inform the development of more systematic mobile learning formats.

%X This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of an eLearning program intended to provide incoming nursing students with the basic knowledge, skills and abilities needed to succeed in graduate-level, online coursework. Using Mayer's principles (2008) for the effective design of multimedia instruction, an open-access, self-directed, online program was developed. The Graduate School Boot Camp includes five online modules focused on learning strategies and time management, academic writing, technology, research, and library skills. To motivate and engage learners, the program integrates a fun, graphical sports theme with audiovisual presentations, examples, demonstrations and practice exercises. Learners begin with a self-assessment based on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire or MSLQ (Pintrich et al., 1993). To assess change in knowledge levels before and after completing the program, learners take a pre-test and post-test. Preliminary findings indicate that the students found the information relevant and useful. They enjoyed the self-paced, multimedia format, and liked the option to return to specific content later. This innovative program offers a way to prepare students proactively, and may prove useful in identifying students at risk and connecting them with the appropriate resources to facilitate successful program completion.

%X Human Patient Simulators (HPS), electronically controlled mannequins as patient models, are increasingly being used in nursing education. However, no studies have validated the influence of systematic practice with HPS on clinical performance of nursing students. This pilot study attempted to identify the nursing clinical practice parameters influenced by HPS by evaluating the clinical performance of 12 senior second degree BSN students in five categories: safety, basic assessment skills, prioritization, problem-focused assessment, ensuing interventions, delegation and communication in a complex two-patient, simulated assignment. Students who practiced with the HPS in addition to their usual clinical training had significantly higher scores than the control group (usual clinical training alone) on Patient Identification (a subcategory of the safety category; p = 0.001), and on Assessing Vital Signs (a subcategory of the basic assessment category; p = 0.009). The control and intervention groups' performances were similar in every other category. Replication of this pilot with a larger sample is recommended.

%X The 21st century has ushered in many new trends and tools in education. A myriad of articles, Web sites, and books offer enticing possibilities that Web 2.0 tools may increase learner engagement, improve interactivity, and allow tailoring of education to the learner. Classroom training is trending downward, and Web-based training is on the rise. But is the Internet really the answer to educators' prayers, or is it just another flash in the pan? The sheer number of technological tools and delivery methods available can be mind-boggling. This article reviews some of the basic terminology and tools that are readily available for use in delivering education via the Internet. Benefits and barriers associated with e-learning are discussed from the evidence found in nursing and education literature and the personal experiences of a nurse educator in a multihospital system. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

%X Aim and objective. To explore undergraduate nursing students' experiences of High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation. Background. Use of simulation as an educational tool is rapidly gaining popularity. Simulation provides a safe learning environment and helps overcome difficulties securing sufficient clinical placements. However, several limitations have been identified with this approach, particularly in relation to cost and authenticity. Design. Exploratory qualitative methodology informed the development of knowledge in this under-researched area. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with 21 nursing students and first year graduates. Participants had experienced High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation during the program. This involved their lecturer simulating a patient by adopting mannerisms and behaviours of a person, based on a predeveloped character and using masks and appropriate clothing to establish the visual image of a simulated patient. Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify main areas of interest to participants. Results. Two main themes are reported in this paper: 'realism of the character' and 'skills of the teacher'. Characters presented to students were viewed as realistic which enabled participants to engage with the character and take the process seriously. Knowledge and skill of the teacher was used to direct student learning experience and maximise learning benefits to be gained. Conclusion. High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation was perceived by student participants as a highly effective teaching tool. Participants found the experience positive and believe it impacted on the quality of learning experiences. Relevance to clinical practice. Clinical experience is necessary for the development of safe and competent registered nurses. Simulation has been acknowledged as a useful adjunct to clinical experience, particularly when placements are limited. High Fidelity Patient Silicone Simulation may be used to promote realism, enhance student learning and contribute to an increase in clinical competence and confidence in nursing students. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

%X Scheduling interprofessional team-based activities for health sciences students who are geographically dispersed, with divergent and often competing schedules, can be challenging. The use of Web-based technologies such as 3-dimensional (3D) virtual learning environments in interprofessional education is a relatively new phenomenon, which offers promise in helping students come together in online teams when face-to-face encounters are not possible. The purpose of this article is to present the experience of a nurse-midwifery education program in a Southeastern US university in delivering Web-based interprofessional education for nurse-midwifery and third-year medical students utilizing the Virtual Community Clinic Learning Environment (VCCLE). The VCCLE is a 3D, Web-based, asynchronous, immersive clinic environment into which students enter to meet and interact with instructor-controlled virtual patient and virtual preceptor avatars and then move through a classic diagnostic sequence in arriving at a plan of care for women throughout the lifespan. By participating in the problem-based management of virtual patients within the VCCLE, students learn both clinical competencies and competencies for interprofessional collaborative practice, as described by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice. This article is part of a special series of articles that address midwifery innovations in clinical practice, education, interprofessional collaboration, health policy, and global health.

We describe a unique clinical teaching model implemented at the New York University College of Nursing. The new model currently being evaluated shifts from the traditional clinical education model, in which all clinical education is in a hospital or agency setting, to a model that substitutes highfidelity human patient simulation for up to half of the clinical education experience.

%X To meet the demands required for safe and effective care, nurses must be able to integrate theoretical knowledge with clinical practice (Kohen and Lehman, 2008; Polit and Beck, 2008; Shirey, 2006). This should include the ability to adapt research in response to changing clinical environments and the changing needs of service users. It is through reflective practice that students develop their clinical reasoning and evaluation skills to engage in this process.This paper aims to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a project designed to provide a structural approach to the recognition and resolution of clinical, theoretical and ethical dilemmas identified by 3rd year undergraduate mental health nursing students. This is the first paper to describe the iterative process of developing a 'blended' learning model which provides students with an opportunity to experience the process of supervision and to become more proficient in using information technology to develop and maintain their clinical skills.Three cohorts of student nurses were exposed to various combinations of face to face group supervision and a virtual learning environment (VLE) in order to apply their knowledge of good practice guidelines and evidenced-based practice to identified clinical issues. A formal qualitative evaluation using independently facilitated focus groups was conducted with each student cohort and thematically analysed (Miles & Huberman, 1994). The themes that emerged were: relevance to practice; facilitation of independent learning; and the discussion of clinical issues.The results of this study show that 'blending' face-to-face groups with an e-learning component was the most acceptable and effective form of delivery which met the needs of students' varied learning styles. Additionally, students reported that they were more aware of the importance of clinical supervision and of their role as supervisees. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

%X High-fidelity simulation is a useful mechanism to aid progression, development and skill acquisition in nurse education. However, nurse lecturers are daunted by sophisticated simulation technology. This paper presents a new method of introducing human patient simulation to students and educators, whilst seeking to demystify the roles, responsibilities and underpinning pedagogy. The analogy of simulation as theatre outlines the concepts of the theatre and stage (simulation laboratory); the play itself (Simulated Clinical Experience, SCE); the actors (nursing students); audience (peer review panel); director (session facilitator); and the production team (technical coordinators). Performing in front of people in a safe environment, repeated practice and taking on a new role teaches students to act, think and be like a nurse. This in turn supports student learning and enhances self confidence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

%X The United States population is undergoing a major demographic shift, by the year 2050, it is predicted that minority populations will constitute half of the general population. This evolving population change is significant due to the overwhelming burden of disease that minorities face in the nation. Cultural competence training is currently being used to prepare practitioners to provide care to a diverse population in an effort to eliminate health disparities. With the increasing demands of the nursing curriculum and the limited time frame to prepare competent clinicians, the search continues for innovative strategies that will produce culturally competent providers. Patient simulation is a technique that replicates real-world scenarios in a controlled and nonthreatening environment. However, despite the legal and moral obligations that nurses have to provide culturally competent care, a lack of evidence exists regarding how to properly integrate simulation methods for cultural competence training into the nursing curriculum. In the nursing curriculum, patient simulation has been used mainly to teach the biomedical aspects of care with less focus on the psychological, cultural, and environmental context. The potential exists for the use of high-fidelity patient simulation as an effective teaching strategy for cultural competence training.

%X The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in measures of pretest and posttest self-efficacy following simulation-based training and to compare differences in self-efficacy between nursing students exposed to medium- or high-fidelity patient simulations. This study used a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. A convenience sample of 163 second-year nursing students was assigned to either the high-fidelity patient simulation group (n = 28) or medium-fidelity simulation group (n = 135). Resuscitation-specific self-efficacy was measured at pretest and posttest. The overall mean self-efficacy score was higher at posttest compared with pretest in both the high-fidelity group (t = 9.327, P < .001) and medium-fidelity group (t = 6.568, P < .001). Nursing students exposed to high-fidelity patient simulation reported significantly higher scores on a debriefing and recording subscale (t = 5.578, P < .001), responding and rescuing subscale (t = 5.811, P < .001), reporting subscale (t = 3.441, P = .001), and overall scale score (t = 4.737, P < .001) compared with the medium-fidelity simulation group. Simulation-based training has a positive impact on improving self-efficacy. Additional high-fidelity simulation is more effective than medium-fidelity simulation only in improving nursing students' self-efficacy. There is a need to boost the self-efficacy of the students through mastery experiences in their learning curriculum.

%X Recent research suggests that simulation education can effectively improve nursing students' practical competence and can enhance educational outcomes. But very few studies have identified the relationships between pre-course simulation and course satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pre-course simulations and other advanced learning modalities (i.e. pre-course e-learning, observation, and clinical placement skill performance) predicted students' satisfaction with an emergency nursing clinical course. Second-year Korean nursing students (N = 284) participated in an integrated clinical course consisting of self-directed pre-course e-learning, a 2-hour pre-course simulation, and an 80-hour emergency room clinical placement with observation. Multiple regression analyses found that pre-course simulation, clinical placement skill performance, observation during the clinical placement, and pre-course e-learning accounted for 47.2% of the variance in course satisfaction. Notably, pre-course simulation made the largest contribution to course satisfaction, accounting for 29.1% of the variance. Pre-course simulation, skill performance, observation, and pre-course e-learning all significantly influenced learner satisfaction. Findings suggest that integrating simulation into the clinical curriculum may enhance clinical course satisfaction.

%X Introduction: Following the implementation of the London Stroke Strategy with concentration of care in 8 hyperacute stroke units (HASUs), HASU-specific training to support the significant increase in medical and nursing staff was needed. Simulation training provides an education platform for health care professionals to become immersed in realistic scenarios where outcome is dependent upon technical and non-technical skills. Method: A standardised, curriculum-mapped, high-fidelity, simulationtraining programme was developed across 4 HASUs. Learning outcomes included clinical (acute stroke assessment/management) and non-clinical skills (including time management/decision-making/teamwork). A mixed-methods evaluation approach was used to collect data from participants before, during and atmultiple time intervals after training and to capture differences between HASU practice and implementation of the programme and staff with different roles and experience. Results: Over a 2 year period, 152 HASU staff (70 medical; 82 nursing) participated. Quantitative analysis showed an increase in perceived selfefficacy among all candidates in the domains associated with the intended learning outcomes (p < 0.001); more so in junior compared with senior clinicians. Qualitative analysis showed nurses to find the training more relevant to clinical situations than doctors, who reported simulation to be worthwhile but not as immediately relevant. Both doctors and nurses were less able to recall and associate the learning activities with clinical practice over time. Conclusion: Simulation training may be effective in helping achieve HASU-specific learning outcomes. This project demonstrates that carefully designed simulation programmes, which are congruent with clinical practice, can provide valuable training opportunities that support patient care.

%X Nurse practitioners (NPs) have an increasingly important role in health care provision in the United States. However, most nurses report that they receive little or no clinical training in the area of developmental disabilities. A core development team consisting of NP faculty members from three universities, one physician assistant faculty member, the parents of children with developmental disabilities, and educational specialists developed two multimedia interactive pediatric instructional modules in CD-ROM format: one involving a child with Down syndrome and the other, an infant born at 26 weeks gestation. Participants were required to make decisions about proper clinical interaction throughout the cases. The modules on CD were piloted with NP students at three universities. Effectiveness study results demonstrated significant gains in both knowledge and comfort level regarding the care of patients with developmental disabilities.

%X OBJECTIVES: Describe the use of two massive open online courses designed to provide education on patient safety. Review follow-up evaluation data from the courses. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT: Neither the planners nor the authors have any conflicts of interest to disclose.
BACKGROUND: The Nursing School of the University of Cantabria conducted a training session on patient safety through two massive open online courses (MOOCs) aimed at the general population and especially Spanish-speaking health professionals. This study aimed to analyze the profile of health professionals who have completed the courses, their degree of satisfaction, and the percentage of completion.
METHOD: In this retrospective and observational study, two MOOCs on clinical safety were created through an online platform (MiríadaX). Quantitative analysis of the profile of health professionals, their degree of satisfaction, and the percentage of completion was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 12,400 students were enrolled, and the average completion rate was 32%. The profile of the average student was female, 37 years old, college educated, a nurse in a hospital, and interested in the course because it may be useful for performing her work. Fifty-five percent of students were very satisfied with the course.
CONCLUSION: MOOCs are considered to be effective and easily accessible, with quality content for professional continuing education that encourages interdisciplinary work and meeting professionals from around the world.

%X The current study compared the CathSim virtual reality simulator with simulated limbs for phlebotomy training. In the first experiment, medical students completed two 1-hour training sessions using 1 of the 2 methods. Afterward, the students' performance was assessed with both simulated limbs and genuine patients. The results showed that students trained with the simulated limbs achieved higher scores on both the posttest and the field test with actual patients than those trained on the CathSim system. In the second study, graduate students practiced with the CathSim system for 5 hours. The results showed a significant improvement in scores from pretest to posttest for these students. However, even after extended practice, their final scores did not differ from those of the medical students in the first experiment. Critical differences in design characteristics between the 2 systems may explain these findings. Although the authors observed a clear advantage for simulated limbs over the CathSim system, neither system faithfully represents all of steps needed to perform the procedure. Thus, training decisions may require that the unique advantages afforded by each system be considered. © Copyright 2006 by the Intravenous Nurses Society.

%X Accumulating evidence suggests human patient simulation is an effective instructional technique. Simulated clinical experiences may be a reasonable substitute for direct care experiences. Educators and regulators need to know what mix of simulation and direct care promotes learning and how these experiences can be designed to help nursing students achieve essential outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to identify a model to promote development of clinical judgment among beginning nursing students. Principles related to types of learning and practice (blocked by type or interleaved) were used in exploring simulation and direct care design schema. Using a 50% interleaved simulation design schema, robust clinical judgment scores and positive perceptions of learning were identified among beginning students participating in a basic nursing concepts and skills course. Further study is warranted to determine whether this schema is effective in other nursing courses or with novice-level students from diverse health care disciplines. © SLACK Incorporated.

%X As technological advances continue to expand connectivity and communication, the number of patients and nurses engaging in social media increases. Nurses play a significant role in identification, interpretation, and transmission of knowledge and information within healthcare. Social media is a platform that can assist nursing faculty in helping students to gain greater understanding of and/or skills in professional communication; health policy; patient privacy and ethics; and writing competencies. Although there are barriers to integration of social media within nursing education, there are quality resources available to assist faculty to integrate social media as a viable pedagogical method. This article discusses the background and significance of social media tools as pedagogy, and provides a brief review of literature. To assist nurse educators who may be using or considering social media tools, the article offers selected examples of sound and pedagogically functional use in course and program applications; consideration of privacy concerns and advantages and disadvantages; and tips for success.

%X Human patient simulation in nursing education has become an accepted and expected form of pedagogy. Research on the use of human patient simulation to evaluate student performance, however, is still at an early stage. The vast majority of these sources report the unit of analysis as the nurse-patient dyad (one nurse-one patient) situated in an infrequently occurring, high-risk, or costly event such as a code blue, and the literature reveals little evidence on the efficacy of the use of simulation for the care of multiple patients. The teaching innovation, discussed herein, involving a simulation, used a leadership scenario of a routine day in an acute-care hospital unit. The aim of the project was to provide a high-fidelity simulation of the competing demands on a nurse's time and attention while caring for multiple patients. Working as a team, using principles of prioritization, delegation, scope of practice, and communication, senior baccalaureate nursing students assumed the various roles of interdisciplinary team members as they moved through staged sequences of changing patient and unit conditions. This was followed by debriefing session that prompted the students to identify their errors in judgment, including sending the wrong patient to the operating room, failing to rescue a patient, and failing to delegate critical tasks to other nursing team members.

%X The Hampton University School of Nursing has implemented a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Distance Education Program that utilizes the Blackboard Learning System, which was designed to transform the Internet into a powerful environment for the educational experience. The Interne, however, may be a new learning environment for many nurses seeking a graduate degree. The Blackboard platform allows for synchronous, real-time activities such as chat rooms, and asynchronous, delayed, activities such as discussion boards and digital drop boxes that can be used for student-to-instructor and instructor-to-student document transfer. This article focuses on the skills and challenges of navigating a course on the Internet using Blackboard. Recommendations for improving the teaching-learning process using a Web-based environment are included.

%X Aims To develop and pilot a reproducible curriculum for nurses with limited or no sexual and reproductive health care (SRH) experience to become competent dual-trained practitioners. The model used supernumerary training posts and clinical training and assessment adapted from that used to train doctors for the Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare in the UK. Background There is currently no standard SRH nurse training in the UK. Nurses undertake various university-based qualifications supported by clinical sessions, and employers can be reluctant to sponsor these because of the cost and the time required. Methods Two nurses were employed on a 6-month programme consisting of five parts: (1) the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) e-learning programme, in conjunction with e-Learning for Healthcare; (2) the FSRH 'Course of 5'; (3) structured clinical training; (4) visits to other relevant services; and (5) clinical supervision and mentoring. Assessment was by a portfolio of evidence; signed competences; reflections from clinical sessions; and outcomes of visits to services. The project was evaluated by means of questionnaires and interviews with trainees and staff. Conclusions The project demonstrated that by using a model similar to that used for basic SRH medical training it is possible to train nurses in core holistic SRH care within the workplace. Many SRH services are reporting severe difficulties in the recruitment of nurses trained in SRH, and this practice-based training would allow services and providers to invest in training to build up the workforce they require.

%X Objective: The project aimed to develop and pilot a curriculum for nurse training based on the model used to train doctors in the UK for the Diploma of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (DFSRH). This covers routine contraception, early pregnancy assessment and referral, and STI diagnosis and management in men and women. There is currently no standardised SRH nurse training in the UK and nurses undertake a university- based qualification supported by clinical sessions which employers are reluctant to sponsor because of the cost and time required. Many SRH services are reporting severe difficulties in the recruitment of nurses trained in SRH. The project aimed to demonstrate that services can employ nurses with limited SRH skills in supernumerary 'training posts'and support them to gain the required skills to work independently providing Level 1 holistic SRH care. Design and methods: The curriculum was agreed, and a programme of visits and clinical placements planned. Two nurses with limited sexual health experience were employed into a six-month training post at the Margaret Pyke and Mortimer Market Centres in London, which together are one of the largest providers of SRH services in the UK. Each nurse was allocated two Nurse Specialists as clinical assessors, one for Genito-Urinary Medicine and one for Contraception competences. In addition, a Nurse Specialist acted as a mentor for the theoretical part of the programme and as an external reviewer for progress and evaluation of the project. A steering group of nurses and doctors oversaw the project. The training programme consisted of five parts; (i) The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) e-learning programme, eSRH; (ii) The FSRH course of Five; (iii) Structured clinical training; (iv) Visits to other relevant services; and (v) Clinical supervision and mentoring. Assessment was by a portfolio of evidence demonstrating; successful completion of the e-learning and course of five; signed competences; reflections from clinical sessions and objectives and outcomes of visits to services. Results: Both nurses successfully completed the programme within the six-month time frame and impressed colleagues with their competence and confidence as valuable members of the SRH team. The programme was highly evaluated and both have been employed within the service as integrated SRH nurses. Conclusions: The project showed that in using a model similar to that used for SRH medical training it is possible to train nurses in holistic SRH care within the workplace.

%X The aim of this study was to describe registered nurses' experiences with an e-learning education program (ELEP) conducted at a 776-bed teaching medical center in Taipei. The study was completed in three stages: planning, implementation, and evaluation. Nurses who were registered were randomly assigned either to the ELEP or traditional in-classroom program (TICP). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Forty-two nurses participated (22 in the ELEP and 20 in the TICP). Scores for participants were all > 70 points (out of 100) for both programs. Of the five courses, only teaching and learning and communication showed significant statistical difference between the two groups (p = .001). Nearly all participants (97.6%) felt satisfied with their program (both ELEP and TICP). All nurses passed the nursing care skill tests. Findings should help guide efforts to popularize e-learning education in Taiwan and help create alternative learning methods for future continuing nursing education programs.

Methods: Nurses of the experimental group (n=67) and control group (n=56) attended the training courses for consolidating and developing core competence of psychiatric nurses from June to October, 2013.The Nursing Department of Mental Health Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine cooperated with Department of Nursing Science of University of Turku, Finland to provide the e-learning courses. Nurses of the experimental group attended five-month training courses in addition to regular hospital nursing training. Competency Inventory for Registered Nurse (CIRN) was adopted to evaluate the core competence of nurses before and after training. Results: The differences of the overall score of CIRN and values of factors (except professional development) of the experimental group before and after training were statistically significant (P<0.01). The differences of the overall score of CIRN and values of factors (except clinical nursing and professional development) between the experimental group and control group after training were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: The e-learning based international cooperative training has good effects on developing the core competence of psychiatric nurses and facilitates international cooperation and communication of psychiatric nursing continuing education.

%X BACKGROUND: The use of simulations has been considered as opportunities for students to enhance their critical thinking (CT), but previous studies were limited because they did not provide in-depth information on the working dynamics of simulation or on the effects of the number of simulation exposures on CT.
OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of an integrated pediatric nursing simulation used in a nursing practicum on students' CT abilities and identified the effects of differing numbers of simulation exposures on CT in a multi-site environment.
DESIGN: The study used a multi-site, pre-test, post-test design.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A total of 237 nursing students at three universities enrolled in a pediatric practicum participated in this study from February to December 2013.
METHODS: All three schools used the same simulation courseware, including the same simulation scenarios, evaluation tools, and simulation equipment. The courseware incorporated high-fidelity simulators and standardized patients. Students at school A completed one simulation session, whereas students at schools B and C completed two and three simulation sessions, respectively. Yoon's Critical Thinking Disposition tool (2008) was used to measure students' CT abilities.
RESULTS: The gains in students' CT scores varied according to their numbers of exposures to the simulation courseware. With a single exposure, there were no statistically significant gains in CT, whereas three exposures to the courseware produced significant gains in CT. In seven subcategories of critical thinking, three exposures to the simulation courseware produced CT gains in the prudence and intellectual eagerness subcategories, and the overall simulation experience produced CT gains in the prudence, systematicity, healthy skepticism, and intellectual eagerness subcategories.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation courseware may produce positive learning outcomes for prudence in nursing education. In addition, the findings from the multi-site comparative study may contribute to greater understanding of how patient simulation experiences impact students' CT abilities.

%X UNLABELLED: Human patient simulation (HPS) is becoming a popular teaching method in nursing education globally and is believed to enhance both knowledge and critical thinking.
OBJECTIVE: While there is evidence that HPS improves knowledge, there is no objective nursing data to support HPS impact on critical thinking. Therefore, we studied knowledge and critical thinking before and after HPS in prelicensure nursing students and attempted to identify the predictors of higher critical thinking scores.
METHODS: Using a one-group, quasi-experimental, pre-test post-test design, 154 prelicensure nursing students (age 25.7± 6.7; gender=87.7% female) from 3 schools were studied at the same point in their curriculum using a high-fidelity simulation. Pre- and post-HPS assessments of knowledge, critical thinking, and self-efficacy were done as well as assessments for demographics and learning style.
RESULTS: There was a mean improvement in knowledge scores of 6.5 points (P<0.001), showing evidence of learning. However, there was no statistically significant change in the critical thinking scores. A logistic regression with 10 covariates revealed three variables to be predictors of higher critical thinking scores: greater "age" (P=0.01), baseline "knowledge" (P=0.04) and a low self-efficacy score ("not at all confident") in "baseline self-efficacy in managing a patient's fluid levels" (P=.05).
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that gains in knowledge with HPS do not equate to changes in critical thinking. It does expose the variables of older age, higher baseline knowledge and low self-efficacy in "managing a patient's fluid levels" as being predictive of higher critical thinking ability. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of repeated or sequential simulations (dosing) and timing after the HPS experience on critical thinking gains.

%X INTRODUCTION: Human patient simulation (HPS) is a widely used method of teaching in nursing education. While it is believed that a student's learning style impacts knowledge gains in HPS, there is little evidence to support this. This study sought to determine the impact of learning style on knowledge gains after a heart failure (HF) simulation experience in pre-licensure nursing students.
METHODS: A convenience sample of four cohorts of prelicensure nursing students (n=161) were recruited from three Baccalaureate Schools of Nursing at the same point in their curriculum (age 25.7±6.6 years; gender=85.5% female) and participated in HPS using a HF simulation on a high-fidelity manikin. Learning style was assessed by the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and pre- and post-HPS knowledge measured by parallel, validated, knowledge tests. The LSI identifies 4 learning styles, (Assimilating Diverging, Accommodating, and Converging). In some cases, learners present a balanced learning profile-an emphasis of all four equally. Statistical analysis consisted of t-tests and ANOVA.
RESULTS: HF knowledge scores post-HPS compared to pre-HPS scores revealed a mean improvement of 7 points (p<0.001) showing evidence of learning. Within group score increases between the pre-test and post-test were seen for the Assimilating (66.68±20.87 to 83.35±12.59; p=0.07), Diverging (61.95±11.08 to 69.86±12.33; p<0.01) and balanced profiles (64.4±12.45 to 71.8±10.14; p<0.01), but not for Converging or Accommodating profiles (73% of sample). Post-hoc paired t-tests revealed a large effect size for the Assimilators (0.91) and moderate effect sizes for both the Divergers and balanced profiles (0.67 and 0.65, respectively).
CONCLUSION: These findings confirm that knowledge gains occur with HPS and provide evidence that HPS is an effective teaching methodology for nursing students identifying with most types of learning styles.

%X The Chief Nursing Officer's recent review of mental health nursing called for the widespread involvement of mental health service users in the education of mental health nurses. This paper describes an innovative project that involved mental health service users in the education of pre-registration mental health nursing students through an online discussion forum that blended e-learning with enquiry-based learning (EBL). The findings of an evaluation are presented, drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the project was a success with students and service users engaging in online discussions on a range of issues. EBL presentations demonstrated understanding of the service user experience and students reflected on implications for clinical practice. All participants would take part again and recommend the online forum to others. Analysis of activity data revealed different levels and styles of student involvement. Limitations in communication skills appeared to limit student participation, alongside logistical difficulties, whereas the service users eagerly utilised the forum. Potential implications for healthcare education are discussed and recommendations made for developments in user-led e-learning and further research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

%X E-learning involves the transfer of skills and knowledge via technology so that learners can access meaningful and authentic educational materials. While learner engagement is important, in the context of healthcare education, pedagogy must not be sacrificed for edu-tainment style instructional design. Consequently, health professional educators need to be competent in the use of current web-based educational technologies so that learners are able to access relevant and engaging e-learning materials without restriction. The increasing popularity of asynchronous e-learning programs developed for use outside of formal education institutions has made this need more relevant. In these contexts, educators must balance design and functionality to deliver relevant, cost-effective, sustainable, and accessible programs that overcome scheduling and geographic barriers for learners. This paper presents 10 guiding design principles and their application in the development of an e-learning program for general practice nurses focused on behavior change. Consideration of these principles will assist educators to develop high quality, pedagogically sound, engaging, and interactive e-learning resources.

%X The use of high-fidelity human patient simulation (HPS) is increasing in nursing education, yet little is known about its use in community health. This study examined an HPS home care experience to determine effects on three outcomes (student satisfaction, self-confidence, and learning). In addition, design characteristics of the simulation and demographic characteristics of students were examined for correlation with these outcomes. Senior baccalaureate students took part in the experience. Results indicated that students were very satisfied with the experience and felt it increased their confidence in providing care in the home, although learning outcomes were not high. Although no demographic characteristics were found to be correlated with outcomes, five design characteristics of a simulation were moderately correlated with the outcomes of satisfaction and self-confidence, especially support. It is recommended that nurse educators design HPS home care simulation experiences that provide student support prior to their first home care visit. © The Author(s) 2011.

%X The paper describes the implementation and acceptance of e-learning in a hospital environment using off-the-shelf technology. Twenty-eight nurses participated in a pilot study that was designed to support an electronic course on advanced electrocardiogram interpretation. The paper presents the procedure and the technologies used to support the e-learning activities. As a follow up of the pilot study, a survey was built and distributed amongst the caregivers of the hospital (N=203). The paper concludes first that the content of the course, a socially structured e-learning environment, as well as the available technologies are important factors to a successful implementation of an e-learning project. Secondly, the paper concludes that the acceptance of such a system to learn is widely supported amongst nurses but seems less convincing to paramedics and physicians. E-learning cannot be perceived as a substitute of a traditional face-to-face education, but when the e-learning environment is socially well structured, it becomes an efficient support to education in the hospital context.

%X Historically, the instructional method of choice has been traditional lecture or face-to-face education; however, changes in the health care environment, including resource constraints, have necessitated examination of this practice. A descriptive pre-/posttest method was used to determine the effectiveness of alternative teaching modalities on nurses' knowledge and confidence in electrocardiogram (EKG) interpretation. A convenience sample of 135 nurses was recruited in an integrated health care system in the Southeastern United States. Nurses attended an instructor-led course, an online learning (e-learning) platform with no study time or 1 week of study time, or an e-learning platform coupled with a 2-hour post-course instructor-facilitated debriefing with no study time or 1 week of study time. Instruments included a confidence scale, an online EKG test, and a course evaluation. Statistically significant differences in knowledge and confidence were found for individual groups after nurses participated in the intervention. Statistically significant differences were found in pre-knowledge and post-confidence when groups were compared. Organizations that use various instructional methods to educate nurses in EKG interpretation can use different teaching modalities without negatively affecting nurses' knowledge or confidence in this skill.

%X Despite the ongoing nursing shortage, nurse educators are responsible for preparing students to practice in highly complex health care systems. As nurse educators explore new learning strategies to support an increase in student admissions, they must also evaluate the impact of these strategies on the quality of the educational experience. The study reported here evaluated the impact of scenario-based, high-fidelity patient simulation used to increase student admissions in an associate degree and baccalaureate nursing program in north-central Texas upon students' sense of their own clinical competence, graduating grade point average (GPA), and performance on standardized exit examinations. These are measures commonly used by nurse educators as metrics of success.

%X Advances in computerized and imaging technology permit both students and doctors to depict the anatomy of the human pelvis more realistically than with previous methods. Further refinements outline fine pelvic structures, such as the nerve plexus, which may as a result be spared during major pelvic surgery, thus preserving the function of the bladder neck and urethra. Dynamic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, coupled with three-dimensional depiction of the lower urinary tract and its adjacent structures, enable visualization of the whole lower urinary tract and the pelvic floor musculature in both continent and incontinent women. In patients with a reconstructed lower urinary tract computer-assisted image processing shows the postoperatively altered topographical anatomy. This may be clinically useful for interpretation of unexpected findings with conventional imaging modalities, postoperative morbidity, and surgical planning of a lower abdominal reoperation. Examples of our own work regarding the innervation of female pelvic organs, dynamic depiction of the bladder and pelvic floor musculature during straining in normal and incontinent women, and the situation of female patients after undergoing an anterior pelvic exenteration with subsequent orthotopic neobladder procedure, are given. In addition, the data of these patients have been compiled for virtual reality endoscopy, which is useful for patient consent and for teaching residents, students and nurses.

%X The School of Health Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (SHS) is planning to expand its contribution to produce more graduate nurses by offering a nursing degree through e-learning. After three years of using e-learning by four lecturers in seven nursing courses, we conducted a study to get the lecturers feedback and to compare the students' preference and their actual experiences in e-learning. Lecturers' feedback were collected based on six open-ended questions. Feedback from all the 36 final year nursing students were collected using Constructivist On-line Learning Environment Survey (COLLES)--the Student Experience/Preferred Form. Results show that lecturers and students have positive perception on e-learning. They perceive e-learning as a powerful and effective tool for expanding nursing education to meet the demand for a labour force that is knowledgeable, highly skilled and equipped with positive values. We believe blended learning is the most suitable approach to implement e-learning and social constructivism theory provides the dynamic view of learning. To increase success in e-learning implementation for the nursing programme, lecturers should be educated regarding proper instructional design so that their content delivery blends well with the technology and pedagogy.

%X This paper describes the development and evaluation of a critical care e-learning scenario for student nurses. At present, there are insufficient opportunities in the United Kingdom (UK) for student nurses to experience clinical placements where their skills in care of the critically-ill can be developed. There is therefore a need for new learning materials that help learners recognise the signs of clinical deterioration and rehearse the management of critically-ill patients. One way of meeting this need is by using electronic care scenarios. Several electronic care scenarios have been developed at Swansea University as part of the eWARD project. This article describes the design and evaluation of a critical care scenario that follows the care of a road casualty (John Macadam) after admission to an intensive care unit. The scenario was designed by an advisory team comprising a clinical lecturer and e-learning specialists. After using the scenario, 144 nursing students completed a Web-based questionnaire that collected demographic and attitudinal data for analysis using SPSS. Nursing students had a strongly positive attitude to the scenario with median scores in excess of 20 compared to maxima of 25 for scales measuring ease-of-use, interactivity, realism and confidence. None of the demographic data collected had a significant effect on these attitudes. The positive attitude of student nurses to this scenario strongly supports its use to help learners to (1) acquire knowledge and awareness when real life placements in these settings are not available and (2) extend their knowledge after coming across similar situations in practice.

%X BACKGROUND: We developed computer-based virtual patient (VP) cases to complement an interactive continuing medical education (CME) course that emphasizes skills practice using standardized patients (SP). Virtual patient simulations have the significant advantages of requiring fewer personnel and resources, being accessible at any time, and being highly standardized. Little is known about the educational effectiveness of these new resources. We conducted a randomized trial to assess the educational effectiveness of VPs and SPs in teaching clinical skills. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of VP cases when compared with live SP cases in improving clinical skills and knowledge. DESIGN: Randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five health care providers (registered nurses 45%, physicians 15%, other provider types 40%) who attended a CME program. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive either 4 live cases (n=32) or 2 live and 2 virtual cases (n=23). Other aspects of the course were identical for both groups. RESULTS: Participants in both groups were equivalent with respect to pre-post workshop improvement in comfort level (P=.66) and preparedness to respond (P=.61), to screen (P=.79), and to care (P=.055) for patients using the skills taught. There was no difference in subjective ratings of effectiveness of the VPs and SPs by participants who experienced both (P=.79). Improvement in diagnostic abilities were equivalent in groups who experienced cases either live or virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in performance and diagnostic ability were equivalent between the groups and participants rated VP and SP cases equally. Including well-designed VPs has a potentially powerful and efficient place in clinical skills training for practicing health care workers.

%X Cost-benefit management trends in Taiwan healthcare settings have led nurses to perform more invasive skills, such as Port-A cath administration of medications. Accordingly, nurses must be well-prepared prior to teaching by the mentor and supervision method. The purpose of the current study was to develop a computer-assisted protocol using virtual reality (VR) in performing Port-A cath as a training program for novice nurses. A pre-tested and post-tested control group experimental design was used in this study. Seventy-seven novice nurses were invited from one large medical center hospital in North Taiwan. Thirty-seven and forty nurses were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. First, we designed a 40 minute port-A cath injection VR simulation. Then, the experimental group practiced this simulation two times over 3 weeks. The control group attended the traditional class. The post-test 1 was right after completion of the simulation practice. The post-test 2 was after the second simulation practice in 3 weeks. The results showed that most novice nurses lacked Port-A cath experience both in the classroom and during the period of their practice training. The knowledge score regarding the Port-A cath technique was significantly higher in the nurses that participated in the simulation training than in the control group. The novice nurses were most satisfied with the reduction in their fear of performing the Port-A cath technique and their enhanced clinical skills. VR simulation significantly reduced error rates and increased correct equipment selection, showing that nurses who participated in the simulation may be better prepared for inserting Port-A cath. © 2006 Springer.

%X The Internet is becoming the preferred place to find information. Millions of people go online in search of health and medical information. Likewise, the demand for Web-based courses is growing. This paper presents the development, utilization, and evaluation of a Web-based e-learning course for nursing students, entitled Integration of Pathophysiology into Pharmacology. The pathophysiology component included cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous and immune system diseases, while the pharmacology component was developed based on 150 commonly used drugs. One hundred and nineteen Year 1 nursing students took part in the course. The Web-based e-learning course materials were uploaded to a WebCT for students' self-directed learning and attempts to pass two scheduled online quizzes. At the end of the semester, students were given a questionnaire to measure the e-learning experience. Their experience in the e-learning course was a positive one. Students stated that they were able to understand rather than memorize the subject content, and develop their problem solving and critical thinking abilities. Online quizzes yielded satisfactory results. In the focus group interview, students indicated that they appreciated the time flexibility and convenience associated with Web-based learning, and also made good suggestions for enhancing Web-based learning. The Web-based approach is promising for teaching and learning pathophysiology and pharmacology for nurses and other healthcare professionals. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

%X With the advancement in educational technology and internet access in recent years, nursing academia is searching for ways to widen nurses' educational opportunities. The online nursing courses are drawing more attention as well. The online nursing courses are very important e-learning tools for nursing students. The research combines the innovation diffusion theory and technology acceptance model, and adds two research variables, perceived financial cost and computer self-efficacy to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model to study nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. Based on 267 questionnaires collected from six universities in Taiwan, the research finds that studies strongly support this new hybrid technology acceptance model in predicting nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. This research finds that compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived financial cost and computer self-efficacy are critical factors for nursing students' behavioral intentions to use the online nursing courses. By explaining nursing students' behavioral intentions from a user's perspective, the findings of this research help to develop more user friendly online nursing courses and also provide insight into the best way to promote new e-learning tools for nursing students. This research finds that compatibility is the most important research variable that affects the behavioral intention to use the online nursing courses.

%X A variety of approaches to teaching and learning are required to encompass the complexity of nursing. Simulated practice involves computer-based simulated environments, human patient simulation and role play, enabling multiple learning objectives to be taught in a realistic clinical environment without harming patients. The Nursing and Midwifery Council recognizes the use of simulated practice and has enabled higher education pre-registration nurse programme providers to incorporate a maximum of 300 hours of simulated practice as part of the 2300-hour practice hours component. However, not all students respond positively to simulated activity, which should be used to augment clinical practice and not replace it. It is important to ensure the quality of the simulation enables the educational experience to be positive for students.

%X Pressure ulcers (PrU) are considered as one of the most challenging problems that Nursing professionals have to deal with in their daily practice. Nowadays, the education on PrUs is mainly based on traditional lecturing, seminars and face-to-face instruction, sometimes with the support of photographs of wounds being used as teaching material. This traditional educational methodology suffers from some important limitations, which could affect the efficacy of the learning process. This current study has been designed to introduce information and communication technologies (ICT) in the education on PrU for undergraduate students, with the main objective of evaluating the advantages an disadvantages of using ICT, by comparing the learning results obtained from using an e-learning tool with those from a traditional teaching methodology. In order to meet this major objective, a web-based learning system named ePULab has been designed and developed as an adaptive e-learning tool for the autonomous acquisition of knowledge on PrU evaluation. This innovative system has been validated by means of a randomized controlled trial that compares its learning efficacy with that from a control group receiving a traditional face-to-face instruction. Students using ePULab gave significantly better (p < 0.01) learning acquisition scores (from pre-test mean 8.27 (SD 1.39) to post-test mean 15.83 (SD 2.52)) than those following traditional lecture-style classes (from pre-test mean 8.23 (SD 1.23) to post-test mean 11.6 (SD 2.52)). In this article, the ePULab software is described in detail and the results from that experimental educational validation study are also presented and analyzed. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

%X Nursing education is challenged to prepare students for complex healthcare needs through the integration of teamwork and informatics. Technology has become an important teaching tool in the blended classroom to enhance group based learning experiences. Faculty evaluation of classroom technologies is imperative prior to adoption. Few studies have directly compared various technologies and their impact on student satisfaction and learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate technology enhanced teaching methods on the learning and satisfaction of graduate students in an advanced pharmacology class using an unfolding case study. After IRB approval, students were randomly assigned to one of three groups: blogging group, wiki group or webinar group. Students completed the evolving case study using the assigned interactive technology. Student names were removed from the case studies. Faculty evaluated the case study using a rubric, while blinded to the assigned technology method used. No significant difference was found on case study grades, the range of grades on the assignment demonstrated little differences between the methods used. Students indicated an overall positive impact related to networking and collaboration on a satisfaction survey. Impact of technology methods needs to be explored in other areas of graduate nursing education.

%X Online simulation provides an alternative approach to hands-on simulation and a number of software packages are becoming available to educators. Lt™ is an online, immersive learning platform, which aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, by using real patient case studies along with interactive exercises. We introduced Lab Tutor™ software as an integral part of our year 3 clinical skills module, alongside the use of the SimMan 3G Advanced Human Patient Simulator (AHPS), with the aim of providing students with a more immersive simulation experience. Lt is now almost completely integrated into all pre-registration nursing courses within the University of the West of Scotland We introduced LabTutor™ to final year nursing students at the beginning of an 11-week clinical skills module. On completion of the module we evaluated the use of the software and whether the students considered that using the interactive software improved their knowledge of disease processes and management of patients. We evaluated results from this pilot study. Early feedback from students indicates that the introduction of LabTutor™ improved understanding of disease processes as well as their management. Following the pilot we contacted ADInstruments and worked closely with them to produce a more nurse related platform with fewer experiments and more nursing intervention We are also in the process of developing a number of patient scenarios, using existing Lt™ patients, for use on the SimMan 3G AHPS.

%X Objective: To prepare students to address the psychosocial needs of patients with cancer and to have an understanding of the challenges faced when identifying resources within the community. Significance and Background: Cancer centers are working to meet the American College of Surgeons 2015 recommendation of psychosocial assessment and appropriate referrals. Nurses and nursing students should be in a position to deliver comprehensive services such as screening, risk assessment, prevention strategies, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and resources for patients from all backgrounds. Nursing professionals have an opportunity to help these patients connect with local resources. Through engaging oncology nurses from the surrounding areas, and nursing students with an interest in oncology, over 500 resources were identified and combined into a mobile application. Purpose: The activity was designed to increase the nursing students' awareness of the challenges a patient with cancer may face when trying to find community resources for their psychosocial needs. Resources that were identified were then used to develop a mobile application for cancer resources. Evaluation: As a result of this activity nursing students were able to identify over 500 cancer resources within the immediate community and surrounding areas. Resources were combined and categorized based on type of service, county and patient population served. Faculty then worked with students from the Computer Sciences Department to develop the mobile application. Discussion: The use of smart phones or similar devices will allow the healthcare provider to provide health information to cancer patients without leaving the chair or bed side and will allow more time for education and interaction with patients.

%X Communications strategies are central to the planning and execution of interprofessional education (IPE) programs. The diversity of telecommunications-based tools and plat- forms available for IPE is rapidly expanding. Each tool and platform has a potentially important role to play. The selection, testing, and embedding of tools, such as social networking platforms, within education programs can be very challenging. The goal was to create, in Phoenix, a "command-and-control" video conferencing center (the "T-Health Amphitheater" or "Telehealth Amphitheater") in which tele-consultation patients, located physically at one of the affiliated tele-clinics around the state, could be presented electronically to interprofessional teams of faculty members from the University of Arizona Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Public Health, as well as those from the allied health colleges of other universities in Arizona, for interprofessional team training in a virtual classroom setting. The T-Health video conferencing facility was designed and built. Early assessments show that its novel learning environment is student- and facultyfriendly. T-Health Amphitheater's pair of innovative visible social networking platforms (eStacks™and eSwaps™) may help break down some of the traditional communications barriers encountered in healthcare IPE and medical practices.

%X Purpose: To describe the use of human patient simulation (HPS) scenarios in interprofessional education involving students from different healthcare disciplines representing three regional colleges. Methods: Since May 2009, faculty from the Washington State University (WSU) Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing and University of Washington (UW) physician assistant (PA) program have collaborated to conduct interprofessional HPS scenarios in the following content areas: Adult Shortness of Breath, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) and Pediatric Respiratory Distress. Doctor of Pharmacy (WSU), Nursing (WSU and Spokane Community College) and PA (UW) students were included in all three scenarios with the addition of first year medical students (UW) during the ACLS scenario. Each scenario lasted approximately 20 minutes and was immediately followed with a 30-minute debriefing session facilitated by faculty from all disciplines. The four global learning objectives for each simulation included the following: • Demonstrate appropriate discipline specific skills. • Diagnose and implement appropriate initial treatment plan. • Demonstrate professional communication skills in a healthcare team. • Communicate effectively when giving a patient case report for nursing change of shift and/or a clinical case presentation to a consultant or preceptor. Results: Throughout the three scenarios, a total of 23 students from the various programs participated. During the debriefing session, students were able to reflect on their individual roles as well as the interactions of the team. For each scenario a common theme has emerged centering on lack of familiarity with each other's roles. Conclusions: These simulation scenarios are unique because multiple healthcare disciplines and different academic institutions all worked together. Challenges included the coordination of academic and class schedules across programs and matching appropriate skill levels amongst the students. Continued efforts are underway to expand interprofessional opportunities to allow wider student participation and to develop scenarios in other areas of practice.

%X AIM The purpose of this study was to determine whether a difference exists in learner performance and the type and frequency of diagnostic reasoning skills used, based on the method of case presentation. BACKGROUND Faculty can select from a variety of methods for presenting cases when teaching diagnostic reasoning, but little evidence exists with regard to how students use these skills while interacting with the cases. METHOD A total of 54 nursing students participated in two case analyses using human patient and computer-based simulations. Participant performance and diagnostic reasoning skills were analyzed. RESULTS Performance was significantly better with the human patient simulation case. All diagnostic reasoning skills were used during both methods of case presentation, with greater performance variation in the computer-based simulation. CONCLUSION Both human patient and computer-based simulations are beneficial for practicing diagnostic reasoning skills; however, these findings support the use of human patient simulations for improving student performance in case synthesis.

%X Background and Aims:E-learning is developing fast because of the rapid increased use of smartphones, tablets and portable computers. We might not think of it as e-learning, but today many new e-books are in fact very complex electronic teaching platforms. It is generally accepted that e-learning is as effective as classroom teaching methods, but little is known about its value in relaying contents of different levels of complexity to students. We set out to investigate e-learning effects on simple recall and complex problem-solving compared to classroom teaching.Methods:63 nurses specializing in anesthesiology were evenly randomized into three groups. They were given internet-based knowledge tests before and after attending a teaching module about respiratory physiology and pulmonology. The three groups was either an e-learning group with eBook teaching material, an e-learning group with case-based teaching or a group with face-to-face case-based classroom teaching. After the module the students were required to answer a post-test. Time spent and the number of logged into the system was also measured.Results:For simple recall, all methods were equally effective. For problem-solving, the eCase group achieved a comparable knowledge level to classroom teaching, while textbook learning was inferior to both (p<0.01). The textbook group also spent the least amount of time on acquiring knowledge (33 minutes, p<0.001), while the eCase group spent significantly more time on the subject (53 minutes, p<0.001) and logged into the system significantly more (2.8 vs 1.6, p<0.001).Conclusions:E-learning based cases are an effective tool for teaching complex knowledge and problem-solving ability, but future studies using higher-level e-learning are encouraged.Simple recall skills, however, do not require any particular learning method. © 2013 Bjarne Skjødt Worm.

%X Introduction. Basic comprehensive training of intensive care staff is of great importance to ensure that best practice is maintained. The training of junior medical staff and senior nurses to date, usually takes place at the bedside or on high fidelity simulators only located in major tertiary teaching institutions. Training on these simulators is limited by cost, availability and the small number of users per training session. To address this problem, four partner countries of the CRITICAL Project (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) have developed a Virtual Intensive Care Patient (VIP) which will have access globally via the internet. Method. A virtual patient has been created using EduCAT© Software supplied by a SME Gazebo Computers Ltd who is also a partner in the project. This programme uses a simple toolset designed for teachers, (not programmers), allowing them to modify their own interactive material relatively quickly and cheaply. The project partners will deliver the VIP beginning with four scenarios of Shock to allow intensive care staff to treat a patient using various treatment modalities. Discussion. Junior intensive care staff utilizing the VIP will be able to try alternative treatments for the scenarios and observe patient outcomes faster than in real life, without any danger to patients. The programme can be used by students and junior staff for revision purposes or by teachers for stand-alone teaching sessions or for assessment of competence and confidence of practice. Conclusion. European experts in intensive care will develop and rigorously test the medical scenarios which will be constantly evaluated and refined throughout the project lifecycle. The result will be a screen-based simulation in four languages of a patient available on-line via the CRITICAL website (http://www.critical-project.net) accessed via a log-in code. Teachers will be able to customize the VIP to suit their specialty topic and a collaborative on-line forum for users will provide user feedback and sharing of the latest best practice.

%X In recent years, mobile device-assisted clinical education has become popular among nursing school students. The introduction of mobile devices saves manpower and reduces errors while enhancing nursing students' professional knowledge and skills. To respond to the demands of various learning strategies and to maintain existing systems of education, the concept of Cloud Learning is gradually being introduced to instructional environments. Cloud computing facilitates learning that is personalized, diverse, and virtual. This study involved assessing the advantages of mobile devices and Cloud Learning in a public health practice course, in which Google+ was used as the learning platform, integrating various application tools. Users could save and access data by using any wireless Internet device. The platform was student centered and based on resource sharing and collaborative learning. With the assistance of highly flexible and convenient technology, certain obstacles in traditional practice training can be resolved. Our findings showed that the students who adopted Google+ were learned more effectively compared with those who were limited to traditional learning systems. Most students and the nurse educator expressed a positive attitude toward and were satisfied with the innovative learning method.

%X New technologies give nurse academicians the opportunity to incorporate innovative teaching-learning strategies into the nursing curricula. Mobile technology for learning, or m-learning, has considerable potential for the nursing classroom but lacks sufficient empirical evidence to support its use. Based on Mayer's multimedia learning theory, the effect of using cooperative and interactive m-learning techniques in enhancing classroom and clinical learning was explored. The relationship between m-learning and students' learning styles was determined through a multimethod educational research study involving nurse practitioner students at two mid-Atlantic universities. During the 16-month period, nurse practitioner students and their faculty used personal digital assistants (PDAs) to participate in various m-learning activities. Findings from focus group and survey responses concluded that PDAs, specifically the Pocket PC, are useful reference tools in the clinical setting and that all students, regardless of learning style, benefited from using PDAs. It was also demonstrated that connecting students with classmates and other nurse practitioner students at distant universities created a cooperative learning community providing additional support and knowledge acquisition. The authors concluded that in order to successfully prepare nurse practitioner graduates with the skills necessary to function in the present and future health care system, nurse practitioner faculty must be creative and innovative, incorporating various revolutionary technologies into their nurse practitioner curricula.

%X Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is the major complication of central venous catheters (CVC). The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of a hospital-wide strategy on CLABSI reduction. Between 2008 and 2011, all CVCs were observed individually and hospital-wide at a large university-affiliated, tertiary care hospital. CVC insertion training started from the 3rd quarter and a total of 146 physicians employed or newly entering the hospital were trained in simulator workshops. CVC care started from quarter 7 and a total of 1274 nurses were trained by their supervisors using a web-based, modular, e-learning programme. The study included 3952 patients with 6353 CVCs accumulating 61,366 catheter-days. Hospital-wide, 106 patients had 114 CLABSIs with a cumulative incidence of 1.79 infections per 100 catheters. We observed a significant quarterly reduction of the incidence density (incidence rate ratios [95% confidence interval]: 0.92 [0.88-0.96]; P<0.001) after adjusting for multiple confounders. The incidence densities (n/1000 catheter-days) in the first and last study year were 2.3/1000 and 0.7/1000 hospital-wide, 1.7/1000 and 0.4/1000 in the intensive care units, and 2.7/1000 and 0.9/1000 in non-intensive care settings, respectively. Median time-to-infection was 15 days (Interquartile range, 8-22). Our findings suggest that clinically relevant reduction of hospital-wide CLABSI was reached with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and multimodal quality improvement programme including aspects of behavioural change and key principles of good implementation practice. This is one of the first multimodal, multidisciplinary, hospital-wide training strategies successfully reducing CLABSI. © 2014 Zingg et al.

%X Background and aims Neuromonitoring, using amplitude-integrated Electroencephalography (aEEG) and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS), is common practice on our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The quality of the registration depends on the application of the aEEG-needles or hydrogel electrodes and the NIRS-pad, handling the equipment and interpretation of the registration. Incorrect placement of the electrodes (too close to each other) by untrained nursing staff can lead to a registration full of artefacts, which may be interpreted as epileptic events or epileptic events may be missed. The correct interpretation of the aEEG patterns has a complex learning curve. Method An e-learning course about monitoring the neonatal brain was developed to ensure that nurses are able to learn at any time, at any place on any computer. The hospital provided an e-learning-team. The e-learning course is located at a virtual learning environment which every member of the hospital staff has access to. Results We developed an e-learning course which provides an interactive teaching tool to learn all about the near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) and four different aEEG monitor devices. Quizzes are included to practice how to interpret the aEEG recordings, which is essential in evaluating the monitoring of the neonatal brain. Conclusion E-learning is an interactive learning tool which will enable the staff to keep their skills up to date in using different NIRS- and aEEG monitors and will allow correct interpretation of the aEEG recordings.
