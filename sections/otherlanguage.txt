%X High-fidelity patient simulation teaching represents one of the most important innovations in healthcare education in the past two decades. In Taiwan, many medical centers and medical colleges now have clinical skill centers equipped with a high-fidelity patient simulator. Practicing clinical scenarios in this simulated environment can help strengthen students' professional essentials and competencies outside of classroom and clinical teaching settings. High-fidelity simulation teaching is an integrated teaching strategy that is continuing to receive greater attention. This article describes the historical development of high-fidelity patient simulation teaching, its current status, and applications in nursing education as a reference for nursing educators.
