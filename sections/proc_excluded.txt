%X SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Cancer and its treatment has significant impacts on the quality of life of patients and their families. A significant portion of patients experience distress and most patients will benefit through the integration of emotional care throughout their care experience. Nurses play an important role in providing this care and in facilitating appropriate referrals where further expertise or assessment is needed. However, evidence suggests despite a strong desire to integrate this aspect of care into their practice, nurses lack confidence and skill in assessing and managing the complex communication and adjustment issues experiences by patients and their families. Furthermore, although there is some awareness of assessment tools or methods, most nurses do not utilize them or feel uncertain as to how to make referrals with the exception of cases of extreme distress. Purpose: This symposium will provide an overview of a publically funded provincial approach to provide continuing educational courses and as well as at graduate level to nurses at any point along the cancer continuum to assist them to feel more confident and skilled in assessment and provision of emotional care to patients and their families. Learning models include train the trainer programs, elearning modes as well as clinical mentorship. Qualitative and quantitative findings from train the trainer programs and elearning approaches will be presented with a discussion on the implications of the program.
